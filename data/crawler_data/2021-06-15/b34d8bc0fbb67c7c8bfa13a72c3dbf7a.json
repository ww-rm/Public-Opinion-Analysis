To help riders prepare for the tests, e-handbooks in these languages have been made available at go.gov.sg/amrules.This will comprise 30 multiple-choice questions for the e-scooter test and 40 for the PAB test, with 30 minutes and 40 minutes given respectively to complete the tests. A digital certificate, with no expiry date, will be issued to those who pass. The passing score is 80 per cent.Riders, who must be at least 16 years old, must register for an account on the theory test portal using their SingPass at least a day before taking the test. E-scooter riders below the age of 16 can only ride under adult supervision, and the supervising adult will need to have passed the test.Those who register for the test from 30 June to 30 September will enjoy a discounted fee of $5 per test, with a free second attempt should they fail on the first. Riders who register after 30 September must pay $10 per test attempt. There will be a transition period of six months – 30 June to 31 December – for riders to prepare, take and complete the test before enforcement kicks in. From 1 January 2022, riders must show their digital certificate when requested by enforcement officers.  Stay in the know on-the-go: Join Yahoo Singapore's Telegram channel at http://t.me/YahooSingaporeMore stories:Singapore reports 13 new COVID-19 cases, 10 from the communityStudents to gradually return to school from 28 June: MOESHN rules for travellers from Fiji tightened, for travellers from Israel easedThe Ministry of Health (MOH) on Tuesday (15 June) confirmed 14 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore, taking the country's total case count to 62,315.A landlord who kept exposing himself to a female tenant was jailed for 11 weeks and fined $2,000 on Tuesday (15 June) after he was found guilty of all six related charges.Search for private jet membership.
