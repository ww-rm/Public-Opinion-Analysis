With this profit re-allocation rule, part of the profits from such hub operations may be re-allocated to the market jurisdictions,” he said.That said, there might be a near-term boost.PwC's Mr Woo reckoned that Singapore “could potentially gain more corporate tax revenue if tax incentives are withdrawn” from the relevant companies once the global minimum corporate tax rate kicks in.TOO EARLY TO PREDICT IMPACT ON INVESTMENTS, ECONOMYMr Wee said these reforms in global tax rules are “creating uncertainty which may cause delays in investment decisions”.Those with a presence in Singapore and which are affected by the new proposed rules “can certainly be expected to re-assess their investments if Singapore’s tax incentives no longer present a benefit due to the ‘top-up’ of taxes,” said Mr Woo.But there might not be a “uniform response across the board” as certain investments such as those in the technology space, “are more mobile than others”, he added.“Big tech can move more easily compared to manufacturing but even then, it depends on availability of a skilled workforce. Others who are seeking to apply other strategies such as the diversification of supply chains or require proximity to markets may be less inclined to move.What companies that can afford to move will be considering is the non-tax benefits of operating in Singapore and whether other measures will be doled out to attract them to remain in Singapore, said Mr Woo.But while there is the risk, experts told CNA that Singapore’s long-term attractiveness to MNCs around the world is unlikely to be dampened based on taxation changes alone.CIMB Private Bank economist Song Seng Wun said: “Singapore isn’t an idyllic island under the sun where nothing goes on. Real economic activities are taking place here, with businesses setting up offices and factories because it is attractive for them to do so.“And not because the tax incentives are attractive - if it was just that, anyone can out-incentivise us.”Singapore's infrastructure, rule of law, stable political environment, as well as connectivity to regional and global economies are among the “intangibles that companies also consider beyond the dollar and cents”, he added.“Because we know that businesses are in in Singapore more than just tax reasons, as long as Singapore’s overall package remains attractive, (the new tax rules are) not a significant issue at the moment.”Echoing that, KPMG Singapore’s partner and head of tax Ajay Kumar Sanganeria said “it is too early to predict overall outcomes” but Singapore will remain a relevant regional hub due to benefits such as the availability of highly-trained talents, strong protection of intellectual property and its reputation as a global financial hub.That said, the cost of doing business remains a concern for companies. To continue attracting MNCs, Singapore may need to enhance support for innovation, training or other value-added activities, he added.Mr Rolfe also mentioned that there is “a very large pool” of MNCs that will not be impacted by the proposed global minimum rate and these MNCs will continue to be attracted to Singapore.More importantly, the tax reforms do not apply to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as they fall beneath the expected threshold.“SMEs represent the majority of economic activity in many jurisdictions and their taxation situation will not change under these proposed rules,” said the KPMG tax expert.“In summary, it is too early to identify the financial impact on Singapore,” he said.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "G7,corporate tax,Singapore economy", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/g7-global-minimum-corporate-tax-corporates-singapore-14992592", "Source": "google"}
