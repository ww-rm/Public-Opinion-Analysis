If he could, he would probably charge her under every law available.”Human Rights Watch said the allegations were “bogus and politically motivated” with the intention of nullifying the NLD victory and preventing Aung San Suu Kyi from running for office again.“This trial is clearly the opening salvo in an overall strategy to neuter Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy party as a force that can challenge military rule in the future,” said deputy Asia director Phil Robertson.Near-daily protests have rocked Myanmar since the generals’ February 1 putsch. A mass uprising has been met with a brutal military crackdown that has killed more than 850 civilians, according to a local monitoring group.Analysts say army chief Min Aung Hlaing determined to sideline hugely popular leader and reshape political landscape.Military attacks have forced villagers into the jungle and stiffened the resolve of those fighting against the coup.Protesters demand firmer action against military leaders’ February power grab and recognition of civilian government.Men in embattled town of Mindat flee to the hills as military steps up crackdown on resistance to February 1 coup.Follow Al Jazeera English:", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/14/trial-of-myanmars-suu-kyi-gets", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
