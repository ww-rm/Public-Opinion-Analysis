Follow our guide to watch a Hungary vs Portugal live stream and watch the Euro 2020 Group F game from anywhere.Date: Tuesday, June 15Kick-off time: 5pm BST / 6pm CET / 12pm ET / 9am PT / 2am AEST / 4am NZSTVenue: Puskás Aréna, Budapest, HungaryFree live streams: ITV HubGlobal live streams: ESPN via Sling TV or FuboTV (US) | Optus Sport (AUS) | TSN/TVA Sports (CAN) | Sky Sport (NZ)Watch anywhere: try ExpressVPN 100% risk-freeWith France and Germany facing off later, Group F is one of the deathliest Groups of Death in memory, and the pressure's on Portugal right from the start.Beating Hungary is the minimal requirement for Portugal, who are hotly tipped as one of the favourites for the tournament. Fernando Santos has an abundance of talent at his disposal, with key men including Rúben Dias, Raphael Guerreiro, Bruno Fernandes, Bernardo Silva and João Félix. Hungary, meanwhile, have been widely written off as the whipping boys of the group, but Marco Rossi's side are unbeaten in 11 and will be buoyed by 61,000 home fans.We're certainly hoping for another classic in a repeat from five years ago when CR7 scored twice as Portugal came back from behind three times to seal a 3-3 draw, with the woodwork denying Hungary a famous victory.Can they pull off another shock?
