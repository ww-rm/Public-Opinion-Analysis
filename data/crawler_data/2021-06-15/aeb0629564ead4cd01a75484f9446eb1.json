Instead they were trying to understand how the virus might jump across species.“My lab has never conducted or cooperated in conducting GOF experiments that enhance the virulence of viruses,” she said.— AFP © 2006 - 2021 The Online Citizen© 2006 - 2021 The Online Citizen", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2021/06/15/chinese-scientist-at-center-of-virus-controversy-denies-lab-leak-theory/", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
