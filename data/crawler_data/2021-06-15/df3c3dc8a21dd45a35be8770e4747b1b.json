If there weren't one, we'd have to invent it,\" he said.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "Beijing,China,NATO,military", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/beijing-accuses-nato-of-exaggerating--china-threat-theory--15017546", "Source": "google"}
