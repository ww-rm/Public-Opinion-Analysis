We got him back after one defib (defibrillation),\" Morten Boesen told a news conference, adding that Eriksen remained in hospital for further tests after his collapse on Saturday.\"The exams that have been done so far look fine,\" Boesen added. \"We don't have an explanation to why it happened.\"Eriksen, 29, collapsed suddenly in the 42nd minute of the match while running near the left touchline after a Denmark throw-in.
