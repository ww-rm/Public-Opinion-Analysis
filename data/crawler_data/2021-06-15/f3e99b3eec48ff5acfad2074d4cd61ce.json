Instead they were trying to understand how the virus might jump across species.\"My lab has never conducted or cooperated in conducting GOF experiments that enhance the virulence of viruses,” she said.jh/st/An ex-naval officer charged for not wearing a mask in numerous places returned to court again on Tuesday (15 June) claiming that it was not possible for her to have a fair hearing due to previous cases involving the Singapore Armed Forces.A nurse accused of neglect in Diego Maradona's death told Argentine prosecutors on Monday that he was following orders \"not to disturb\" the football icon while he slept.Search for private jet membership.
