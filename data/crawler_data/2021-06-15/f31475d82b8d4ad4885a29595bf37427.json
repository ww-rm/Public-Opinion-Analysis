Instead they were trying to understand how the virus might jump across species.\"My lab has never conducted or cooperated in conducting GOF experiments that enhance the virulence of viruses,” she said.jh/st/Dickson Yeo, the Singaporean man who was jailed in the US for spying for China and was arrested by the Internal Security Department upon his return to Singapore in December will be continue to be detained under the Internal Security Act.An ex-naval officer charged for not wearing a mask in numerous places returned to court again on Tuesday (15 June) claiming that it was not possible for her to have a fair hearing due to previous cases involving the Singapore Armed Forces.Search for private jet membership.
