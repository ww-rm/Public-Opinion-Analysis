In need of money, he placed an advertisement on Locanto, which he had downloaded two years ago in order to earn money by providing sexual services.The advertisement was titled \"Toyboy Fantasy Satisfies you- 18”, and stated that he was looking for a “sugar mummy” who could pay him in return for sexual services. He included his mobile phone number and two photographs of himself.The next day, AL-Masfuiin saw the advertisement and decided to chat up the victim while posing as a woman. He told the boy, “I’m looking for a young boy to be my sex slave” and asked the victim for his photographs and body statistics.When the victim asked if he was male or female, AL-Masfuiin said she was female. The victim told him that he was 17 years old and in need of money as he had been chased out of his house.As a “woman”, AL-Masfuiin asked the victim for a threesome with “her” and “her boyfriend”, even though there would be no female involved. The victim agreed and asked for $250 per meet up.At about 10.38pm that day, the victim messaged AL-Masfuiin to ask if they were able to meet up. AL-Masfuiin was aware that the victim had no place to stay.He told the victim that he could stay at “her boyfriend’s place” and that “he’ll send a Grab to let you stay over”. AL-Masfuiin texted that he also expected the boy to service “her boyfriend”.AL-Masfuiin then arranged transport for the victim. At about 1am on 18 June 2019, AL-Masfuiin sent a Grab to the victim, who asked AL-Masfuiin if “she” was joining the sex session. AL-Masfuiin replied “she might not” but that her “boyfriend will tell me if you did a great job at sex”.When the victim asked if the boyfriend knew his age, AL-Masfuiin replied “yes” and “I like my boys young”.After the victim arrived at AL-Masfuiin’s apartment, AL-Masfuiin told him to take a shower while he sat on the sofa bed in the living room masturbating himself. The two engaged in sexual acts, with AL-Masfuiin overpowering the boy when the latter resisted. After the incident, the boy went to sleep.He woke at about 8.30am and asked AL-Masfuiin for money to go to work. AL-Masfuiin took out a $50 note from his wallet and handed it to the victim before the two parted ways.According to court documents, a police officer performing foot patrol came across the victim on 18 June 2019 at Toa Payoh Central.
