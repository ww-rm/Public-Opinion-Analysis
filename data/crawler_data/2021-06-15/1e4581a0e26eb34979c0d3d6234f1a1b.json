In need of money, he placed an advertisement on Locanto, which he had downloaded two years ago in order to earn money by providing sexual services.The advertisement was titled \"Toyboy Fantasy Satisfies you- 18”, and stated that he was looking for a “sugar mummy” who could pay him in return for sexual services. He included his mobile phone number and two photographs of himself.The next day, AL-Masfuiin saw the advertisement and decided to chat up the victim while posing as a woman. He told the boy, “I’m looking for a young boy to be my sex slave” and asked the victim for his photographs and body statistics.When the victim asked if he was male or female, AL-Masfuiin said she was female. The victim told him that he was 17 years old and in need of money as he had been chased out of his house.As a “woman”, AL-Masfuiin asked the victim for a threesome with “her” and “her boyfriend”, even though there would be no female involved. The victim agreed and asked for $250 per meet up.At about 10.38pm that day, the victim messaged AL-Masfuiin to ask if they were able to meet up. AL-Masfuiin was aware that the victim had no place to stay.He told the victim that he could stay at “her boyfriend’s place” and that “he’ll send a Grab to let you stay over”. AL-Masfuiin texted that he also expected the boy to service “her boyfriend”.AL-Masfuiin then arranged transport for the victim. At about 1am on 18 June 2019, AL-Masfuiin sent a Grab to the victim, who asked AL-Masfuiin if “she” was joining the sex session. AL-Masfuiin replied “she might not” but that her “boyfriend will tell me if you did a great job at sex”.When the victim asked if the boyfriend knew his age, AL-Masfuiin replied “yes” and “I like my boys young”.After the victim arrived at AL-Masfuiin’s apartment, AL-Masfuiin told him to take a shower while he sat on the sofa bed in the living room masturbating himself. The two engaged in sexual acts, with AL-Masfuiin overpowering the boy when the latter resisted. After the incident, the boy went to sleep.He woke at about 8.30am and asked AL-Masfuiin for money to go to work. AL-Masfuiin took out a $50 note from his wallet and handed it to the victim before the two parted ways.According to court documents, a police officer performing foot patrol came across the victim on 18 June 2019 at Toa Payoh Central. During the course of investigations, the officer discovered messages relating to him providing sexual services, in his phone. AL-Masfuiin was arrested afterwards. Commercial sex with a minor under 18 carries a jail term of up to seven years, with fine, or both. Stay in the know on-the-go: Join Yahoo Singapore's Telegram channel at http://t.me/YahooSingaporeMore Singapore stories:Singapore reports 13 new COVID-19 cases, 10 from the communityCOVID: Social gathering size can increase to 5 per group from 14 June – MTFCOVID: Dine-in at F&B places can resume at max 5 per group from 21 JuneWork-from-home remains default arrangement in Singapore's Phase 3 (HA)4 COVID ART test kits on sale at 3 Singapore pharmacies from 16 June: MTFBeijing on Tuesday accused NATO of exaggerating the threat from China and \"creating confrontation\", after a vow from the Western allies to work together to counter the \"systemic challenges\" posed by its policies.An ex-naval officer charged for not wearing a mask in numerous places returned to court again on Tuesday (15 June) claiming that it was not possible for her to have a fair hearing due to previous cases involving the Singapore Armed Forces.A nurse accused of neglect in Diego Maradona's death told Argentine prosecutors on Monday that he was following orders \"not to disturb\" the football icon while he slept.Spain opened their Euro 2020 campaign with a goalless draw against Sweden in Seville on Monday after their preparations were badly affected by Covid-19, while Patrik Schick scored one of the championship's great goals in the Czech Republic's 2-0 win over Scotland.The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (14 June) confirmed 25 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore, taking the country's total case count to 62,301.Dickson Yeo, the Singaporean man who was jailed in the US for spying for China and was arrested by the Internal Security Department upon his return to Singapore in December will be continue to be detained under the Internal Security Act.Anti-junta protesters flooded Myanmar's social media with pictures of themselves wearing black on Sunday in a show of solidarity with the Rohingya, a minority group that is among the most persecuted in the country.Here are three growing businesses that should be cheap enough to add to your investment watchlist.
