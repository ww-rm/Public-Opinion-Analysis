He did not provide a specific number. Carro will use the fresh capital to expand into new locations and grow its business in its existing markets - Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore. It also plans to expand its portfolio of financial services and accelerate development of artificial intelligence capabilities. Carro's platform allows consumers and wholesale businesses to buy and sell vehicles along with providing insurance and financing services. Other investors in the new round of financing include several prominent Indonesian based funds including EV Growth, it said. Since being founded in 2015, Carro has raised more than $400 million in equity and $200 million in debt. Its previous investors include SoftBank Ventures Asia, EDBI Pte, Insignia Ventures Partners and B Capital Group. The company has started preparing internally for an initial public offering (IPO), Tan said. \"The plan is to IPO the company, hopefully, in the next 18-24 months in the U.S., depending on whether the market holds,\" he said. While Carro saw an initial decline in business due to the COVID-19 pandemic, like other digital businesses, the company is now benefiting from users shifting to online transactions. \"People are more willing to buy vehicles entirely online without the need to visit a showroom,\" he said.  Carro booked revenues of $300 million for the year ending March 2021 and has registered positive EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) for two years. (Reporting by Aradhana Aravindan in Singapore Editing by Ed Davies) Dickson Yeo, the Singaporean man who was jailed in the US for spying for China and was arrested by the Internal Security Department upon his return to Singapore in December will be continue to be detained under the Internal Security Act.Reigning champions Portugal begin their defence of the trophy against Hungary at Euro 2020 in Budapest on Tuesday as World Cup holders France take on Germany in a hotly-anticipated clash between two of the continent's heavyweights.So many people in the US are ordering this portable AC unit for the hot summer ahead that delivery companies can't keep up with the demand!An ex-naval officer charged for not wearing a mask in numerous places returned to court again on Tuesday (15 June) claiming that it was not possible for her to have a fair hearing due to previous cases involving the Singapore Armed Forces.Elon Musk tweeted that he’s decided to sell his last remaining house a week after a report said he and others billionaires paid little or no income taxes for several years.The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (14 June) confirmed 25 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore, taking the country's total case count to 62,301.Drivers in Texas can't believe this is true.US President Joe Biden will seek the EU's backing on Tuesday to face the rise of China, but Brussels wants a swift end to lingering trade rows and a clean break from Donald Trump.Malaysia on Sunday deported a leading figure in conspiracy circles who is wanted in France over the kidnapping of an eight-year-old girl, sources told AFP.An American father-son duo admitted to helping orchestrate former Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn's audacious escape from Japan as they made their first appearance before a Tokyo court on Monday.Receive an education in blockchain from leading MIT faculty and cryptoeconomics experts.Here are three growing businesses that should be cheap enough to add to your investment watchlist.
