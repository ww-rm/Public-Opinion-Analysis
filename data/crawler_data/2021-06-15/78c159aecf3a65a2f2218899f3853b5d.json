The incident on 15 May was caught in a viral video showing Phoon demanding to see the SDA's badge. Phoon also removed her mask after leaving court on 24 May, when she was photographed and filmed by the media.At her Tuesday hearing, the prosecution told the court that Phoon may face additional charges, including those from the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority. Phoon, who represented herself, stated that she was an ex-naval officer who had a \"number of incidents\" when she was a \"plaintiff\" or \"eyewitness\" to many cases, and as such, it was \"not possible\" for her to have a fair hearing. \"I am not privy to discuss all these cases in court here without causing embarrassment or being prejudicial to the SAF and to the government of Singapore (so I) am applying for all these charges to be dropped,\" she said. When probed on her cases with the SAF, Phoon repeated her allegations, adding, \"Due to all these cases in the past, I should be granted immunity as a citizen.\" Phoon described the cases as \"grave\" and \"very serious in nature\". DJ Wang then responded that her case with the SAF would not be relevant to her present charges, and that the court would not be cognisant of those charges. In reply, Phoon said, \"I beg to differ.\"The judge then adjourned the case to 6 July, pending her additional charges and for Phoon to seek legal advice. The maximum penalty for breaching COVID-19 measures is six months' jail and a fine of $10,000. Repeat offenders can be jailed for up to one year and fined up to $20,000.Stay in the know on-the-go: Join Yahoo Singapore's Telegram channel at http://t.me/YahooSingaporeRelated stories:Woman, without mask in viral MBS video, asks judge to drop chargesWoman charged for not wearing mask at MBS, outside court and elsewhereWoman in viral video at MBS seen outside court without maskWoman in viral video at MBS claims trial to not wearing mask charge in separate incidentDickson Yeo, the Singaporean man who was jailed in the US for spying for China and was arrested by the Internal Security Department upon his return to Singapore in December will be continue to be detained under the Internal Security Act.Elon Musk tweeted that he’s decided to sell his last remaining house a week after a report said he and others billionaires paid little or no income taxes for several years.Search for private jet membership.
