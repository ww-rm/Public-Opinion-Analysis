(But) for me, they are good enough.\"We have got very good players - Thiago (Alcantara) in midfield will be key. He is a player who can create something out of nothing.\"There are players like (striker) Gerard Moreno who can kill the game in a single second because he has been fantastic this whole season.\"Cesc Fabregas, who was involved in Spain's era of success from 2008-2012, also was optimistic about Enrique's charges, who are the fifth-youngest team at the Euros.He told Goal.com: \"I don't like it when we are complaining before the tournament starts about the squad.\"I had it in 2008 when I was 21, I think. There was (David) Silva and (Andres) Iniesta coming through, and everyone was doubting us a bit because Raul (Gonzalez), (Michel) Salgado, (Santiago) Canizares and (David) Albelda weren't called up.\"All those players were cast aside to make space for us young players.\"We ended up winning the tournament and I don't think I need to repeat what happened after... It will not be easy for Spain... It is a young team but they have proven that they can play well in qualification.\"Get The New Paper on your phone with the free TNP app. Download from the Apple App StoreÂ or Google Play Store now", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.tnp.sg/sports/football/lack-expectation-may-be-good-spain-luis-garcia", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
