The Chinese government has also not given any indication that Dr Shi’s lab is under any degree of suspicion in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.The virologist has been able to continue her work and give lectures in the country.In a recent letter in the journal Science, 18 scientists called for a transparent investigation to look into all possible scenarios, including the possibility of a lab leak.The letter also stresses the importance of a “dispassionate science-based discourse” on the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, with researchers noting the rise of “anti-Asian sentiment in some countries” in the midst of the pandemic.“In this time of unfortunate anti-Asian sentiment in some countries, we note that at the beginning of the pandemic, it was Chinese doctors, scientists, journalists, and citizens who shared with the world crucial information about the spread of the virus – often at great personal cost,” the letter states.“We should show the same determination in promoting a dispassionate science-based discourse on this difficult but important issue,” researchers write.Speaking with the Times, David Relman a microbiologist at Stanford University who co-authored the letter, said: “This has nothing to do with fault or guilt.”“It’s just bigger than any one scientist or institute or any one country – anybody anywhere who has data of this sort needs to put it out there,” he said.Read MoreWorkers push back against hospitals requiring COVID vaccinesUS bans dogs brought in from 100 countries with rabies riskUS intel report warns of more violence by QAnon followersChristopher Sign broke story of tarmac meeting between Bill Clinton and AG Loretta Lynch during 2016 campaign between Hillary and TrumpThe first-of-its kind heavy launcher aims to carry the first in a series of missions to bring humans back to the moon by 2024.Have you considered how you'll withdraw your retirement income?
