If there weren't one, we'd have to invent it,\" he said.And he stressed once again that Article 5 of the NATO treaty - the obligation of members to defend one another, once called into question by Trump - was a \"sacred obligation\".\"We're not entering a new Cold War and China is not our adversary, not our enemy,\" Stoltenberg told reporters as he arrived at NATO headquarters ahead of the leaders.ERDOGAN TALKSLooming large at the summit is also the scramble to complete NATO's hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan after Biden surprised partners by ordering US troops home by Sep 11.France's President Emmanuel Macron met one-on-one with his Turkish counterpart and fellow ally Recep Tayyip Erdogan ahead of the summit, and Biden was due to meet him later.On the table will be Ankara's offer to secure Kabul airport after NATO troops leave - but also concerns in other capitals about Turkey's own aggressive regional policy.The final statement did not mention Turkey's role at the airport, but did stress that the alliance would continue to pay to keep the facility open.Some allies are concerned about the rush to leave Afghanistan and some had questioned the strategy of an alliance that Macron warned in 2019 was undergoing \"brain death\".Other leaders arriving for the talks dismissed this phrase, but European leaders stressed that they did not want to be drawn into a US confrontation with China at the cost of focusing on Russia.The summit at NATO's cavernous Brussels headquarters is set to greenlight a 2030 reform programme.The leaders will agree to rewrite the core \"strategic concept\" to face a world where cyber attacks, climate change, and new technologies pose new threats.Moscow's 2014 seizure of Crimea from Ukraine gave renewed purpose to NATO and fellow leaders were keen to sound Biden out ahead of his Wednesday meeting with Putin.On China, Biden is picking up from where Trump left off by getting NATO to start paying attention to Beijing and he is pushing for the alliance to take a tougher line.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "news and politics,summit,alliance,NATO,China,Joe Biden", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/biden-rallies-nato-against-systemic-china-threat-15014064", "Source": "google"}
