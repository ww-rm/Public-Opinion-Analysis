In hindsight, it was quite silly as I didn't realise all the confusion that can get caused due to this. Apologies,\" he added.\rEven Anand tweeted Kamath's statement and added he just played the position on the board and expected the same from everyone. \"Yesterday was a celebrity simul for people to raise money It was a fun experience upholding the ethics of the game.
