My 2 kids were in the living room and were startled to see me covered in blood,” he added.Mr Alex noted that his other neighbour intervened and quickly stopped the assailant from attacking him.“My helpful neighbour lay me down as I was feeling unconscious but I was very worried for the safety of my 2 kids as the main door was unlocked. Thankfully my helpful neighbour was keeping an eye on the assailant,” he noted.Following the incident, the police told Mothership that a 65-year-old man has been arrested for “voluntarily causing hurt with a dangerous weapon” and it is currently under police investigation.The police said it was alerted about the incident at 10.26am on Saturday at Block 130 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3.“A 47-year-old man had sustained a laceration on his head, and was conscious when conveyed to the hospital,” it noted.While many netizens expressed their wishes for Mr Alex’s speedy recovery under the comment section of his post, several Facebook users seem to question the assailant’s side of the story and what triggered him to assault Mr Alex in the first place.However, many netizens pointed out that the neighbour should not use violence against Mr Alex nonetheless, as causing injury to others is wrong unless if it was for self-defence.  © 2006 - 2021 The Online Citizen© 2006 - 2021 The Online Citizen", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2021/06/14/47y-o-man-allegedly-attacked-by-neighbour-with-bike-chain-for-placing-bicycle-by-the-corridor/", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
