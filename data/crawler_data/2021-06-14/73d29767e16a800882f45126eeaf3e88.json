Activist group Student Politicism said two of its leaders were arrested.There was no sign of any protests on Sunday.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "Hong Kong,protest", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/hong-kong-anniversary-democracy-protest-2019-arrest-15005144", "Source": "google"}
