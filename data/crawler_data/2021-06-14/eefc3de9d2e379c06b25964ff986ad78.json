Al-Masfuiin, posing as the boyfriend, then performed a sexual act on the boy in exchange for a night's lodging in the unit.

Still posing as a female, the accused told the victim that he could stay at 'her boyfriend's place' and that 'he'll send a Grab to let you stay over'.\"Believing that the accused was a female, the victim asked if the accused was joining the sex session. The accused, still posing as a female, replied that 'she' 'might not', 'but my (boyfriend) will tell me if you did a great job at sex'.\"The teenager arrived at the Tampines flat at around 1.20am on June 18 and Al-Masfuiin performed oral sex on him.The boy later fell asleep in the unit and Al-Masfuiin gave him the $50 note after he woke up that morning.
