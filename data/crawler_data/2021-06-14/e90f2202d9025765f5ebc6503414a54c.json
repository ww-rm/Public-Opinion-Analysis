In about six months, over 1.5 billion people have been vaccinated under close observation,\" added Prof Ooi.He said it is unclear why young men may be more susceptible, and that it is difficult to conduct the necessary studies to determine a correlation.\"Nonetheless, we can expect more detailed description of what happens to these cases in the coming months, from those that have been treated in the US and Israel. The picture may become clearer then.\"Get The New Paper on your phone with the free TNP app. Download from the Apple App StoreÂ or Google Play Store now", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/heart-inflammation-after-covid-19-jab-rare-experts", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
