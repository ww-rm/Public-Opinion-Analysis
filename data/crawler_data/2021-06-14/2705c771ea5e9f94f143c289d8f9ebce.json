It said a survey it conducted found that 50 per cent of drivers want lower service fees for better earnings.Gojek will also introduce a payout of $3 to drivers who have to drive 3km or more to pick-up their passenger, among other measures.Its general manager, Mr Lien Choong Luen, said: \"The ongoing impact of the pandemic is a consistent worry for our driver-partners as they try to sustain their earnings amidst the uncertainty.\"These measures will have a profound impact on the livelihoods of our driver-partners, increasing their take-home earnings while giving them more flexibility by reducing their dependence on incentives.\"Gojek said the changes reflect a significant investment in Singapore, as it seeks to grow its market share here.It also said that a recent campaign to provide free or discounted rides to and from vaccination sites for all riders in Singapore has registered 117,500 rides so far.Several drivers have been calling for ride-hailing operators to cut their commissions to help drivers tide over the impact of the pandemic.While Grab has not announced a cut of its 20 per cent commission rate, it said last month that it will permanently raise fares by $1 from this month to improve driver earnings amid rising fuel and maintenance costs.It will not collect commission on the additional $1 from June 1 to June 30. This means drivers will get $1 more for every ride they complete with Grab for a month.Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.SPH Digital News / Copyright Â© 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
