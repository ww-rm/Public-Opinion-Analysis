The other two are a man and a woman both aged above 40.The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) said most of the cases had occurred within a few days after receiving the second dose of the vaccine, and that all have recovered or been discharged well from hospital.Current data suggests that there is a very small risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after receiving a second dose of mRNA Covid-19 vaccine, particularly in males under 30 years old.But the authorities and experts have both said that such cases are extremely rare and it remains unclear if the vaccines are responsible for them.As a precaution, experts have advised that vaccinated people, especially adolescents and younger men, should avoid strenuous physical activity for one week after their second dose.The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, the two used in Singapore's national inoculation programme, are mRNA vaccines.The United States and Israel - two major users of the mRNA vaccines - have also reported a slightly increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis in young men after the second dose of mRNA vaccination.The three medical bodies on Monday acknowledged that these two countries have observed increased risk of such heart conditions, but noted that the sample size of Singapore is too small to be conclusive.They added that they are monitoring the situation closely and will advise should there be updates.Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.SPH Digital News / Copyright Â© 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
