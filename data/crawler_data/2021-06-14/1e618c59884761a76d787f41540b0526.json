She is charged with owning unlicensed walkie-talkies and violating Covid restrictions. Later trials will focus on allegations of corruption and breaking the official secrets act. Human rights groups have condemned the trial, describing it as an attempt to stop her running in future elections. Ms Suu Kyi, 75, has been held under house arrest since the 1 February coup in Myanmar (also called Burma), and little has been seen or heard of her apart from her brief court appearances. On Monday, Ms Suu Kyi's lawyers, who have met her only twice since she was detained, will cross-examine witnesses over the claims. Another trial will begin on 15 June over sedition charges. If convicted of that charge alone, she faces up to 14 years in prison. Last week, she was handed additional corruption charges over allegations that she illegally accepted $600,000 (Â£425,000) in cash and around 11 kilos of gold.\"There is an undeniable political background to keep her out of the scene of the country and to smear her prestige,\" her lawyer Khin Maung Zaw told AFP last week. \"That's one of the reasons to charge her - to keep her out of the scene.\"The military has justified seizing power in February, alleging voter fraud in general elections held last year. But independent election monitors say the election was largely free and fair, and the charges against Ms Suu Kyi have been widely criticised as politically motivated.The coup triggered widespread demonstrations, and Myanmar's military has brutally cracked down on pro-democracy protesters, activists and journalists. On Monday, a US journalist detained in Myanmar since March was released after charges against him were dropped. Nathan Maung is due to fly out of Myanmar on Tuesday, according to his lawyers. Security forces have killed more than 800 people and detained nearly 5,000 to date, according to the monitoring group Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP).Myanmar coup: What is happening and why?The embattled town that stood up to Myanmar's armyStreet tales from Myanmar: 'Take care of our baby if I die'Nato warns of military challenge posed by ChinaA summit of alliance leaders in Brussels describes China's behaviour as a \"systemic challenge\".Lockdown easing in England delayed to 19 JulyWhat Putin really wants from BidenWhat Putin really wants from BidenHow Chinaâs youth are shunning the rat race'We make it or we die' Video'We make it or we die'Netanyahu: A shrewd leader who reshaped IsraelâMy little girls donât know their mum died of CovidâTech firms use remote monitoring to help honey beesWhat happened when the Soviets tried to dig to the centre of the Earth?How Islamic State has expanded into Central AfricaFormer farmer, 84, is accidental ASMR YouTube star.
