Check out the latest gossip below, and see all official deals here.AS says that Arsenal have turned their attention to Real Betis attacking midfielder Nabil Fekir, but negotiations over a transfer fee are not close to the La Liga club's demands.The former Lyon captain was left out of Didier Deschamps' 26-man France squad for this summer's European Championships but, despite a mixed campaign last season, the Spanish club consider the 27-year-old to be one of their best players after contributing to 10 goals in La Liga. And the stance is that Betis have no intention of letting their playmaker leave for a low price.Fekir was close to joining the Premier League in 2018 after a move to Liverpool broke down at the 11th hour. But if any deal is to take place this time, Arsenal must be prepared to raise their initial offer, which is reported to be around Â£20m.The news comes as Mikel Arteta's side continue their search for an attacking midfielder after recently missing out on Emi Buendia, who was linked to the Emirates before agreeing a Â£33m deal with Aston Villa.
