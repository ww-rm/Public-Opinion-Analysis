The Canadians were separately beheaded by their Abu Sayyaf captors, including Mujir Yadah, a brother of Injam, after a deadline for ransom payment lapsed, a military officer said.Another Abu Sayyaf militant killed in Sunday's firefight was Al Sawadjaan, a bomb-maker and would-be suicide bomber, according to Lieutenant Colonel Wilfredo Borgonia, an army infantry battalion commander.Troops seized a rifle, a pistol, bomb parts and 15 cellphones. They also took into custody Yadah's wife and three children, the military said in a statement, adding the children were “rescued”.Sawadjaan was a younger brother of Abu Sayyaf commander Mundi Sawadjaan, the main suspect in a number of deadly suicide attacks in recent years in Sulu, a predominantly Muslim province where the militants have been the target of years-long military offensives.The Sawadjaans belonged to an Abu Sayyaf faction that has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group.This year, at least 18 Abu Sayyaf militants have been killed, 17 captured while 86 others have surrendered in Sulu, the military said.The US and the Philippines have separately blacklisted the Abu Sayyaf as a terrorist organisation for deadly bombings, ransom kidnappings and beheadings.The brutal group has been considerably weakened by battle setbacks, surrenders and factionalism but remains a national security threat.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "Philippines,Abu Sayyaf", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/philippines-abu-sayyaf-militants-killed-jolo-15005790", "Source": "google"}
