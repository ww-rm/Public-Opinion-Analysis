Five of the community cases have already been placed on quarantine, while three were detected through surveillance. The remaining two community cases are unlinked. There are no new cases from the migrant worker dormitories.MOH also reported three imported cases, all of whom have been placed on Stay-Home Notice since their arrival in Singapore.Of the 13 new cases, seven are asymptomatic, and were detected from screening and surveillance, while six were symptomatic.Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased from 116 cases in the week before to 36 cases in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also fallen from 17 cases in the week before to 15 cases in the past week.The two unlinked cases are a 23-year-old fully vaccinated male India national who works as a nursing aide at All Saints Home (Hougang) and a 27-year-old male India national who works as an engineer at Ecoxplore. The latter case is the source of a new cluster named after his case number.There are four cases linked to the new cluster. They are:a 50-year-old Bangladeshi man who is employed by Theng Liang Lee Services as a conservancy worker at 115 Bukit Merah View Market & Food Centre.a 72-year-old Singaporean man who is fully vaccinated and works at a sundry shop at the location.a 67-year-old Singaporean woman who is fully vaccinated and a food stall vendor at the location.a 65-year-old Singaporean man who is fully vaccinated and a food stall vendor at the location.The food centre is closed to all members of the public for three days from Sunday to 15 June, as MOH's epidemiological investigations have found that there is likely ongoing transmission among individuals who work at the location.All staff and tenants who have been working at the location from 25 May have been placed on quarantine, and will be tested during quarantine. In order to disrupt any wider, undetected community transmission, MOH will conduct special testing operations for all staff and tenants who have been working in 116 Bukit Merah View from 25 May. MOH will also extend free COVID-19 testing to members of the public who had visited the shops at 115 and 116 Bukit Merah View between 25 May and 12 June.There are two new cases linked to the cluster, named after the case number of the 27-year-old male India national who works at Ecoxplore.They are a 19-year-old Singaporean woman who works as a warehouse assistant at DHL Express (Singapore) and a 39-year-old Singaporean woman who is employed by Cleen First Services as a cleaner at Emerald Park condominium. Both are household contacts and family members to each another. They are household contacts of the male India national.Two cases are linked and not part of a cluster. One of them is a 59-year-old Singaporean woman who works as a part-time cleaner at Crystal Lodge and is a close contact of a previous case. The other is a 66-year-old Singaporean man who is a retiree, and a family member of a previous case. Of the three imported cases, two are Singapore permanent residents who returned from India, and one is a work permit holder who arrived from Indonesia and is a foreign domestic worker.With 31 more patients discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities on Sunday, 61,869 cases – or 99.3 per cent of the total – have fully recovered from the infection.Most of the 130 hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while one of them is in critical condition in the intensive care unit.A total of 243 patients – with mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive – are isolated and cared for at community facilities.Apart from the 34 patients who have died from COVID-19 complications, 15 others who tested positive for the virus were determined to have died from unrelated causes, including three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and another four, whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease.Among the 80 confirmed cases reported from 7 to 13 June, 44 cases have tested positive for their serology tests, 27 have tested negative, and nine serology test results are pending.Stay in the know on-the-go: Join Yahoo Singapore's Telegram channel at http://t.me/YahooSingaporeMore Singapore stories:COVID: Social gathering size can increase to 5 per group from 14 June – MTFCOVID: Dine-in at F&B places can resume at max 5 per group from 21 JuneWork-from-home remains default arrangement in Singapore's Phase 3 (HA)4 COVID ART test kits on sale at 3 Singapore pharmacies from 16 June: MTFIt is compulsory to have your car insured in Singapore.
