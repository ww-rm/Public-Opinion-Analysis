If he could, he would probably charge her under every law available.”Human Rights Watch said the allegations were “bogus and politically motivated” with the intention of nullifying the NLD victory and preventing Aung San Suu Kyi from running for office again.“This trial is clearly the opening salvo in an overall strategy to neuter Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy party as a force that can challenge military rule in the future,” said Phil Robertson, the organisation’s deputy Asia director.Near-daily protests have rocked Myanmar since the generals’ February 1 putsch. A mass uprising has been met with a brutal military crackdown that has killed more than 850 civilians, according to a local monitoring group.Analysts say army chief Min Aung Hlaing determined to sideline hugely popular leader and reshape political landscape.Since the military coup, an anti-military movement has grown to include fighting for ethnic minority rights.Save the Children says 103 schools and other education facilities attacked in May as coup-triggered chaos continues.Follow Al Jazeera English:", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/14/trial-of-myanmars-suu-kyi-gets", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
