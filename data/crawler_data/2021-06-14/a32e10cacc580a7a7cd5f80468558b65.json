However several EU member states have stopped administering it to people below a certain age, usually ranging from 50 to 65, restricting its use to older people, due to very rare cases of blood clotting, mainly among young people.On Sunday evening, La Stampa changed the headline on its article online and added a clarification with Dr Cavaleri's later comments to its article. La Stampa editor Massimo Giannini said he had no further comment.Earlier this week, the Italian government said it would restrict the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine to people aged over 60, after a teenager who had received the shot died from a rare form of blood clotting.Italian Health Minister Roberto Speranza told reporters on Sunday that Italy will continue to use the AstraZeneca vaccine on the over 60s, including on those who have not received a first shot.Like many European countries, Italy briefly halted AstraZeneca inoculations in March over concerns about the very rare blood clotting problems. It resumed them the following month with the recommendation that the product be \"preferably\" used for people over the age of 60, after the EMA said its benefits outweighed any risks.Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
