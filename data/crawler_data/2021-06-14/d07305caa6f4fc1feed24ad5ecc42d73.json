But Britain and Germany were notable holdouts on that.Campaigners also complained the G7 had failed to flesh out how it will pay for a newly agreed \"Nature Compact\" - to protect 30 per cent of the world's land and oceans from despoliation by 2030.The leaders committed to nearly halve their carbon emissions by 2030, relative to 2010, and to phase out the use of \"unabated coal\" - fuel whose emissions have not gone through any filtering - \"as soon as possible\".They vowed to end most government support for the fossil fuel sector overseas, and to phase out petrol and diesel cars.The G7 had sharp words for Beijing and Moscow, in the build-up to a NATO summit in Brussels on Monday and Biden's first sit-down with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Switzerland on Wednesday.They demanded China end abuses including forced labour in Xinjiang, where activists say up to 1 million people from Uyghur and other Muslim minorities are interned in camps, and in Hong Kong.And they pressed China to let experts from the World Health Organization (WHO) investigate further how COVID-19 first emerged, amid suspicions that the coronavirus may have escaped from a Chinese laboratory.The allies adopted a US initiative to counter China in infrastructure funding for poorer nations, promising to \"collectively catalyse\" hundreds of billions of investment.TheBuild Back Better World (B3W)project is aimed squarely at competing with Beijing's trillion-dollar Belt and Road infrastructure initiative, which has been widely criticised for saddling small countries with unmanageable debt.And the G7 demanded that Russia \"credibly explain\" the use of chemical agents on its soil, end its \"systematic crackdown\" on opposition groups and media, and \"hold to account\" criminals waging ransomware attacks.ROYAL BLESSINGA lingering row between Britain and the European Union over post-Brexit trading arrangements in Northern Ireland hung over the talks.But London sought to bring all sides together using the \"soft power\" diplomacy of Queen Elizabeth II and her heir Prince Charles, at a Friday night reception for leaders and EU chiefs.Joined on Saturday by counterparts from Australia, South Africa and South Korea - with India also taking part remotely - they then enjoyed an evening beach barbecue around fire pits, featuring a sea shanty band and toasted marshmallows.Downloadour appor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna.asia/telegramIt looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "COVID-19,coronavirus,vaccine,G7", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/g7-donate-1-billion-covid-19-vaccines-climate-change-china-15005514", "Source": "google"}
