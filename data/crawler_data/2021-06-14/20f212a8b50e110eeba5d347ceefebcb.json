What kind of option is that?\"After a long suspension, the game resumed at 8.30pm and the Finns went on to win 1-0 but Peter Schmeichel, who was part of the Danish side that won the Euros in stunning fashion in 1992, would have preferred to see it called off.\"There is no way that game should have been played last night. Not one player on that pitch was in the right mindset to be playing a game of football,\" he said.His sentiments were echoed by Laudrup, widely considered to be one of the greatest players ever to play for Denmark.\"When such things happen, you are in the throes of your emotions, and you do not have the capacity and oversight to make important decisions. There must be someone who says 'now we're going to do this, and now we stop here',\" he told Denmark's TV3.\"They were given a choice that is not a choice - play tonight, or play tomorrow at 12. I think that, I'm sorry, but that is not a choice,\" Laudrup said.The Danish Football Association said on Sunday that the 29-year-old Eriksen was in a stable condition in a nearby hospital, where further tests were being carried out to establish the cause of his collapse.Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.SPH Digital News / Copyright Â© 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
