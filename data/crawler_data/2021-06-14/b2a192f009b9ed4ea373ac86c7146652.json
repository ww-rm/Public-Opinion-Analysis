Let's talk about him a lot today.\"Lee then retorted: \"You didn't say anything while we weren't recording, but as soon as the cameras turned on, you came out with that line ready.\"Another cast member, Yoo Jae-suk, said jokingly: \"You should rethink your decision. If you say right now, 'I'm sorry', viewers would understand. They'd think, 'that rascal', laugh and move on.\"He later added more seriously: \"It will feel empty without you, but you should do all the things that you wanted to do now without worrying about us.\"Singer Kim Jong-kook, who has also been with the show from the start, said: \"It felt like we would go on like this forever without changing. The regret is even stronger because it's Kwang-soo, with whom I thought I would go until the end.\"Even though we aren't able to go on with Running Man together anymore, let's go for the rest of our lives together.\"[[nid:527050]]Those who had worked with him behind the scenes also shared their fond memories of him on social media.Former producer-director Lee Hwan-jin posted on Instagram on Sunday: \"From what I remember, Kwang-soo never once told the producers 'no'.\"From continuing to film even when he had a broken toe to being soaked with water in the middle of winter while suffering from a cold, his dedication was noted by his co-workers over the course of filming 559 episodes.Another former producer-director Jung Chul-min wrote: \"He always thought about the programme and his career rather than himself and showed such professionalism.\"This article was first published in The Straits Times.Â Permission required for reproduction.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.asiaone.com/entertainment/lee-kwang-soo-his-final-episode-running-man-thank-you-running-me-11-years", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
