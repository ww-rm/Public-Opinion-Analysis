You do not get to turn this into a White Saviour narrative. This is not yours,” he tweeted.The attacker, Australian self-declared white supremacist Brenton Tarrant, was jailed for life without parole last year, the first time a whole-of-life term has been imposed in New Zealand.— AFP © 2006 - 2021 The Online Citizen© 2006 - 2021 The Online Citizen", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2021/06/14/new-zealands-jacinda-ardern-pans-mosque-attacks-film-amid-backlash/", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
