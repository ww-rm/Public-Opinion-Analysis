The owner of the workshop did not proceed with the repairs because Sy had not provided a police report detailing the accident.A splatter of Ms Ocampo's blood and shreds of her clothing were found on the car, which was severely damaged with a cracked front windscreen and a broken bonnet, bumper and headlamp.The court heard that Sy had been drinking beer mixed with cognac for several hours before the crash and slept very little. But he decided to take his female friend, identified as one \"Alicia\", out for a meal at a McDonald's outlet in Ang Mo Kio and drove her home at about 5.35am despite being sleepy and intoxicated.The prosecution had urged the court to jail Sy for seven years and disqualify him from holding all classes of driving licences for at least 10 years after his release.Sy was granted bail of $20,000 to settle his personal affairs and to have a meal with his family once Covid-19 restrictions allow dining in at eateries.He is expected to surrender himself on June 22.For killing Ms Ocampo, he could have been jailed for up to 10 years.For obstructing the course of justice, he could have been jailed for up to seven years or fined, or both.This article was first published in The Straits Times. Permission required for reproduction.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/driver-jailed-6-years-after-speeding-eyes-closed-crashing-maid-and-leaving-her-die", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
