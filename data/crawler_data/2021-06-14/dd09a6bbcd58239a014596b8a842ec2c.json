Japan started vaccinating its population in February like South Korea.While there has been a significant drop in new cases at nursing homes as many elderly have received vaccines, South Korea will only see a full-scale reduction in the number of local transmissions in September when over 70 per cent will have been inoculated, said Jeong.Downloadour appor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna.asia/telegramIt looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "COVID-19,South Korea,coronavirus", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/south-korea-eases-covid-19-restrictions-on-concerts--sports-games-15011700", "Source": "google"}
