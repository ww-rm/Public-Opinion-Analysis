It initially denied the camps existed, but has since said they are vocational centres and are designed to combat extremism. In late 2019, China said all people in the camps had \"graduated\".It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "G7,China,COVID-19,coronavirus,Uyghurs", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/g7-china-covid-19-origins-investigate-taiwan-hong-kong-xinjiang-15006734", "Source": "google"}
