The communique issued by the summit pledges to \"end the pandemic and prepare for the future by driving an intensified international effort, starting immediately, to vaccinate the world by getting as many safe vaccines to as many people as possible as fast as possible\". It also includes steps to tackle climate change, with leaders re-committing to the target of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 at the latest and pledging to eliminate most coal power. Mr Johnson rejected suggestions the vaccines pledge was a moral failure by the G7 as it was not enough to cover the needs of poorer countries.He referred to the the UK's involvement in the development of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\"Already of the 1.5 billion vaccines that have been distributed around the world, I think that people in this country should be very proud that half a billion of them are as a result of the actions taken by the UK government in doing that deal with the Oxford scientists and AstraZeneca to distribute it at cost,\" he said.He added that \"we are going flat out and we are producing vaccines as fast as we can, and distributing them as fast as we can\".The target to vaccinate the world by the end of next year would be met \"very largely thanks to the efforts of the countries who have come here today\", Mr Johnson said.The leaders slightly exceeded their target of donating a billion Covid vaccines to poorer countries within the next year, if funding for future doses is included alongside individual jabs. There was also a commitment to build the frameworks to prevent and fight future pandemics. Elsewhere in the 25-page communique, there were several references to China, which President Biden said was a change from previous meetings of the world's advanced economies. Pledges made this time included working together to respond to China's impact on world trade. On the recovery from Covid there was even a reference to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's trademark domestic policy - the need to reduce inequalities by \"levelling up\".Charities and campaigners issued statements calling out vague promises and missed opportunities, but Mr Johnson will feel that post-Brexit Britain has staged a diplomatic show that was both competent and confident.Mr Johnson also dismissed the suggestion that patents for vaccines should be waived in order to boost global supply, something which the US backed last month.He said he wanted to protect \"incentives for innovation\" while building up manufacturing capacity, especially in Africa.Elsewhere in their communique, G7 leaders also pledged to: The communique calls for a \"timely, transparent, expert-led, and science-based WHO-convened\" investigation into the origins of Covid-19.US President Joe Biden has previously said the US intelligence community is split on whether coronavirus came from human contact with an infected animal or from a lab accident - a theory rejected by China.Mr Johnson said \"the advice that we've had is it doesn't look as though this particular disease of zoonotic origin came from a lab\", but he added: \"Clearly anybody sensible would want to keep an open mind about that\".French President Emmanuel Macron said the international community needed clarity about the origins of the virus but said it was up to the WHO to investigate.With G7 countries accounting for 20% of carbon emissions, Mr Johnson said: \"We were clear this weekend that action needs to start with us.\"But pressed on the lack of binding agreements and timetables, the prime minister says he will not \"pretend our work is done\" and he will be \"on everybody's case\" to make further progress ahead of the COP26 summit in Scotland later this year.Kirsty McNeill from Crack the Crises, a coalition of charities and NGOs including Save the Children and Oxfam, said the G7 summit was a \"historic missed opportunity\" on Covid-19 and climate change.Leaders arrived \"with good intentions but without their cheque books\", she said.Joanna Rea, from Unicef UK, said the G7 pledge on vaccines was \"the beginning of the action required to end this pandemic\" but called for a \"rapid acceleration of dose sharing in the next three months to ensure millions of vaccines get to the people in countries who need them the most\".How significant are G7's climate pledges?G7 calls for access to famine-hit Ethiopian regionIn pictures: World leaders bask in Cornwall sun at G7 summitG7 pledges climate action but disappoints activistsNato warns of military challenge posed by ChinaA summit of alliance leaders in Brussels describes China's behaviour as a \"systemic challenge\".Lockdown easing in England delayed to 19 JulyWhat Putin really wants from BidenWhat Putin really wants from BidenHow Chinaâs youth are shunning the rat race'We make it or we die' Video'We make it or we die'Netanyahu: A shrewd leader who reshaped IsraelâMy little girls donât know their mum died of CovidâTech firms use remote monitoring to help honey beesWhat happened when the Soviets tried to dig to the centre of the Earth?How Islamic State has expanded into Central AfricaFormer farmer, 84, is accidental ASMR YouTube star.
