You do not get to turn this into a White Saviour narrative. This is not yours,\" he tweeted.The attacker, Australian self-declared white supremacist Brenton Tarrant, was jailed for life without parole last year, the first time a whole-of-life term has been imposed in New Zealand.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "New Zealand,Jacinda Ardern,Christchurch", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/new-zealand-s-ardern-pans-christchurch-mosque-attacks-film-amid-15009772", "Source": "google"}
