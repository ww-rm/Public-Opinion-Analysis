Gonzales said that they went into the area to serve a warrant to Yadah at his house but were met with gunfire.They also recovered a M653 carbine rifle, a.45 calibre pistol, improvised explosive device components and 15 mobile phones.Yadah, who has also been involved in beheadings, has long been hunted by the Philippines military.He was a key player in the kidnap of five Indonesian nationals taken from Malaysian waters in January 2020. The kidnap victims were rescued in Tawi-Tawi earlier this year.\nTags / Keywords:\nAbu Sayyaf\n                                                                ,\n                                                                                                Injam Yadah\n                                                                ,\n                                                                                                Philippines\n                                                                ,\n                                                                                                cross-border kidnapping\n\n\n\nReport it to us.Thank you for your report!Copyright © 1995-\n            \n\n Star Media Group Berhad (10894D)Best viewed on Chrome browsers.{{item['V1 Header']}}\n   {{item['V1 Body']}}\n\n  {{item['V2 Header']}}\n\n", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2021/06/13/abu-sayyaf-commander-linked-to-sabah-kidnappings-killed-by-philippines-forces", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
