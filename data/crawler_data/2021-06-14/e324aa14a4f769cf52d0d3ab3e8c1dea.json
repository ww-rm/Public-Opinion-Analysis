Organisers were originally planning to feed residents of the village in vast dining halls â€“ the largest one with a capacity to seat 4,500 people at once.But now, the organisers will ask athletes to dine alone, maintain social distancing with others, and wipe down surfaces after eating.\"Without the proper measures in place, it will only take one person to bring in the virus and spread it, especially in places like the athlete village,\" Nobuhiko Okabe, one of the infectious disease specialists advising Tokyo 2020 on its coronavirus measures said at a news conference on Friday.\"We have to do what we can to make sure an outbreak doesn't happen, and we really need the cooperation of all the athletes and delegations to make this work,\" he added.(Reporting by Sakura Murakami; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "Olympics,medical health,AIDS,Olympic,condom", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/olympics---take-your-condoms-home--social-distancing-and-sex-in-the-olympic-village-15010206", "Source": "google"}
