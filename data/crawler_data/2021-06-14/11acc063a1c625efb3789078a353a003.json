As he did that, Craig got a hold of Hill’s arm between his legs.As he flipped Hill around, Craig completely snapped the lower half of Hill’s arm out of the socket, making for a wild scene. At one point, HIll’s arm was just dangling and flopping around in the hold before the referee stopped the fight.Craig actually said he could feel Hill’s arm pop as it went, too. After he made the move, Craig then looked up at the referee, Al Guinee, and seemingly questioned why they were still fighting, given how clearly injured Hill was.The fight was then called shortly after, which marked Hill’s first career loss and Craig's fourth straight victory. Craig was a +225 underdog to win the bout on BetMGM. Guinee, per MMA Fighting, is not working any other fight on Saturday night. Hill seemed to be handling it well, but his arm did not look great as he walked off the arena floor. UFC president Dana White told the broadcast team later in the night that Hill's arm did not break, but was just severely dislocated.Naturally, the method of victory sent plenty of fans rushing to Twitter. Many felt the fight was allowed to go on for too long after seeing Hill’s arm flapping around.More from Yahoo Sports:Denmark’s Eriksen given CPR after collapsing at Euro 2020Unseeded Krejcikova wins first Grand Slam title at French Open Wetzel: Michigan legend Bo Schembechler nothing but a fraudHaynes: Nuggets have been all talk falling into 3-0 hole vs. SunsIt is compulsory to have your car insured in Singapore.
