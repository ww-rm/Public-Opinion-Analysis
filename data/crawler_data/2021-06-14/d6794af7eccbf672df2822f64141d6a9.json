Taiwan is not a member due to Chinese objections, which considers it merely one of its provinces with no right to the trappings of a state.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "G7,Taiwan", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/taiwan-force-for-good-unprecedented-g7-support-china-15010136", "Source": "google"}
