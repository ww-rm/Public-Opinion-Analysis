They struggled to contain the omnipotent threat posed by Sterling, Phillips as well as second-half substitutes Marcus Rashford and Jude Bellingham.Southgate's willingness to trust his instincts has further shifted the perception of the Englishman, who has made the job his own these past 4½ years.Before last night, no England manager had the presence of mind to field a starting line-up devoid of Liverpool or Manchester United players at a major tournament, since the Euro 1992 clash against against France.Refusing to pander solely to representatives of the English Premier League's traditional Big Six is an indication of Southgate's willingness to place his hopes in the new brightest and best.That should mean more minutes for the likes of Phillips, Aston Villa's Tyrone Mings - the first Villan to start for England at the Euros since Southgate himself played against Germany in 1996 - and West Ham United midfielder Declan Rice.Full-throated renditions of \"Football's Coming Home\" at the final whistle may still be somewhat premature but England have never been in a stronger position to deliver.Get The New Paper on your phone with the free TNP app. Download from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store now", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.tnp.sg/sports/football/englands-bold-choices-pay-richard-buxton", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
