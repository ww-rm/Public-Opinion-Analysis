Manager Gareth Southgate, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and leading football figures had appealed for a stop to that.Once again, there was some jeering from a small section as players briefly went down on one knee, but many others among the 25,000 crowd in a sun-kissed Wembley began applauding and cheering.The gesture, borrowed from American NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick and popularised by the Black Lives Matter movement last year, has generated off-field controversy around Europe in the build-up to the 24-nation Euros.Critics view it as an unwanted politicization of sport and expression of sympathy with far-left politics.But England players and other national teams also taking the knee say it is simply a show of solidarity against racial discrimination still prevalent in football and around the world.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "knee,sports,England,Wembley", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/football-cheers-drown-out-boos-as-england-take-the-knee-at-15006592", "Source": "google"}
