Let's talk about him a lot today.\"Lee then retorted: \"You didn't say anything while we weren't recording, but as soon as the cameras turned on, you came out with that line ready.\"Another cast member, Yoo Jae-suk, said jokingly: \"You should rethink your decision. If you say right now, 'I'm sorry', viewers would understand. They'd think, 'that rascal', laugh and move on.\"He later added more seriously: \"It will feel empty without you, but you should do all the things that you wanted to do now without worrying about us.\"Singer Kim Jong-kook, who has also been with the show from the start, said: \"It felt like we would go on like this forever without changing. The regret is even stronger because it's Kwang-soo, with whom I thought I would go until the end.\"Even though we aren't able to go on with Running Man together anymore, let's go for the rest of our lives together.\"Those who had worked with him behind the scenes also shared their fond memories of him on social media.Former producer-director Lee Hwan-jin posted on Instagram on Sunday: \"From what I remember, Kwang-soo never once told the producers 'no'.\"From continuing to film even when he had a broken toe to being soaked with water in the middle of winter while suffering from a cold, his dedication was noted by his co-workers over the course of filming 559 episodes.Another former producer-director Jung Chul-min wrote: \"He always thought about the programme and his career rather than himself and showed such professionalism.\"Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.SPH Digital News / Copyright Â© 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
