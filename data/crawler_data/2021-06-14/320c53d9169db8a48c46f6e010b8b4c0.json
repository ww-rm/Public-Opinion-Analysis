I’m sad these stories were ever necessary, but I hope they made a difference,\" he tweeted.He also said that he was grateful to “around 300 sources who took time to share their expertise with (him) during a year when we all had little time to spare”.Yong added that he will be splitting the US$15,000 prize money between the people who worked on his stories in 2020, including editors, fact checkers and artists.“I could not have done this without the amazing people at the Atlantic, who collectively created an environment where award-winning work was possible,” he said.“Even when individuals win Pulitzers, their work depends on a community. I want to honour mine.”According to the Pulitzer Prize website, the award for explanatory reporting recognises “a distinguished example of explanatory reporting that illuminates a significant and complex subject, demonstrating mastery of the subject, lucid writing and clear presentation, using any available journalistic tool”.Yong has also written for publications such as National Geographic, the New Yorker, the New York Times and Scientific American.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "Pulitzer Prize,COVID-19,journalism,Malaysia,US", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/atlantic-journalist-ed-yong-wins-pulitzer-prize-covid-19-15010780", "Source": "google"}
