The penalty he converted to put Portugal 2-0 up in the 87th minute ensured he became the first player in European Championship Finals history to reach 10 goals overall, and then 11 with an injury-time strike, overtaking Michel Platini's record of nine - all scored in the 1984 tournament.It had looked as though it was going to be a frustrating evening for the Juventus forward. He missed a glorious chance in the first half to open the scoring, with his team mates also lacking composure in front of goal.Jota has now scored one goal in his last 11 matches for club and country, and was replaced in the second half, with the effects of his injury-hit season clear for all to see.But after Portugal's fortunate opener six minutes from time, it was all about Ronaldo, who added a coolly taken third 177 seconds after firing home from the penalty spot.The way in which he remained calm before rounding the goalkeeper for his second of the night proved that even when not at his best, his potency in front of goal, when it matters, remains as lethal as ever.That is now 106 international goals for the veteran, three off the all-time record set by Iran's Ali Daei.The desire for more goals and records remains stronger than ever. After this imposing start to the tournament, few would bet against Ronaldo surpassing Daei and adding one more accolade to his ever-growing list before Euro 2020 is out.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "sports,Hungary,Cristiano Ronaldo,Portugal,Euro 2020", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/euro-2020-doubts-over-ronaldo-dispelled-portugal-hungary-15022210", "Source": "google"}
