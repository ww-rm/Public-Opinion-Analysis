This figure could hit double-digits by 2030, making related emissions a problem.In Singapore, data centres accounted for 7 per cent of the country’s total electricity consumption last year. This is projected to reach 12 per cent by 2030, the universities’ press release said.With the industry being an “intensive” user of electricity and water, a “temporary pause” has since been imposed on the building of new data centres as local authorities mull a balance between environmental sustainability and supporting business needs.The Government has said it is in the midst of concluding its review and intends to share its plans with the industry later this year.NRF’s chief executive Low Teck Seng said the STDCT will help to accelerate the development and test-bedding of innovative and sustainable solutions for data centres towards commercial deployment.It will also support Singapore’s journey towards becoming a low-emissions economy as part of the foundation’s Energy Grid 2.0 programme, he added.The Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), which is supporting the research programme, said it will work closely with the industry to bring about more energy-efficient data centres and encourage the adoption of best-in-class technologies, solutions and standards.“This will enable us to grow our data centre ecosystem sustainably and further entrench Singapore as one of the world’s leading data centre hubs,” said cluster director for infrastructure planning and facilitation Yeo Tiong Yeow.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "data centre,sustainability", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/stdct-nus-ntu-test-cooling-solutions-data-centres-sustainability-15024092", "Source": "google"}
