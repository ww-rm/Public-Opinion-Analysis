Overseas spectators have already been banned.The Olympic decision is expected only after the virus emergency in Tokyo ends on June 20 and the government clarifies what measures will replace it.Recent reports have said the government could introduce \"quasi-emergency\" measures including restrictions on the sale of alcohol or limited opening hours for bars and restaurants.Experts and officials have expressed concerns that huge crowds attending the Games could accelerate virus infections after the emergency ends.Japan has so far seen a comparatively small virus outbreak, with slightly more than 14,000 deaths despite avoiding harsh lockdowns.But its vaccination programme has moved slower than many other developed nations, with just over five percent of the population fully inoculated so far.Under the current state of emergency, spectators are capped at 5,000 people or 50 percent of a venue's capacity, whichever is smaller.The decision on Olympic fans is expected by the end of the month.CHON BURI: Pattaya City has registered with the Chulabhorn Royal Academy (CRA) and ordered 100,000 doses of Sinopharm vaccine, city manager Sonthaya Khunpluem said on Wednesday.The Tourism and Sports Ministry has proposed expanding the Phuket sandbox model of reopening to foreign tourists to Bangkok and several other tourist provinces.KHON KAEN: A farmer was electrocuted while putting up an electric fence to protect seedlings in his rice field on Tuesday night, and his son was also killed when he rushed to help him, police said.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/2133287/japan-weighing-10-000-spectator-cap-ahead-of-olympics-media", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
