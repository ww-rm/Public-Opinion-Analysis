Police have insisted that they conducted a comprehensive search.The 5ha resort is next to a patch of thick jungle and in the foothills of a mountain range.The teen had a condition known as holoprosencephaly, where the brain fails to develop normally. She had limited verbal communication and could only write a few words.She attended a school for young people with learning difficulties.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "Malaysia,Nora Quoirin", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/nora-quoirin-malaysian-court-overturns-misadventure-ruling-15026200", "Source": "google"}
