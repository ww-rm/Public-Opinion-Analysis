(I) am applying for all these charges to be dropped,\" she said.\"Due to all these cases in the past, I should be granted immunity as a citizen.\"Judge Wang replied that the earlier cases are not relevant to her current set of charges.[[nid:530394]]At an earlier hearing on May 25, the court ordered that Phoon be remanded at the Institute of Mental Health for two weeks for psychiatric assessment.Arguing against the order at the time, Phoon also said she was a former naval officer, with a history of good conduct.She added that she had returned from holiday and was unaware of the laws requiring her to wear a mask.She first appeared in court last year after she allegedly failed to wear a mask over her nose and mouth \"at all times\" at Newton hawker centre between 7.20pm and 8pm on May 8 during the circuit breaker period.She left Singapore for Britain soon after that alleged offence. She returned to Singapore on June 28 last year and had to serve a 14-day stay-home notice at MBS until July 12.The court earlier heard that she allegedly left her hotel room at MBS between 8.07pm and 8.23pm on June 28.[[nid:532027]]Phoon is said to have loitered around various places in the hotel and is accused of failing to wear a mask while doing so.Following this, she allegedly failed to wear a mask in public places on multiple occasions between Dec 2 last year and May 24 this year, at MBS and outside the State Courts building, as well as at Clarke Quay Central and Bras Basah Complex.She was arrested on May 25 this year.On Tuesday, her case was adjourned to July 6.
