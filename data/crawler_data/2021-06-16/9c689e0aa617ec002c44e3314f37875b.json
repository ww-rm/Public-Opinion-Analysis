She had limited verbal communication and could only write a few words.— AFP © 2006 - 2021 The Online Citizen© 2006 - 2021 The Online Citizen", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2021/06/16/malaysian-court-to-rule-on-challenge-by-french-irish-teens-family/", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
