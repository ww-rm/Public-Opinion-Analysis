An alarming number of survivors of digital sex crimes said they had considered suicide.\"The report, based on 38 interviews and an online survey, said sex crime prosecutions involving illegal filming rose 11-fold between 2008 and 2017, according to data from the Korean Institute of Criminology.South Korean President Moon Jae-in has called for police to investigate the growing number of sexual abuse claims, including recently among members of the military.Last year, police broke up an online network that lured dozens of women and underage girls into what authorities have called \"virtual enslavement\" by blackmailing them into sending increasingly degrading and sometimes violent sexual imagery of themselves.HRW said the government needs to do more by increasing legal penalties for convicted offenders, boosting the number of women among the police, prosecutors, and judges, and changing broader gender inequality that normalises the consumption of non-consensual images.In 2019, prosecutors dropped 43.5 per cent of digital sex crime cases compared to 27.7 per cent of homicide cases and 19 per cent of robbery cases, though the sex crime cases that were prosecuted usually ended in a conviction, the report said.Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.SPH Digital News / Copyright Â© 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
