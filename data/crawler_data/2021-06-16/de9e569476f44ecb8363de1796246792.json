He has also been ordered to pay his brother â¬60,000 ($73,000, Â£52,000) in compensation.Police arrived at the home in eastern Madrid in February 2019 after a friend raised concerns about the welfare of MarÃ­a Soledad GÃ³mez, who was in her 60s.During the trial, the court heard that SÃ¡nchez, then aged 26, had strangled his mother during a dispute. He then dismembered and ate parts of her body over the following two weeks, feeding some to his dog.Spanish media say he had been known to police because of violence against his mother and that he had breached a restraining order at the time of his arrest.Spanish man tried for 'killing and eating mother'Russian man charged with cannibalismSpain country profileBiden and Putin praise talks but discord remainsThe US and Russia agree to nuclear arms control talks but progress at the Geneva summit is limited.The long awaited handshake between Biden and Putin.
