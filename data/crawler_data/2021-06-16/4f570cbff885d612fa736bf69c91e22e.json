The historical trend towards the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation under the CPC [Communist Party of China] leadership is not to be stopped,” he said on Wednesday.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Co-organised by Beijing’s liaison office in Hong Kong and the state-owned Bauhinia Culture Holdings, the forum was attended by more than 100 guests from the city’s political and business sectors, as well as by local and overseas academics who joined via video link.Earlier this month, Liu said he would work with Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor to safeguard China’s sovereignty and security and to oppose external interference, during a 40-minute meeting with the city’s leader at Government House.China’s top legislative body imposed a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong last June, then followed it with a radical shake-up of the city’s electoral system earlier this year intended to ensure that “patriots” would dominate the legislature and other key political institutions.Liu on Wednesday said those two decisions had delivered “a major transformation from chaos to stability” in Hong Kong.“‘One country, two systems’ has entered another stage of enduring success,” he said, referring to the governing principle in the city.“At this historical juncture, the commissioner’s office will … stay true to our founding mission as we forge ahead. We will more vigorously oppose external interference, serve the [city’s] development and put people at the centre, and join hands with the Hong Kong community to take diplomatic work related to Hong Kong to new heights.”Liaison office deputy director Tan Tieniu, speaking at the same forum, said the security law and electoral overhaul had helped protect the city’s constitutional order, prosperity and stability.In her own speech, Lam said that even though Hong Kong had faced unprecedented challenges since the 2019 social unrest, the central government and Communist Party had stayed true to the original intent of one country, two systems.“Now that Hong Kong has been put back on its right course under the party’s declared institutional strength of one country, two systems, we should make our contribution to the Chinese dream by embracing patriotism, national pride, team spirit and hard work and putting the people’s interest first,” she added.More from South China Morning Post:Beijing’s new chief diplomat in Hong Kong says battle against ‘foreign forces’ his top priority, dubs 2019 protests a ‘colour revolution’Beijing’s anti-sanctions law will give US, others ‘a taste of their own medicine’, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam saysNational security law: Hong Kong, Beijing tell Britain to ‘abandon colonial nostalgia’ after report accuses authorities of stifling dissentThis article Beijing’s top diplomat in Hong Kong doubles down on warnings to ‘foreign forces’ in first public appearance first appeared on South China Morning PostFor the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app. Copyright 2021.For Yemeni fisherman Fares Abdulhakeem and his friends, the day was like any other as they headed out to sea to earn a living in the war-torn country -- until they hit the jackpot in the belly of a whale.If you’re a foodie that’s leaving the comforts of your home to try the hottest restaurant in town, here are the credit cards you should have in your wallet.
