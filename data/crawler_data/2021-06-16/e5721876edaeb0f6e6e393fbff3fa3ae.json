Now we must go on.\"Hungary's Szalai said the defeat \"is frustrating\" and that Portugal \"didn't work enough to score,\" while keeper Gulacsi believed they needed a little luck to score a goal.Also read: If you had invested Rs 25,000 in Bitcoin in 2015 this is how rich you would beHere's how much money Bill Gates makes per minuteHow much does Mark Zuckerberg spend on his security?Who is the secretive Bitcoin billionaire who invented Bitcoin?
