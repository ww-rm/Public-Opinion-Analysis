She had limited verbal communication and could only write a few words. - AFP \nTags / Keywords:\nCourts\n                                                                ,\n                                                                                                Seremban\n                                                                ,\n                                                                                                Nora Anne Quoirin\n                                                                ,\n                                                                                                decision\n                                                                ,\n                                                                                                inquest ruling\n                                                                ,\n                                                                                                open verdict\n                                                                ,\n                                                                                                French-Irish teenager\n\n\n\nReport it to us.Thank you for your report!Copyright © 1995-\n            \n\n Star Media Group Berhad (10894D)Best viewed on Chrome browsers.{{item['V1 Header']}}\n   {{item['V1 Body']}}\n\n  {{item['V2 Header']}}\n\nWe would love to keep you posted on the latest promotion.
