It was vital to win and start the tournament with confidence and now we want to keep on winning,\" said Ronaldo.Portugal coach Fernando Santos added: \"If we'd scored earlier it would have been easier for us. We missed a few chances then had some anxious moments but found our composure again and finished the game well.\"The two sides had drawn 3-3 in one of the best games of Euro 2016 and although there were fewer goals this time around the match was no less compelling as the vociferous locals filled the Puskas Arena to capacity.The action on the pitch mirrored the fervour in the stands as Portugal played with real intensity, playing a direct game and hitting their front three with quick, long passes.Diogo Jota had the first clear sight of goal when he thumped a shot which was parried by keeper Peter Gulacsi, incurring the wrath of a furious Ronaldo who was in a better place to shoot.RONALDO MISSRonaldo was left only blaming himself late in the first half though when he uncharacteristically missed the target from close range after an incisive cross from Bruno Fernandes.Striker Adam Szalai was Hungary's main threat, heading a free kick into the arms of Rui Patricio shortly before halftime then testing the keeper again early in the second half.Portugal's veteran defender Pepe nearly scored at the start of the second half but was thwarted by the ever-alert Gulacsi, who later turned away a strike from Fernandes.Hungary substitute Szabolcs Schon set the stadium alight in the 80th minute when his shot squirmed past Patricio but the linesman's flag was quickly raised to puncture the celebrations.Guerreiro soon brought the hosts more pain as his scuffed shot trickled into the far corner of the net off the foot of Hungary defender Willi Orban, who moments later fouled Rafa Silva to allow Ronaldo to score from the spot.Ronaldo then combined with Silva to calmly dance past Gulacsi and round off a day of records after also becoming the only player to feature in five European Championships and to play the most games at the finals.The noisy locals and a sizeable travelling Portugal support made for a raucous atmosphere barely seen at any football game since the novel coronavirus pandemic struck in March 2020 and forced matches behind closed doors.Hungary recorded the most deaths per capita in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University data, but football-mad Prime Minister Viktor Orban was intent on filling the shiny new stadium, which opened in 2019, as he seeks to boost his popularity ahead of next year's election.Orban, who was at the game, has channelled billions of euros in state funds to upgrade an ageing football infrastructure and incurred widespread criticism for prioritising football over healthcare funds, particularly as the pandemic raged.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "sports,Hungary,Cristiano Ronaldo,Portugal,Euro 2020", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/euro-2020-record-breaking-ronaldo-strikes-late-as-portugal-sink-15021762", "Source": "google"}
