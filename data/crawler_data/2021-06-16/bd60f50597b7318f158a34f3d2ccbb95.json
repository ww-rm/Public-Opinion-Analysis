Let's work together to keep the conversation civil.Now Reading: The recent surge in COVID-19 cases and with children being equally affected, parents are extremely worried about a possible third wave and how it will impact their kids. While many have claimed that children are the worst hit amongst the population, experts have denied these claims and said that the second wave has impacted everyone equally.In light of the increased rate of COVID-19 infection amongst kids and the unavailability of vaccines, parents have entered a state of panic and chaos regarding the safety of their children. The pediatrics association has come to the forefront and have advised parents to not be scared of the virus as it may not have any serious impact on kids.Earlier, AIIMS Director Dr. Randeep Guleria has also clarified and stated that while children will be impacted the most during the third COVID-19 wave, there has been no solid evidence to prove the same.The Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) has also said that although children remain prone to infection, it is “highly unlikely that the third wave will predominantly or exclusively affect children”. Additionally, there has been no evidence to suggest whether the children who contract COVID-19 will have any serious complications.Read more: COVID-19 third wave: Malnourished kids are at greater risk of infectionThe latest reports from The Lancet COVID-19 Commission India Task Force, which includes prominent paediatric experts from all across the country, states that there is no evidence to suggest that children will be worst hit by an anticipated third wave.The group of experts teamed together to find out a possible way to ensure the safety of the children against COVID-19. They were asked to evaluate the evidence and suggest practical clinical tools and strategies for providers and guidance to the policymakers and the public, so as to collectively protect the children during this crisis.Although the data was limited, it was found that the mortality rate amongst severe COVID-19 positive children below the age of 10 was 2.4 percent.Whereas 40 percent of the children who had succumbed to the disease had co-morbidities and 9 percent of all hospitalised COVID-positive children had severe symptoms. All the participating kids were below the age of 10.Globally, children constituted 1.3-3.2 percent of the total reported hospitalised cases. The mortality rate was also said to be \"significantly low\" amongst kids.Akin to adults and older adults, children also experience the various symptoms of COVID-19. Some of them are highly common and prevalent in all age groups. That said, fever, runny nose, fatigue, sore throat and cough may be some of the most common symptoms experienced by kids.Besides all other common and classic symptoms of COVID, recent reports have suggested an increase in the number of multisystem inflammatory syndrome cases in children (MIS-C) infected with COVID-19. Children with MIS-C condition have come up with severe inflammation in various organs of the body, including heart, lungs, blood vessels, kidneys, digestive system, brain, skin or eyes.Read more: Coronavirus in kids: Third wave dangerous for kids? Clearing some mythsAccording to the latest reports, children with a mild infection can be treated in home isolation, recommending symptomatic treatment with paracetamol. However, if the symptoms are life-threatening and continue to progress, it is crucial to seek medical help.If you believe COVID isn't impacting kids mentally and emotionally, then it is untrue. While unlike adults, children may lack the ability to express, they also bear the psychological ills of the pandemic. During such unpredictable times, where not only are children getting affected by the virus, many have lost one or both their parents to COVID-19. This has surely taken a grievous toll on children's psychology.The health experts have said, “It is imperative to recognise as a society that in our well-meaning attempt to protect our young ones from disease and keep them physically safe, we do not inadvertently impair their minds by curtailing access to expression for their inherent curiosity, creativity, and joy.\"Find out about the latest Lifestyle, Fashion & Beauty trends, Relationship tips & the buzz on Health & Food.Thanks for subscribing.Please Click Here to subscribe other newsletters that may interest you, and you'll always find stories you want to read in your inbox.A weekly guide to the biggest developments in health, medicine and wellbeing delivered to your inboxThank you for subscribing!\n\t        Your subscription is confirmed for news related to biggest developments in health, medicine and wellbeing.\n\t        Making mosquitoes fight mosquitoes to prevent dengueShould you buy cryptos?Why the Model Tenancy Act is the ‘Unlock’ India immediately needsOpinion: ‘Hey Ram’, ‘Et tu, Brute’ and a 56-inch mythA weekly guide to the biggest developments in health, medicine and wellbeing delivered to your inboxThank you for subscribing!\n\t        Your subscription is confirmed for news related to biggest developments in health, medicine and wellbeing.\n\t        ", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/parenting/toddler-year-and-beyond/coronavirus-in-kids-will-the-third-wave-of-covid-19-affect-children-more-heres-what-experts-have-to-say/photostory/83510968.cms", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
