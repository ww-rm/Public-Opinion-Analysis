Success, says the White House, would be simply managing to lower the temperature and forging a \"predictable, stable\" relationship.The US side is \"not expecting a big set of deliverables\", the senior Biden official said.The Swiss hosts, who are running a massive security operation during the summit, stressed the importance of the meeting.\"Switzerland is convinced that a constructive dialogue between the great powers is needed to face the challenges of our times,\" President Guy Parmelin told reporters after meeting Biden.After a year and a half of grappling with the devastating COVID-19 pandemic, the US and Russian leaders had the chance to \"inject a bit more optimism, a bit more hope into global politics\", he added.BACKED BY ALLIESBiden - flying into Geneva from Brussels after back-to-back summits with the EU, NATO and the G7 group of allies - meanwhile said he wants to establish clear \"red lines\" for what the White House will no longer tolerate.\"I'm not looking for conflict with Russia, but... we will respond if Russia continues its harmful activities,\" Biden said after his NATO meeting on Monday.In something of a pivot from his previous characterisation of Putin as a \"killer\", Biden upgraded the Russian leader to a \"tough\" and \"worthy adversary\".Going into the summit, Biden has emphasised that he has the backing of his Western partners.Russia was one of the top topics at the NATO summit in Brussels, where the defence alliance warned that Russian military build-ups on the edge of eastern Europe \"increasingly threaten the security of the Euro-Atlantic area and contribute to instability along NATO borders and beyond\".For all the bruising rhetoric, the White House is keen to emphasise that it wants to do business in a limited way with Russia. Officials point to the recent extension of the New START nuclear arms limitation treaty as an example of successful diplomacy.According to Ushakov, one possible baby step might be a quick reinstatement of the two countries' ambassadors, who returned home this year in response to tensions.Officials from the two sides say the leaders will initially meet with only translators and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.They will then switch to a larger format, with five officials accompanying each leader.However, unlike in 2018, when Biden's predecessor Donald Trump met Putin, there will be no joint press conference.The US side is clearly anxious to avoid the optics of having Biden sharing that kind of platform with the Russian president.In 2018, Trump caused a stir by saying, as Putin stood beside him, that he believed the Kremlin leader over his own intelligence services when it came to accusations of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election that brought Trump to power.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "Vladimir Putin,Joe Biden,news and politics,summit,US,Russia", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/biden--ready--for-putin-after-landing-in-geneva-15020934", "Source": "google"}
