At some stores, staff were seen dusting their display shelves and racks.But not all stores were ready to welcome customers by 11am. British luxury fashion house Burberry and Japanese department store Muji were among those that remained shuttered.In a circular to tenants on Wednesday, Ion Orchard said only shops whose staff have all been swabbed and tested negative are allowed to reopen.It added: \"You are expected to make the necessary arrangements to begin your operations and ensure the stores are manned accordingly.\"[[nid:530121]]Still, about a dozen shoppers were seen at the mall, including Ms Liyana Laily, 29, who works in quality assurance.She decided to pop by the mall as she was in the area. She was not aware that Ion Orchard had been closed for four days owing to Covid-19.\"But I'm not worried. Singapore has a certain standard of cleanliness and obviously they want business to come back, so they would put in effort to maintain that standard,\" she said.Another shopper who wanted to be known only as Mr Koda, 41, also dropped by the mall to buy a pair of shoes for his two-year-old son. He, too, was not concerned about the recent Covid-19 cases linked to the mall.\"If anything, this would be the cleanest place in Singapore after all that cleaning,\" said Mr Koda, who works in the energy sector.\"And Singapore does a good job of cleaning, so I'm not worried,\" he added.This article was first published in The Straits Times. Permission required for reproduction.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/blood-shattered-glass-one-store-first-day-ion-orchards-reopening", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
