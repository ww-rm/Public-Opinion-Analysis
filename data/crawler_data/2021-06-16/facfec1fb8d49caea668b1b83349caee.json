Nobody is going to make a final decision at this point. The JCVI will want to weigh up the benefits against the risks before vaccinating children, and it wants more data,\" a government source told the paper.JCVI and Britain's Department of Health and Social Care did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment outside business hours.The report also added that committee members are understood to have voiced ethical concerns about vaccinating children as they rarely suffer severe COVID-19.Earlier this month, Britain's medicines regulator extended approval of the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech for children aged 12 to 15 years.The regulator said it would now be up to JCVI to decide whether to go ahead and inoculate this age group as part of Britain's vaccination roll-out plan.Downloadour appor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna.asia/telegramIt looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "COVID-19,UK,children", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/uk-ministers-to-be-advised-against-mass-vaccination-for-children-15023280", "Source": "google"}
