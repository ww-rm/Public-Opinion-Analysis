Beijing says such doubts betray the \"imperial hangover\" of many Western powers that humiliated China for centuries.CHINA'S RISEThe re-emergence of China as a leading global power is considered to be one of the most significant geopolitical events of recent times, alongside the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union that ended the Cold War.China in 1979 had an economy that was smaller than Italy’s, but after opening to foreign investment and introducing market reforms, it has become the world’s second-largest economy and is a global leader in a range of new technologies.Leaders of the G7 - the United States, Canada, Britain, Germany, Italy, France and Japan - want to use their gathering in the seaside resort of Carbis Bay to show the world that the richest democracies can offer an alternative to China's growing clout.The US official said that until now, the West had failed to offer a positive alternative to the \"lack of transparency, poor environmental and labour standards, and coercive approach\" of the Chinese government that had left many countries worse off.According to a Refinitiv database, as of mid-last year, more than 2,600 projects at a cost of US$3.7 trillion were linked to the initiative, although the Chinese foreign ministry said last June that about 20 per cent of projects had been seriously affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.As part of the G7 plan, the United States will work with the US Congress to supplement existing development financing and to \"collectively catalyse hundreds of billions of dollars of infrastructure investment,\" the White House said.FORCED LABOURThe United States is pushing the other G7 leaders for \"concrete action on forced labour\" in China, and to include criticism of Beijing in their final communique from a three-day summit in southwest England, the US official said.Biden planned to press the other leaders to make clear that they believe forced labour practices are an affront to human dignity and \"an egregious example of China’s unfair economic competition\".\"We’re pushing on being specific on areas like Xinjiang where forced labour is taking place and where we have to express our values as a G7,\" the official said of the final communique to be issued at the end of the summit on Sunday.China denies all accusations of abuse in the Xinjiang region.The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the G7 infrastructure proposal or the US official's remarks about forced labour.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "G7,business and finance,China,belt and road", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/g7-counter-china-belt-and-road-infrastructure-project-biden-14999848", "Source": "google"}
