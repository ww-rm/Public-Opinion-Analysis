Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez headline an ensemble of the world’s top footballing talents as they strive to lead their respective countries to 2021 Copa America glory over the next four weeks. Read on to find out how to watch a Copa America 2021 live stream from anywhere.Dates: June 13 - July 11, 2021Free Copa America 2021 live stream: BBC iPlayer (UK)Global live streams: Fox Sports via FuboTV (US) | Optus Sport (AUS) | Univision (CAN) | Spark Sport (NZ)Watch anywhere: try ExpressVPN 100% risk-freePão e circo are the order of the day in Covid-crippled Brazil, which brushed aside international condemnation to accept hosting duties, after deadly political unrest and a worsening health crisis deemed Colombia and Argentina unsuitable. Football fans will be keeping their fingers crossed that off-field problems don't overshadow what should be a celebration of sport, but may end up as one of the most controversial events ever.In normal times, the Copa America is one of football’s most spectacular festivals and a tournament that’s been traditionally dominated by the big three: Uruguay (15 titles), Argentina (14) and Brazil (9). And like Euro 2020 on the other side of the Atlantic, it has been eagerly awaited.The Seleção are the defending champions, with Everton, Gabriel Jesus and Richarlison having fired Brazil to victory over Peru in the final two years ago.Incredibly, Messi has never lifted America’s Cup, having tasted defeat in three finals, the last of which pushed him to an early, albeit temporary, international retirement. Copa America has become an obsession for La Albiceleste, who haven’t won the tournament in 28 years.Here's how to live stream Copa America 2021 from anywhere - not forgetting how to watch every game of Copa America for FREE.There are loads of options for watching a free Copa America live stream. As usual, football fans in the UK are extremely lucky on this front, with all the games being shown by national broadcaster BBC on its free-to-watch  iPlayer streaming service.Elsewhere the likes of Televisión Pública in Argentina, SBT in Brazil, Canal 13 in Chile, and América Televisión in Peru will also be carrying some free coverage throughout the tournament.Scroll down for all the ways you can watch Copa America online in a number of countries around the world. But first, you should know that if you're abroad at any point during the tournament, you probably won't be able to watch the footy like you normally would at home.This is because of geo-blocking, a digital restriction that means certain streaming services are only accessible in the region they're based in. Don't sweat it, though, as you've got the option of using a VPN to tune to your preferred coverage wherever you are. Use a VPN to live stream Copa America 2021 from anywhereExpressVPN is the world's top VPN right now\nWe've taken the time to try out all the biggest VPN providers and we found ExpressVPN to be the best of the bunch. It works with lots of devices and offers super fast connections across its many servers. It's compatible with loads of devices including iOS, Android, Amazon Fire Stick, PlayStation, Apple TV and such, and we found it secure, speedy and simple-to-use.  Throw in its robust security features, and ExpressVPN is the best all-round VPN for streaming - and perhaps best of all, it has a 30-day money back guarantee plus 3 months FREE when you subscribe for a year.Once you've downloaded the software, just follow the prompts to install it then select the location you want to relocate your IP address to - it really is that easy.- Try ExpressVPN 100% risk-free for 30 daysRemember, there are loads of benefits to using a VPN beyond just helping you regain access to streaming services and content from abroad. One of the biggest is security: by using encrypted tunnels, VPNs give you a robust first-line of defense against cybercriminals and government snooping. This makes everyday tasks like online shopping and banking much safer, and many people choose to use one for that reason alone.The great news for football fans based in the UK is that you can watch Copa America FREE online for every single game of the tournament!If you're not in front of a TV, you can stream all of the action on BBC iPlayer. As a national broadcaster, it doesn't cost a penny to stream if you're located in the UK (though you should possess a valid TV licence).You can also watch every single match via the Red Button. Kick-off times vary, but all of the action takes place late at night, with the early games set to begin at 10pm BST, and the latest at 2am BST.Not in the UK for Copa America?

There are plenty of over-the-top TV streaming services you can use too. Of the many options, we think Sling TV is the best fit for most soccer fans' needs, with its Blue package offering Fox Sports. Sling Blue usually costs $35 per month, but new subscribers can get a fantastic bargain - right now you can save big bucks with this Sling TV deal, which lets you get a whole month of Sling Blue for $10.Another great option is fuboTV, an even more comprehensive streamer that also offers Fox Sports channels.
