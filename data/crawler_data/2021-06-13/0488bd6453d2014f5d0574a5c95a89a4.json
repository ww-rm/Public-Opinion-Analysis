When he advised them again, Idumehdrah suddenly turned aggressive.He told him \"go f*** off from here\" and told one of the ambassadors multiple times to \"f*** off\".He was openly aggressive towards the officer and the two ambassadors, and had to be held back by other members of the group. One of the ambassadors lodged a police report.The victims disengaged themselvesÂ from the group to prevent the matter from escalating further, but the group dispersed and left before the police arrived.For breaching a COVID-19 regulation, Idumehdrah could have been jailed up to six months, fined up to S$10,000, or both.For using abusive words on a public servant, he could have been jailed up to a year, fined up to S$5,000, or both.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "court,crime,COVID-19", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-phase-2-reopening-safe-distancing-newton-hawker-centre-14993282", "Source": "google"}
