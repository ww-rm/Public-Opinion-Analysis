There were 4,002 deaths.The South Asian country's total Covid-19 cases stands at 29.4 million, with 367,081 fatalities.During the second wave of the virus many people resorted to costly private treatment in what is still a low-income country.Others paid twenty times the usual price for oxygen cylinders on the black market and huge sums to secure ambulances and hearses.Experts have said millions of people remain vulnerable to new surges of infections, particularly in the countryside where two-thirds of the population lives.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said the government would take over the inoculation programme from Indian states and offer free doses to everyone over the age of 18.The government would allow private hospitals to have 25 per cent of all vaccine supplies, but not to charge more than 150 rupees (S$2.72) over the cost of the dose, he said.Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.SPH Digital News / Copyright Â© 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
