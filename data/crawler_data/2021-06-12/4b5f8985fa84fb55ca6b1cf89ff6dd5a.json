Yang told Blinken that Washington should handle Taiwan-related issues “carefully and appropriately,” CCTV reported.Washington should work with Beijing to put ties “back on track,” Yang said, according to CCTV.The US and China have been engaged in an increasingly tense diplomatic exchange since Blinken and Yang met face-to-face in Alaska in March. At the time, the US expressed “deep concerns” about actions by China, and China pushed back as “firmly opposed to US interference in China’s internal affairs”.Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at the German Marshall Fund think-tank, told Reuters that although the agenda included potential areas of cooperation, the conversation appeared dominated by contentious issues.She said Yang’s call for Washington to work with Beijing to put ties “back on track” indicated that China was still putting the onus on the US for the problems in the relationship.Notwithstanding the diplomatic tensions, China’s largest ride-hailing company, Didi Chuxing, filed on Thursday for an initial public offering of stock on US financial markets in what is expected to be the world’s biggest IPO this year, Reuters reported.The company is backed by Asia’s largest technology investment firms – SoftBank, Alibaba and Tencent. Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that it could raise around $10bn and seek a valuation of close to $100bn.At that valuation, Didi’s listing would be the biggest Chinese share offering in the US since Alibaba raised $25bn in 2014.Activists arrested and as many as 7,000 police to be deployed after annual vigil banned for a second year.Families fear that Australia is being too cautious on issue because of China’s economic might.Annual US human rights report takes China, Russia, Belarus to task over alleged rights abuses, cites Yemen violations.Human Rights Watch is the latest to document policies of mass detention, torture and cultural persecution in Xinjiang.Follow Al Jazeera English:", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/11/blinken-raises-us-concerns-over-xinjiang-hong-kong-with-china", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
