The emergence of new variants have also delayed efforts to flatten the infection curve, the Prime Minister's Office had said.On May 28, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin announced that the country would go intototal lockdownfor 14 days beginning Jun 1, with only essential economic and service sectors allowed to carry on with their operations.Case number breached the 9,000-mark on May 29, before the lockdown measures brought daily infections down gradually. On Friday, a total of 6,846 cases were reported.If the first phase of total lockdown could reduce the number of daily cases, then the country would ease into a four-week second phase, where more economic sectors would be allowed to reopen.Phase 3 would be similar to the movement control order (MCO) that has been enforced in the country, where nearly all economic sectors are allowed to operate with strict SOPs.The progression from one phase to another would be subject to the Ministry of Health's risk assessments.As of Friday, Malaysia's national COVID-19 tally stood at 646,411.Downloadour appor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna.asia/telegramIt looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "Malaysia,total lockdown,Ismail Sabri Yaakob,COVID-19", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid-19-malaysia-total-lockdown-extend-two-weeks-jun-15-jun-28-14993456", "Source": "google"}
