A lawsuit brought to establish an important legal principle or right. Such an action is frequently brought by the parties’ mutual consent on agreed facts – when that is so, a test case is also sometimes termed amicable action or amicable suit; or2. An action selected from several suits that are based on the same facts and evidence, raise the same question of law, and have a common plaintiff or a common defendant. Sometimes, when all parties agree, the court orders a consolidation and all parties are bound by the decision in the test case. – Also termed test action.In the present case, the action brought by the SBS Transit drivers to transfer the suit falls within the definition of a “test case”, as it fits the second definition stated above, said Justice Lim.She also rejected SBS Transit’s submission that a test case should, on top of the second definition above, include case management “or other concerns which would make the matter unsuitable for determination by the State Courts”.Referencing the Australian case cited by SBS Transit, Justice Lim said that unlike the relevant Australian provisions that contain guidelines on the Federal Magistrates Court’s discretion to transfer proceedings to a higher court, there are no such requirements in Section 54B(1) of the SCA in Singapore.“I add that such matters may, however, constitute relevant considerations under the second stage of the inquiry pertaining to the exercise of the court’s discretion whether to transfer even if one of the grounds in s.54B(1) is made out,” she added.Human rights lawyer Mr Ravi of K. K. Cheng Law LLC, who represents the drivers, dubbed the decision a “ground-breaking” one, as the High Court “acknowledged that there are important questions of law of public importance centring around the interpretation of provisions Employment Act”.Such questions, he said, “affect a larger class of employees and workers in general, and would have potential ramifications on how employment contracts are structured in terms of granting off days, computing overtime pay and determining work hours”.Mr Ravi also noted that he has decided to act for the drivers on a pro bono basis as they were “not able to keep up with their installment payments” for the “small fee” he had charged them.Mr Ravi’s team comprises himself, as well as his knowledge manager Guo Rendi, senior law researcher Gabriel Rafferty, and paralegal Sankari Loganathan.“At the same time during the pandemic came in more pro bono death penalty cases that needed urgent attention and Sankari ably handled the families and distraught mothers with her kind demeanour,” he said.“On the SBS case , my entire team were and are committed to sacrificing the extra hours which has now paved way for the determination of the ambit of certain provisions of the Employment Act, like the meaning of” rest days”,” overtime” etc. This case will effectively also determine the rights of about 6000 SBS drivers in Singapore,” Mr Ravi added.SBS Transit is represented by a team of five lawyers from Davinder Singh Chambers, led by Senior Counsel Davinder Singh.On 3 Mar last year, five bus drivers argued that by failing to compensate its bus drivers at the basic hourly rate of pay for their waiting time between shifts, SBS Transit had breached an implied term stated in their service agreement.The lawsuit arose after the two parties had failed to reach a settlement in their final mediation session between the first tranche of suits as reported in Feb last year.In a statement of claim filed in the State Courts that month, the bus drivers alleged that the company has breached several provisions under the EA — the statutory legislation upon which the terms and conditions pertaining to their working hours and overtime were based on.The bus drivers claimed that SBS Transit had failed to compensate them at the basic hourly rate of pay “for the period between 4 a.m. to 5 a.m. on the morning and split shifts” in which the drivers are “engaged to be waiting”, and “between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. on the split shift”.SBS Transit, they added, had also failed to abide by Clause 24(9) of the Service Agreement by not compensating them the agreed allowance of $18 for work done on the night shift.The company, they alleged, had also breached Section 36(1) of the EA by failing to provide on a roster a weekly rest day.In addition, the company had violated Section 37(3)(b) and Section 37(3)(c) of the EA by not paying them “the statutorily prescribed rate” of a sum at the basic rate of pay for two days’ worth of work, the bus drivers argued.By imposing a “Built-In Overtime” that resulted in the bus drivers working for longer than the statutorily prescribed daily work period of eight hours as well as 44 hours per week, SBS Transit had also breached Section 38(1) of the EA, according to the bus drivers.Other breaches under the EA allegedly made by SBS Transit, as claimed by the bus drivers, include compensating them at the normal hourly rate of pay — instead of the statutorily prescribed rate of an extra day’s salary at the basic rate of pay for one day’s work, in addition to the gross rate of pay for that day — for work done on public holidays.The five additional bus drivers bring the total number of bus drivers currently taking legal action against SBS Transit to 13. © 2006 - 2021 The Online Citizen© 2006 - 2021 The Online Citizen", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2021/06/10/high-court-grants-13-sbs-transit-bus-drivers-permission-to-transfer-case-from-state-courts-to-high-court-based-on-important-questions-of-law-regarding-employment-act-provisions/", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
