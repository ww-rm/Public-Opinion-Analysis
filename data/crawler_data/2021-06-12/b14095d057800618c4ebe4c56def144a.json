When all the preparations are ready, then we can start small with an air travel bubble to build confidence on both sides.\"Echoing PM Lee, Mr Morrison said that while there is some time before Singapore and Australia can open up the air travel bubble, the two countries are working on putting systems in place to do so.The leaders also acknowledged the importance of open borders to post-pandemic recovery.On students getting the first opportunity to travel, they said such a move could be a good opportunity to test the systems, before widening travel.Mr Morrison said: \"We really do want to focus on those students coming, as a first wave, a first tranche - as part of the exercise of piloting how these systems can work most effectively when we get to the next phase.\"PM Lee said he raised this matter with Mr Morrison specifically because \"quite a number\" of Singaporeans study in Australia and there is urgency for them to go back to school, especially for those who have secured clinical attachments or postings.Mr Morrison said Singapore is the first country outside of New Zealand that Australia would wish to engage in a travel bubble with.\"And we want to get it right in Singapore, which we know we can do because of the very sophisticated systems that Singapore has,\" he added.PM Lee noted that Australia and Singapore have similar approaches to keeping the virus out of their populations and keeping their people safe.Both countries also strongly supported each other during the early stages of the pandemic.Get The New Paper on your phone with the free TNP app. Download from the Apple App StoreÂ or Google Play Store now", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/singapore-and-australia-set-work-towards-travel-bubble", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
