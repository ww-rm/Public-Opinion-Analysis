Class participants may unmask if they are engaging in strenuous activities, although they are strongly encouraged to remain masked where possible to reduce the risk of transmission. Ken Mok, the CEO of True Group, shared with Yahoo Lifestyle SEA that he was happy to hear the news: \"We are happy and grateful that we can soon welcome our members back to our clubs with appropriate safe distancing measures in place. While we have been conducting online and outdoor classes that have been very well received, our members have been raring to return to their regular fitness sessions.\"Mok added that in line with safe management measures, their clubs are cleaned and sanitised every two hours: \"We are committed to doing our part in keeping Singapore safe, and we are waiting to hear from the authorities on the required testing regime. Prior to the recent closures, we clean and sanitise our clubs every two hours, which is above and beyond requirements. We will continue to do so, and take other active steps to ensure the safety of our team and members.\"As for Sarah Stuart, owner of the F45 Training Jurong CBD studio, she remains hopeful about the news.“We welcome the government’s decision to allow indoor activities to resume and are prepared to comply with safe-distancing guidelines to ensure our wider community, including staff and members, remain safe. As we await further details, we will continue to ensure contactless check-in at studios via our app, and ask all members to use our disinfection station upon entering the studio. Our format also allows for members to work at their own station with all the disinfected equipment they need to avoid sharing with any others,\" said Stuart.Brad Robinson, CEO of boutique gym chain Ritual Gym Singapore, said that his members are itching to get back to a regular fitness routine, which also means \"being able to use fitness equipment and not wearing a mask during exercise.\" “We are thrilled that restrictions are starting to ease, and that the national measures put in place proved to be effective. The national vaccination drive along with easier testing options should allow us to get back to business as usual in short to medium term, which is very exciting,” Robinson said upon hearing the positive news.Balancing the New Normal:SG Phase 2 Heightened Alert: 10 F&B outlets that deliver familiar comfort food to your homeSG Phase 2 Heightened Alert: 11 restaurants that deliver a touch of luxe to your doorstepIndonesian restaurant The Rice Table closing down after 24 yearsFoodies rally to patronise ailing elderly hawkers as diners asked to stay homeINTERVIEW: Royal Pek, co-founder of Xian Dan Chao Ren — 'I’ve sacrificed relationships with people I love'Watch more Yahoo Lifestyle videos on Yahoo TV:Assembly by Natasha Brown review – a modern Mrs DallowayA sparsely written debut about a black woman preparing for a party examines the disorienting experience of assimilation Virtuosic debut … Natasha Brown.

And in a joke we suspect a lot of people will agree with Maher said that Manchin is pretty much just a Republican. “The most powerful republican in the Senate” is how Maher put it. We hardly need to remind people of who Manchin is, but just to put the joke in context, he’s famous for his obstinate refusal to consider even tepid reform of the filibuster.

The celebrity chef, author and television host died by suicide three years ago, so it’s inevitable that a melancholy air suffuses what is nevertheless a warm celebration of an unusually full life. The effortlessly charismatic Bourdain never met a camera he couldn’t seduce, andThe Sanderson sisters are coming back!The movie “Asia,” written and directed by Ruthy Pribar, tells the story of a single mother named Asia (Alena Yiv) and her teenage daughter Vika (Shira Haas).

But what is interesting to see when the creative teams behind these projects get together is how this communal, challenging experience was tackled by them in very different ways — and yet they all can empathize with each other’s plights. “We were kind of fractured inThe title of this documentary about the making of the mid-90s exploitation picture “Kids” is a rebuke to the way that movie was perceived when it came out, as a truthful portrait of a lost generation devoted to sex and drugs. The survivors of that experience who are interviewed in “The Kids” make it clear that what got on the screen was actually the fantasy of the aggressive and manipulative Larry Clark, who was deep into middle age when he began hanging out with very young skaters around WashinMelissa Barrera and Leslie Grace scored the job of a lifetime when, after an audition process that lasted a year and a half, Lin-Manuel Miranda personally FaceTimed each of them to say they’d been cast in the film version of “In the Heights.” What came next was some of the most difficult choreography Barrera and Grace would have to execute in their careers.
