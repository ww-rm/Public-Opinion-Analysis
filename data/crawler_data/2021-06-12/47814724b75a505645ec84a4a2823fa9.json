Investigations are ongoing, the authority said.Manufacturers and repackers of surgical masks are licensed by HSA to ensure good quality and safety for use.In its release, the authority said surgical masks from unlicensed facilities have not been verified to meet the standards of quality, filtration capability and breathability.[[nid:487670]]\"Sub-standard masks may not provide the desirable level of protection to the wearer,\" it added, noting that masks made, repackaged and/or stored in unsanitary conditions could be contaminated.\"Wearing such masks may increase the users' risk of developing skin irritation, respiratory symptoms or infections,\" HSA said.It will take strong enforcement action against those who illegally manufacture and/or supply masks.Those who do so could be prosecuted and, if convicted, jailed for up to two years or fined up to $50,000, or both.This article was first published in The Straits Times. Permission required for reproduction.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/hsa-seizes-over-80000-masks-it-investigates-company-illegal-mask-manufacturing", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
