They are then required to self-isolate until they receive a negative PCR test result.\"Those who test negative on their self-test ART should still stay vigilant and adhere to prevailing safe management measures, MOH said.Individuals who have acute respiratory infection symptoms should visit a doctor for a full diagnosis and PCR test instead of relying on an ART self-test kit, it added.The Health Sciences Authority noted that ARTs have a lower sensitivity than PCR tests and a higher chance of false negative results.Get The New Paper on your phone with the free TNP app. Download from the Apple App StoreÂ or Google Play Store now", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/covid-self-test-kits-be-sold-some-pharmacies-june-16-moh", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
