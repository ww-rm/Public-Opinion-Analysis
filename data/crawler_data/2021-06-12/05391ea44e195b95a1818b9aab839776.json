We are therefore supportive of the tightened measures to ensure they are protected in the course of their work,” said National Trades Union Congress deputy secretary-general Cham Hui Fong.“Our unions will continue to work closely with the relevant stakeholders to mitigate any impact on them, and to ensure their wellbeing is taken care of,” she added.JEWEL TO REOPEN ON JUN 14Jewel, which has been closed to the public since May 13, will reopen on Jun 14.Changi Airport's passenger terminals will remain closed to the public to allow the airport community to adapt to the new zoning measures, which require “significant operational adjustments”, said CAAS and CAG.More details on the reopening of the passenger terminals will be released at a later date, they said.Since May 23, airport workers in higher risk roles have had to take an additional antigen rapid test (ART) between their seven-day polymerase chain reaction-based rostered routine tests.CAG and CAAS said that since Jun 3, it has been testing the use of the TracieX breathalyser, which allows workers to blow into a disposable breathalyser fitted with a proprietary sensor chip instead of undergoing an ART.TracieX was given provisional authorisation by the Health Sciences Authority on May 27.“The breathalyser will then be inserted into a portable reading device for vibrational spectroscopy analysis, which will be able to tell if a person is infected with COVID-19 within two minutes,” said CAG and CAAS.This will allow workers to receive their results faster than with the current ART, they said, adding that workers would also experience less discomfort as the test is non-invasive.“We aim to progressively replace the ART for more airport workers with the TracieX breathalyser in the coming months. This will also allow us to step up the frequency of testing so that we can more quickly detect, isolate and treat any potential COVID-19 cases in the airport community,” they said.Transport Minister S Iswaran, who visited Changi Airport on Friday, described the new breathalyser test as a “potential game changer” due to its method of administration.“We will gradually be scaling up the use of this breathalyser to validate its efficacy, and to be able to then scale up its use for a much wider range of workers,” he said, noting workers had told him the new test was a welcome alternative to the more invasive PCR and ART tests.REOPENING TRAVELWhen asked about comments made by South Korean authorities that the country planned to expedite travel bubble plans with Singapore, Mr Iswaran said Singapore was “engaging in dialogue with many potential partners”.To allow for cross-border travel, key elements - such as mutual recognition of vaccinations and testing protocols - need to be in place, he said.Meanwhile the enhanced safety measures allow the airport to adapt more quickly to emerging risks, he said, describing these measures as an important part of Singapore's \"overall posture towards a calibrated and safe reopening of travel\".“Once we have those elements in place then, at the appropriate time, when the ambient conditions are there, we can then activate that plan and mobilise the airlines and other partners to facilitate the kind of cross-border travel that we want to achieve.”Downloadour appor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna.asia/telegramIt looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "COVID-19,coronavirus,Changi Airport", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/jewel-changi-airport-reopens-15-million-support-for-workers-14993842", "Source": "google"}
