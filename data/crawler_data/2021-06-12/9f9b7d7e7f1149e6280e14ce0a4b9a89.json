So I have every reason to believe that what they say is true,\" she told AFP.Robbins said she had never heard of an \"accident\" of this type, but \"it may be that he (Packard) was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.\" \"When they (whales) fish... they rush forward, open their mouth and engulf the fish and the water very quickly,\" she said, adding they have large mouths, but throats so narrow they wouldn't be able to swallow a human.The whale, which according to Mayo's description was on the young side, \"may not be able to detect quickly enough that something is in the way.\" Even if all the details weren't yet known, one thing was clear for Robbins: \"It is important for people to be quite aware... And when they see a whale, keep a good distance. It's really important to give whales their space.\"Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.SPH Digital News / Copyright Â© 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
