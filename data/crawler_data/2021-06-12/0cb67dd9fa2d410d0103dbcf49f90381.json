To ensure that there are adequate supplies, sales will be initially limited to 10 ART kits per person, MOH added.The four kits that have been granted interim authorisation for public sale by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) are ‘Abbott PanBioTM COVID-19 Antigen Self-test’, ‘QuickVue At-Home OTC COVID-19 Test’, ‘SD Biosensor SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Self-Test Nasal’, and ‘SD Biosensor Standard Q COVID-19 Ag Home Test’.Director of medical services Kenneth Mak told reporters that the ART self-test kits complement Singapore's overall surveillance strategy. \"These fast and easy-to-use tests allow us to detect infected cases more quickly, in particular among individuals those who do not have acute respiratory infection symptoms, but are concerned that they may have been exposed to COVID-19.\"Individuals who have a positive result for their ART self-test should immediately approach a Swab and Send Home Public Health Preparedness Clinic (SASH PHPC) for a confirmatory Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test. They are then required to self-isolate until they get a negative PCR test result. Those who test negative on their self-test ART should continue to stay vigilant and adhere to prevailing safe management measures. Individuals who have ARI symptoms should continue to visit a doctor for a full diagnosis and PCR test instead of relying on an ART self-test kit.HSA said in a separate statement that ARTs have lower sensitivity than PCR tests and have a higher chance of false negative results. \"Incorrect sample preparation or testing process when using the test, or a low viral protein level in the user’s nasal sample (e.g. 1-2 days from potential exposure), could also result in a false negative result. Anyone with acute respiratory infection symptoms should consult a doctor,\" HSA said.Singapore is currently in Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) reopening, which started on 16 May and will end on 13 June. Stay in the know on-the-go: Join Yahoo Singapore's Telegram channel at http://t.me/YahooSingaporeOther stories:Singaporean woman, 86, dies from COVID-19; linked to TTSH clusterMan who wanted to get married in China breached SHN to appeal to ICAGurmit Singh, actor in COVID-19 jingle, fined $800 for speedingChina's quick rollout of a law against foreign sanctions has left European and American companies shocked and facing \"irreconcilable\" compliance issues, two top business groups said Friday, despite Beijing saying the move would unlikely impact investment.It is compulsory to have your car insured in Singapore.
