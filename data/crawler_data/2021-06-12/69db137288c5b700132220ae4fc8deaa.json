Japan donated 1.24 million AstraZeneca shots last week and the United States has pledged 750,000 doses, which have yet to arrive.Still, China's offer is not likely to be attractive to many Taiwanese. A poll by Taipei's National Chengchi University last month showed that most people would not be willing to get a Chinese vaccine.A Taiwan security official looking into Chinese activities told Reuters that the offer was another example of a Beijing influence campaign to sway public opinion on the island.\"This could be attractive for some people, but the problem is not many people can afford the costs,\" the official said, pointing to the expense and weeks in quarantine needed to travel between Taiwan and China.Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.SPH Digital News / Copyright Â© 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
