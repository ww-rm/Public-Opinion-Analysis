But the wording was almost identical to last month's statement by Hong Kong.That announcement was then followed by Hong Kong's government confirming the closure was indeed political.Taiwan, Hong Kong said, had \"grossly interfered\" in the city's affairs on repeated occasions and \"created irretrievable damage\" to relations.Hong Kong and Macau abide by authoritarian China's view that democratic, self-ruled Taiwan is part of its territory and must be seized one day, by force if necessary.That makes any official contact with Taipei tricky, even though Taiwan is a major trading partner.China had encouraged trade offices when relations were warmer.But since the 2016 election of Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen, Beijing cut official contacts and ramped up economic, military and diplomatic pressure.Beijing loathes Tsai because she regards Taiwan as a de facto sovereign nation and not part of \"one China\".Her government is also a vocal supporter of democratic principles and has quietly helped open its doors to some Hong Kongers trying to escape Beijing's crackdown on dissent after huge democracy protests rocked the financial hub in 2019.jta/qanAustralia recommended that AstraZeneca's Covid-19 jab should not be given to people under 60 on Thursday, a fresh blow to the country's glacial vaccine rollout.When 28 Chinese warplanes streaked through the skies around Taiwan on Tuesday – the largest such incursion this year – they followed a pattern that has generated alarm among US and Taiwanese military planners.Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James slammed the NBA on Wednesday as Clippers star Kawhi Leonard became the latest player forced out of the playoffs by injury.The freehold residential redevelopment site in Lorong J Telok Kurau Road presently seats two detached houses and a pair of semi-detached houses, which are to be sold collectively The post Freehold residential redevelopment site in Telok Kurau for sale at $30.6m appeared first on iCompareLoan.If you’re a foodie that’s leaving the comforts of your home to try the hottest restaurant in town, here are the credit cards you should have in your wallet.
