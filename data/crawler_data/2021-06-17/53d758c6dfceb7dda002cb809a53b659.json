Be sure to check out IGN's review for Episode 2!The first two episodes of Loki have certainly been eventful. They've introduced the multiverse-busting Time Variance Authority, established a brand new status quo for this Loki variant and even debuted a second version of Loki played by Sophia Di Martino. But is Di Martino actually playing a female version of Loki, or could she be a different Marvel villain entirely? The answer isn't as clear cut as you might think.Read on to learn why many fans are beginning to speculate this character is actually The Enchantress.Eagle-eyed Marvel fans have spotted evidence Di Martino's character may actually be The Enchantress. Whereas this character is generally listed as \"The Variant\" in the end credits, the Castilian Spanish dub instead lists the role as \"Sylvie.\" That also happens to be the first name of the second Marvel character to call herself Enchantress, Sylvie Lushton.Lending further fuel to that fire, IMDB lists The Walking Dead actress Cailey Fleming as playing \"Young Sylvie\" in Episode 4. This all suggests Di Martino's character isn't simply Loki under a different form, but a unique person with her own identity separate from that of Loki Laufeyson.There's also the fact that Enchantress is a character known for wearing green costumes with blond hair, which clearly sums up Lady Loki's fashion sense.None of this is to say that Di Martino isn't still playing a female version of Loki. If anything, this character is most likely inspired by the Lady Loki of the comics with elements of the Sylvie Lushton version of Enchantress thrown in for good measure. The blond hair may be a telltale sign of that blending. This wouldn't be the first time Marvel Studios has borrowed aspects of the Enchantress without including the character outright. In the comics, Amora is rarely seen without her faithful protector, Skurge the Executioner, by her side. Just as Amora pines after Thor, Skurge harbors an unrequited love for her. But in Thor: Ragnarok, Skurge is reimagined as a reluctant bodyguard to Hela (a character who herself is altered to become Thor and Loki's sister). In short, the MCU has a habit of streamlining and tweaking the familiar Thor mythos. It's also worth pointing out that Marvel already introduced an Enchantress-like character in the first season of Agents of SHIELD. Elena Satine plays Lorelei, an Asgardian character with similar powers of enchantment. In the comics, Lorelei is actually Amora's sister, though that family connection isn't referenced in the show. Plus, there's the whole issue of whether Agents of SHIELD is still considered to be part of the MCU canon...Based on the events of Loki Episode 2, we're meant to assume Di Martino is playing a version of Loki from an alternate timeline, or potentially a future version of Tom Hiddleston's Loki. It's entirely possible this Loki has a different backstory. Perhaps she was cast out of Asgard and forced to live among humans, hence her taking up the Sylvie Lushton name. Episode 4's Young Sylvie sequence may show us that tragic story. That life among humans might have profoundly affected her outlook on the universe and inspired what is clearly contempt for her male counterpart. It's worth remembering that even if Di Martino turns out to be playing a hybrid Lady Loki/Enchantress character, none of this necessarily prevents Marvel Studios from introducing a more traditional version of Enchantress in a future Thor movie. Amora could still be biding her time before emerging to cast a spell over Asgard.For more, check out the Loki release schedule, dig in on how Loki evolved from Marvel villain to agent of chaos in the comics, and check out some Kang the Conqueror theories.Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.
