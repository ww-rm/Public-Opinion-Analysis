Its post on 29 May revealed that Warabi Enterprise (Art Studio) had been engaged by Radin Mas Constituency Office (CO) to design and put up Hari Raya decorations at the Tiong Bahru Orchid estate.However, in the process, the vendor downloaded Sarah’s photo from an online source and then used it for a cut-out standee. And while the PA spoke to the vendor on the seriousness of the incident, it stressed, \"The PA, including Radin Mas CO, take responsibility for this error as we have oversight of the matter.\"In addition, the PA offered on Monday to meet with the couple to apologise in person. \"We also wished to clarify our position, elaborate on the steps we have taken to prevent such incidents from recurring, and hear her suggestions of how we might improve at the meeting.\"However, it claimed that Sarah had said this incident “perpetuate(s) the racist culture” and characterised the incident as “racist”. In an Instagram Live interview with Walid J. Abdullah last Tuesday, said the PA, she also insinuated that PA staff and volunteers did not find anything wrong with the standee as they might be “blind to racism”.\"These are accusations we reject,\" said the PA.Furthermore, in Sarah's public social media posts about her upcoming meeting with the PA, she had made a public call for anyone to “please share your messages/suggestions to PA here and we’ll share them”.  \"We find this odd,\" said the PA. \"We do not see why our meeting should be appropriated as a platform for her to funnel the views and comments of persons unrelated to the incident.\"The PA added, \"All these lead us to believe her purpose in agreeing to meet with us has gone far beyond the Radin Mas incident. We therefore see no point in proceeding with the meeting.\"It also claimed that Sarah’s email to the PA on 1 June alleged that it was “hasty in sharing the name of the vendor” in order to “distance and deflect blame” from itself. \"This is untrue. The vendor had identified himself directly to Ms Sarah on 28 May, and apologised. This was before PA issued our statement on 29 May,\" said the PA. \"It is regrettable that Ms Sarah did not clarify this point during her Instagram Live interview with Mr Walid J. Abdullah on 7 June. Instead she persisted in conveying the impression that PA had deflected blame from itself.\"We hope that this incident will not tar the other good work which our staff and volunteers have done.\"PA also said it is looking at setting up a resource panel to guide its staff on cultural matters, and stepping up training to enhance its staff and volunteers' understanding and appreciation of different cultures.Stay in the know on-the-go: Join Yahoo Singapore's Telegram channel at http://t.me/YahooSingaporeMore stories:Of 25 new COVID cases in Singapore, 19 local including 1 dorm residentMan who smuggled 3 dogs and 3 cats from pet shop in JB jailed 24 weeksE-scooter, PAB riders must pass online theory test from 1 Jan 2022Burner phones, safehouses, sheltering with rebels and months away from loved ones -- Myanmar anti-coup activists have been driven underground by a brutal crackdown but have no regrets about choosing life on the run.The freehold residential redevelopment site in Lorong J Telok Kurau Road presently seats two detached houses and a pair of semi-detached houses, which are to be sold collectively The post Freehold residential redevelopment site in Telok Kurau for sale at $30.6m appeared first on iCompareLoan.China’s output of integrated circuits (IC) in May reached an all-time, single-month high as the country pulled out all stops to produce chips amid a severe global shortage of semiconductors, according to data released by the central government on Wednesday.
