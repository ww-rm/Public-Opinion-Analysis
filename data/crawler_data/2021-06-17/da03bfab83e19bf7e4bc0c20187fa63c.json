A junta spokesman did not answer calls requesting comment.All that remained of Kin Ma on Wednesday was about 30 houses, with some 200 homes reduced to piles of ash and bricks, according to several villagers who gave accounts of the incident by telephone and photographs seen by Reuters.The blaze was large enough to be recorded by Nasa's satellite fire-tracking system at 9.52 pm on Tuesday.The villagers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that security forces set the fires after confronting opponents of the junta and that at least two people were killed.A 32-year-old volunteer assisting people displaced from the village said the two people killed were elderly residents who had been unable to flee their home during the fire. He said some people returned to the village on Wednesday and found the bodies.Most of the village's residents remained in hiding in nearby forests, the villagers who spoke with Reuters said.MRTV said 40 \"terrorists\" torched a house in Kin Ma, starting a fire that spread to 100 of the village's 225 homes.Myanmar has been gripped by violence and protests since the military overthrew elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb 1, returning as the country's outright rulers after a decade of tentative democracy and economic reform.The overthrow of Ms Suu Kyi's government, for alleged electoral violations, sparked protests almost daily in many parts of Myanmar and ignited conflict between the military and rebel groups.Photographs taken on Wednesday of the aftermath showed a thin haze of smoke above Kin Ma from white embers that smouldered on blackened ground.Burnt planks of wood, sheet metal, bricks and cooking pots were scattered around, with only a few trees left standing. Some images showed animal carcasses.\"Reports that the junta has burned down an entire village in Magway, killing elderly residents, demonstrate once again that the military continues to commit terrible crimes and has no regard for the people of Myanmar,\" Britain's embassy in Myanmar said on Twitter, quoting its ambassador Dan Chugg.\nSmoke is seen rising from a fire in the village of Kin Ma in Myanmar on June 16, 2021.
