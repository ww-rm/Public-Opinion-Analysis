But the reclusive country has imposed strict anti-virus measures including border closures and domestic travel restrictions.COVAX, a global initiative for sharing COVID-19 vaccines with poor countries, has said it will provide nearly 2 million doses to North Korea but the shipment has been delayed amid protracted consultations.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "North Korea,Kim Jong Un,COVID-19", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/north-korea-kim-jong-un-food-crisis-covid-19-typhoon-15023476", "Source": "google"}
