He has also been the chief negotiator in Sino-US trade talks since the days of former US President Donald Trump.About US$1 trillion of government funding has been set aside under the technology initiative, part of which will be used by central and local governments to jointly invest in a series of third-generation chip projects, Bloomberg reported.China's State Council and Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did not immediately respond to faxed requests for comment.Earlier this month, the US Senate approved a sweeping package of legislation intended to boost the country's ability to compete with Chinese technology, drawing indignation from China, which objected to being cast as an \"imaginary\" US enemy.The measure authorises about US$190 billion for provisions to strengthen US technology and research - and would separately approve spending US$54 billion to increase US production and research into semiconductors and telecommunications equipment, including US$2 billion dedicated to chips used by automakers that have seen massive shortages and caused significant production cuts.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "China,chips", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/xi-picks-vice-premier-liu-he-to-oversee-china-s-chipmaking-push---bloomberg-15033082", "Source": "google"}
