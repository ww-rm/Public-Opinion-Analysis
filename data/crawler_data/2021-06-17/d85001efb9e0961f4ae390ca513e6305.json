That was due in part to higher expenses incurred from share-based compensation to workers, a person familiar with the matter said, while expenses also soared as ByteDance boosted spending to acquire users and support its content creators. It earned gross profit of $19 billion on revenue of $34.3 billion, which more than doubled. Net loss ballooned to $45 billion, mainly stemming from accounting adjustments.A ByteDance spokesperson confirmed the figures in an email to Bloomberg News. The losses were earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal.Speculation over a potential ByteDance IPO has been growing, with the company said to target a listing of its Chinese assets that could raise several billion dollars, people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg News in April.
