A decision on the maximum number of spectators for the Olympics is due by the end of the month.Polls have shown most Japanese remain wary of the Games, particularly as vaccination rates are still lower than in other wealthy nations.Omi previously called on the government to better explain to the public how it expects to prevent infections while hosting the Games.Public broadcaster NHK said on Thursday that Omi and other health experts had compiled proposals for the Games. The proposals will state that banning live spectators will be the least risky way method, and that if spectators are to be allowed, there should be more restrictions than those applied to other large-scale events.Downloadour appor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna.asia/telegramIt looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "Japan,Olympics,COVID-19,Tokyo 2020", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/olympics-japan-covid-19-state-of-emergency-games-spectators-15031814", "Source": "google"}
