We target perpetrators who would use journalistic work as a tool to engage in acts that endanger national security.\"Sharron Fast, a lecturer at the University of Hong Kong's journalism school, described Lee's comments as \"ominous and incorrect\".\"It is precisely the role of a journalist in a free society to report on political views, even those that might be unwelcome,\" she told AFP.Apple Daily broadcast live footage of the raid showing officers searching the newsroom and looking through journalists' computers.The paper said computer terminals, hard drives and reporter notepads were among items carted away.Among the arrested executives were chief editor Ryan Law and CEO Cheung Kim-hung who were both led into the building in handcuffs.Hong Kong's stock exchange said trading in shares of Next Digital -- the publisher of the newspaper -- had been halted.- Crackdown -The security law is the speartip of a sweeping crackdown on Beijing's critics in Hong Kong since 2019's huge democracy protests.It has criminalised much dissent, given China jurisdiction over some cases and awarded authorities a suite of powerful new investigation powers.Those convicted face up to life in prison and the majority are denied bail after arrest.Thursday's raid was the second on Apple Daily in less than a year.The tabloid's billionaire owner Lai, 73, was charged with collusion after hundreds of officers searched the paper's newsroom last August.He is currently serving multiple jail sentences for attending various protests.Beijing has made no secret of its desire to see the paper's voice tamed, with state media routinely describing Lai as a \"traitor\" and a \"black hand\".Last month, police used the national security law to freeze Lai's bank accounts and his majority shares in Next Digital.- 'Try to publish' -Until Thursday's raid, authorities had left the company's assets alone. It is unclear whether Apple Daily will now be able to pay its staff.\"We will try all our best to publish newspapers for tomorrow,\" executive chief editor Lam Man-chung, who was not among those arrested, told AFP.China says the security law was needed to return stability to the international financial hub.Critics, including many Western nations, say it has been the final nail in the coffin for the \"One Country, Two Systems\" promise that Hong Kong could maintain certain liberties after its 1997 handover to China by the British.More than 100 people have been arrested under the law, many of them the city's best-known democracy activists. Others have fled overseas.Speaking with AFP last month, chief editor Law admitted the paper was in \"crisis\" since Lai's jailing but said his reporters were determined to press on with publishing.Asked by staff what they should do if the police came to arrest him, he replied: \"Broadcast it live.\"su/jta/axnBurner phones, safehouses, sheltering with rebels and months away from loved ones -- Myanmar anti-coup activists have been driven underground by a brutal crackdown but have no regrets about choosing life on the run.The freehold residential redevelopment site in Lorong J Telok Kurau Road presently seats two detached houses and a pair of semi-detached houses, which are to be sold collectively The post Freehold residential redevelopment site in Telok Kurau for sale at $30.6m appeared first on iCompareLoan.China’s output of integrated circuits (IC) in May reached an all-time, single-month high as the country pulled out all stops to produce chips amid a severe global shortage of semiconductors, according to data released by the central government on Wednesday.
