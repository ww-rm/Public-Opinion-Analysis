Toni and I are friends. It was nothing big. We hugged after the game and it's over,\" Pogba said.Pogba, the man of the match in Munich, said it was \"better\" that Ruediger escaped punishment.\"I don't want him to be suspended because of that,\" said the Frenchman, who played a key role in the build-up to Mats Hummels' ultimately decisive own goal.Pogba said he told the referee what happened but was glad there was no \"yellow or red card for such an incident\". In the build-up to the match, Champions League winner Ruediger had said the Germans would need to \"be a little dirty\" against the French.© 2016 - 2021 PT.
