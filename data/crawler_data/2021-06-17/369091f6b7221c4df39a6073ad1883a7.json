It is unclear whether Apple Daily will now be able to pay its staff.China says the security law was needed to return stability to the international financial hub.Critics, including many Western nations, say it has been the final nail in the coffin for the \"One Country, Two Systems\" promise that Hong Kong could maintain certain liberties after the 1997 handover.More than 100 people have been arrested under the law, many from among the city's best-known democracy activists. Others have fled overseas.su/jta/axn/legChina and other nations were attempting to “seize control” of strategically important international organisations so they could be “weaponised”, a new report by the UK parliament’s influential Foreign Affairs Committee said.
