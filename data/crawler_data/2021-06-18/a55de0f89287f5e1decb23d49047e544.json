It also gives the impression that the Prime Minister has lost confidence to continue governing,\" said the PH statement.It added that if the prime minister still refuses to advise the king soon, he should take the honorable step by resigning.Among state governments, Selangor chief minister Amirudin Shari announced on Thursday that he would meet with the state assembly speaker to begin plans to reconvene the legislature, including obtaining assent from the state ruler.Downloadour appor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna.asia/telegramIt looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "Malaysia,politics,state of emergency,Muhyiddin Yassin", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/malaysia-government-king-views-follow-up-measures-muhyiddin-pmo-15033084", "Source": "google"}
