(AFP/Stuart Franklin )The match was paused after 10 minutes -- a reference to Eriksen's number 10 -- for a minute's applause for the Denmark midfielder, who suffered a cardiac arrest in his team's game against Finland last weekend.The 29-year-old Inter Milan player is recovering in hospital and will have a defibrillator implanted.A section of fans in the 25,000 crowd held up a banner reading \"All of Denmark is with you, Christian\" as the match was halted.If the Danes were traumatised by Eriksen's collapse or by facing the world's top-ranked team, they did not show it.Just after a minute, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg picked up a misplaced pass by Jason Denayer and found Poulsen who took the ball inside the box and fired across Thibaut Courtois into the bottom corner.At one minute and 39 seconds, it was the second fastest goal in European Championship history, trailing only Dmitri Kirichenko's goal after 67 seconds as Russia beat eventual champions Greece in 2004.Belgium started with De Bruyne, Eden Hazard and Axel Witsel on the bench, but Roberto Martinez sent them all into action after the break and their presence made all the difference.Eriksen's Inter Milan teammate Romelu Lukaku sprinted into the box on 55 minutes and found De Bruyne who set up Thorgan Hazard to equalise with a brilliant pass through the stunned Danish defence.Belgium's midfielder Thorgan Hazard scores the team's first goal during the UEFA EURO 2020 Group B football match between Denmark and Belgium at the Parken Stadium in Copenhagen on June 17, 2021.
