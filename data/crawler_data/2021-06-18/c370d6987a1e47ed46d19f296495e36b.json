The average number of children born for every resident woman aged 40 to 49 who had ever been married fell from 2.02 in 2010 to 1.76 last year.Within this age group, women who were university graduates had an average of 1.66 children last year - marking a steady decline from 1.74 children 10 years ago and 1.95 in 2000.Singaporeans are also better educated. Among residents aged 25 and over, almost six in 10 (58.3 per cent) attained post-secondary or higher qualifications, up from less than half (46.5 per cent) in 2010. The Chinese, Malay and Indian communities all saw improvements.Women closed the educational gap with men in each successive cohort.When it came to those aged 25 to 34, the proportion of women (90.2 per cent) with post-secondary or higher qualifications exceeded men (90 per cent).English was the language most frequently spoken at home for 48.3 per cent of residents aged five and over last year, up from 32.3 per cent in 2010. Most of them also spoke a vernacular language at home.There are growing numbers of Singaporeans who cite no religious affiliation.The proportion was 20 per cent last year, up 3 percentage points from a decade ago. This number was 15 per cent in 2000. The increase took place across all age groups and most types of educational qualifications.FOR MORE, READ THE STRAITS TIMESGet The New Paper on your phone with the free TNP app. Download from the Apple App StoreÂ or Google Play Store now", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/singapore-sees-slowest-population-growth-1965", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
