And it was Kjaer who raced over to comfort Eriksen’s wife, Sabrina, who was understandably distraught pitchside as her husband fought for his life on what should have been a day of celebration.It was a performance that redefined what it means to be a captain of a national team.But those who know Kjaer and have been privy to the bond that this Denmark team has shown over recent years would not have expected anything less from the 32-year-old.Speaking to  Goal  ahead of the 2018 World Cup in Russia, a tournament in which the Danes held eventual champions France to a scoreless draw and went undefeated through normal time only to lose to runners-up Croatia in the last 16 on penalties, the centre-back helped to outline the unique bond that this squad possesses.“Football is a team sport, and I believe that our Denmark squad is a symbol of that,” Kjaer said. “The team spirit is our strength, and I am proud of that as captain of this great group, who can work hard but also laugh together.“No one is above our team – even though we have one player who could deserve to hold that position in Christian Eriksen. He is definitely the star of our team, but he is also ‘just’ one piece in the puzzle of 11 players – or more correctly – of the full squad.\"He never puts himself above the team.”  It is a theme that regularly shines through in Kjaer’s words. Following Denmark’s qualification for the current European Championship in 2019: “I am also a proud captain because we have a great group of guys who simply enjoy spending time together, playing football together, winning together.\"And in my own humble opinion, the values of this team fits perfectly to my own personality.”That was certainly reflected in his vital intervention in Copenhagen, where his special understanding with Eriksen, a player he has grown through the national ranks together with, was abundantly clear.“Christian and I started in the national team at the same time, we were both selected as very young players for the World Cup in South Africa, and we have played a lot of matches together,” Kjaer explained in 2018.Fate, however, may have dictated that they have played their last game together.A large question mark understandably hangs over Eriksen’s future in the game, and though Kjaer had to be withdrawn in the second half of Saturday's game, he will doutbless continue to lead his country with distinction after becoming the hero of Euro 2020.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.goal.com/en-sg/news/the-hero-of-euro-2020-kjaer-redefines-what-it-means-to-be-a/cn52shsdh00o1ithweidormqf", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
