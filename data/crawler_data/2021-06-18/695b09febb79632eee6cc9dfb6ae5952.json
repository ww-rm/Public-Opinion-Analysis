PHOTO: NATIONAL HERITAGE BOARD\nUpon the institute’s confirmation that the plates were high-quality celadon ceramics dated to the 14th century, the National Heritage Board (NHB) partnered the institute to conduct a survey at the Pedra Branca site, discovering a shipwreck in 2016.Following the end of excavation works for the first shipwreck, NHB and ISEAS conducted a survey around Pedra Branca and uncovered a second shipwreck dating to the late 18th century. Efforts were then made to excavate this shipwreck between 2019 and 2021.The first wreck was located about 100m north-west of the island, the NHB and ISEAS announced on Wednesday (June 16). The second wreck was found 300m east of Pedra Branca.In an interview with The Straits Times about the historic finds, Dr Flecker said various Chinese ceramics formed a large majority of the haul from the first wreck, with some matching those previously excavated in mainland Singapore.For instance, Longquan greenware dishes from the first wreck match those that had been unearthed earlier at Fort Canning, with both bearing a double fish motif.\"From Fort Canning, there is a plate that is so similar you might almost be tempted to think they used the same stamp (to produce the motif),\" said Dr Flecker, a visiting fellow at ISEAS.While research is ongoing, Dr Flecker said the find would be especially significant if it could be proven that the vessel was going to call at Singapore - something he believes to be true.Ceramics from the wreck are also similar to those excavated at Empress Place in 2015, and more research will be done to improve existing knowledge on maritime trading history in the region during the 14th century.Dr Flecker, who has more than 30 years of maritime archaeology experience, added that the Yuan blue-and-white ceramic haul from the first wreck is also the largest that has been recovered from a shipwreck to date.\"There's only been three other (wreck) sites with Yuan blue-and-white porcelain anywhere in the world, and in much smaller quantities,\" he said, adding that it was clear from the primary cargo of both vessels - Chinese ceramics - that they were loaded in China.The Shah Munchah wreck site yielded a much wider range of artefacts, from instruments to cannon.Among the surprising finds were percussion instruments, including a tambourine and a coconut shaker with a handle, said Dr Flecker.Wooden frame parasols, metal betel nut cutters and a myriad of figurines were also retrieved by divers.\nThe Shah Munchah wreck site yielded a wider range of artefacts, including glass bottle stopper, metal betal nut cutters, medallions and figurines.

ST PHOTO: GIN TAY\nThe two historical shipwrecks are the first to be found within Singapore's waters, and will contribute to a better understanding of the nation's maritime past. As there were no claims to the wrecks and their artefacts at the end of the stipulated notice period of a month, they have been claimed by Singapore.Although it is very likely there are more wrecks on the seabed in Singapore's waters, some of these have been covered by reclamation, while heavy maritime traffic in the Singapore Strait makes locating others a hazard.NHB's director of heritage research and assessment Yeo Kirk Siang said: \"As an island that has been serving as the gateway to Asia for centuries, Singapore today is the legacy of our rich maritime heritage.\nIn a storage facility, encrustations are removed from an artefact. ISEAS - YUSOF ISHAK INSTITUTE\n\"We will continue to research the significance of the artefacts and find ways to promote the knowledge, so as to enable more people to learn about them and Singapore's maritime history.\"NHB plans to display the artefacts in museums here from the end of this year, while ISEAS will likely publish findings progressively in reports and research papers.Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
