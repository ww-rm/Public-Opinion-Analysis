He will look for opportunities to engage with President Xi going forward,\" Sullivan said.He said there were no plans scheduled to meet Xi but noted that both presidents were likely to take part in a summit in October in Italy of the Group of 20 major economies.\"Soon enough we will sit down to work out the right modality for the two presidents to engage,\" Sullivan said.Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.SPH Digital News / Copyright Â© 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
