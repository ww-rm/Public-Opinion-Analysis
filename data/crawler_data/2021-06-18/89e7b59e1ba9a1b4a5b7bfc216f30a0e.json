We feel this is a missed opportunity for constructive dialogue; for thoughts and suggestions of members of the community to be relayed, and also for the People's Association to listen to the people's voices. It is unfortunate that the PA has turned this opportunity down,\" she said.\"We will continue to advocate for deeper intercultural understanding and greater social cohesion in our everyday lives as Singaporeans,\" Ms Sarah added.On Monday, the PA said it had wanted to clarify its position, elaborate on the steps it had taken to prevent such incidents from recurring, and hear her suggestions of how it might improve at the meeting.[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/CQI44OhBNV3/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading[/embed]It also said it had, over e-mail, explained to Ms Sarah that it values racial and religious harmony in Singapore.The PA also said that what happened in Radin Mas was an isolated incident, but nevertheless shows that it can fall short.\"We agree it is important for our staff and volunteers to be sensitive to and knowledgeable about the cultures of all our ethnic groups. We are now looking at establishing a resource panel to guide and advise our staff on cultural matters,\" it said.It added that it will also step up training efforts to enhance staff and volunteers' understanding and appreciation of Singapore's different cultures.This article was first published in The Straits Times.
