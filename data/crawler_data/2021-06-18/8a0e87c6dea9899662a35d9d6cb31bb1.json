His business in the downstream and upstream logging sector and his illegal logging activities, including business in oil palm plantations, have destroyed forests and caused state losses,\" Arie Rompas, forest campaign team leader of environmental group Greenpeace Indonesia, told The Straits Times.Leonard said Adelin has been a fugitive since 2008 and was listed on the Interpol Red Notice.In August 2008, Indonesia's Supreme Court found him guilty of corruption and illegal logging in North Sumatra province, and sentenced him to 10 years in prison and a fine of 110 billion rupiah (US$7million).The verdict overturned a previous acquittal by a lower court, Medan District Court, in November 2007 which had sparked public outcry nationwide on concerns that witness testimonies were not properly considered by the judges and field investigation was lacking.Adelin, the son of the owner of PT Mujur Timber, a wood processing company in Sibolga, North Sumatra, has been on the wanted list of the North Sumatra Prosecutor's Office since July 2012.Leonard also said Adelin and his bodyguards had resisted arrest at the Indonesian Embassy in Beijing in 2006, beating up the embassy staff before fleeing.As such, Indonesia's Attorney General hopes the Indonesian law enforcement officers will be allowed \"a special pick-up of this high-profile fugitive\" from Singapore, he added.According to the ICA, the Indonesian embassy had offered to repatriate Adelin to Indonesia via private air transportation on June 16.\"However, ICA had declined this arrangement as the repatriation of all undesirable foreigners is independently conducted by Singapore authorities,\" the IC spokesperson said.\"In accordance with ICA's established procedure, Adelin Lis will be repatriated to his country of origin as soon as his commercial flight arrangement is confirmed.\" - The Straits Times/Asia News Network\nTags / Keywords:\nSingapore\n                                                                ,\n                                                                                                Indonesia\n                                                                ,\n                                                                                                Adelin Lis\n                                                                ,\n                                                                                                immigration\n                                                                ,\n                                                                                                illegal\n                                                                ,\n                                                                                                logging\n                                                                ,\n                                                                                                fugitive\n                                                                ,\n                                                                                                arrested\n\n\n\nReport it to us.Thank you for your report!Copyright © 1995-\n            \n\n Star Media Group Berhad (10894D)Best viewed on Chrome browsers.{{item['V1 Header']}}\n   {{item['V1 Body']}}\n\n  {{item['V2 Header']}}\n\nWe would love to keep you posted on the latest promotion.
