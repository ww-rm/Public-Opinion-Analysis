She said the United States was also proposing changes to prevent foreign companies working in the United States from shifting their profits offshore.Asked about rising consumer and durable goods prices, Yellen said the Biden administration was monitoring inflation \"very carefully\" and took the issue seriously.\"No one wants to return to the bad high inflation days of the 70s,\" Yellen told the committee.She said the current burst of inflation reflected the difficulty of reopening the US economy, and the Biden administration was also taking steps to deal with bottlenecks in certain supply chains that had resulted in higher prices.Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.SPH Digital News / Copyright Â© 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
