We will share additional information as it becomes available,\" an Akamai spokesperson said.A series of high-profile hack-for-ransom attacks have also left corporations around the world jittery over cybersecurity risks, although there was no indication the latest problems were caused by malicious actors.Colonial Pipeline was briefly shuttered after an attack in May, and JBS, the world's largest meat producer, was forced to stop operations in the United States and Australia.Both firms reportedly paid ransoms to get operations back up and running.The issue of cybersecurity was at the top of the agenda when US President Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin met in Geneva on Wednesday.Washington believes hackers who have extorted hundreds of millions of dollars from Western governments, companies, and organisations operate from Russian soil.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "Akamai,Fastly,cyber security,US,Australia", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/united-states-australia-banks-airlines-online-outage-akamai-15033212", "Source": "google"}
