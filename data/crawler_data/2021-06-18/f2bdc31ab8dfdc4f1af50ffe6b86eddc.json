When he was found he was so skinny he looked like a goat, reported The Jakarta Post.Caretakers nursed him back to health, and moved him to what would become his permanent home, the Jiancuan Museum in Sichuan, where he lived in a roomy pen and was regularly visited by admirers.  Strong Pig became an attraction, but he also garnered a legacy. In 2011, NPR reported that he had been cloned and six piglets bearing his hardy DNA had been weaned.In mid-May, the South China Morning Post reported that the 14-year-old pig — around 100 years old in human years — was in failing health.He died on Wednesday night, his caretakers said, of \"old age and exhaustion.\" Memorials poured out to Strong Pig across the Chinese social media site Weibo in response to the news. The hashtag StrongPigDied has more than 300 million views already, Agence France-Presse reported.  Rest easy, old friend. ", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.insider.com/heroic-strong-pig-survived-2008-china-earthquake-mourned-2021-6", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
