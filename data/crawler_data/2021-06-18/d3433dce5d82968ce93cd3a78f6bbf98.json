Hong Kong was ranked at seventh, down from No 5.China’s post-pandemic economic performance has been a key driver of its improving global competitiveness and its management of the virus contributed significantly to its higher ranking this year, said Christos Cabolis, chief economist at the International Institute for Management Development’s (IMD) World Competitiveness Centre.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Yet, we are confident that Hong Kong’s institutional strengths, including the rule of law and independence of the judiciary, free trade and investment regimes, a simple and low tax system, a favourable business environment and an efficient government, remain unscathed,” a government spokesman said in a statement.Hong Kong retains the top position for government efficiency, while the city ranks slightly lower than previous reports in aspects such as economic performance, business efficiency and infrastructure.More from South China Morning Post:China’s C919 faces new hurdle after US-Europe aviation deal, but accord unlikely to be a ‘game changer’China won’t benefit from ‘loopholes’ in global minimum tax plan, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen saysChina’s retail sales ‘bright spot’ amid uneven economic recoveryHong Kong stock exchange must expand reforms to allow SPACs and smaller companies to raise funds, experts sayGreater Bay Area home prices may lose momentum with a drop in June while Hong Kong’s housing bull market races aheadThis article China climbs list of world’s most competitive economies, as Hong Kong and Singapore slide first appeared on South China Morning PostFor the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app. Copyright 2021.Israeli jets launched air strikes on Gaza overnight Thursday to Friday after militants in the Palestinian territory again set off incendiary balloons into southern Israel, the army and AFP journalists said.Rafael Nadal and Naomi Osaka, with 24 Grand Slam titles between them, both withdrew from Wimbledon on Thursday with the Spanish star also pulling out of the Tokyo Olympics in a bid \"to prolong my career\".New research has identified TEN favorite stocks for the upcoming yearA spiked drink, a puff of dust, missing memories, and an empty bank account.Beijing said on Wednesday it did not fear the relationship between the United States and the European Union after the two sides announced they would set up a body to write economic rules and take other steps to face rising competition from China.
