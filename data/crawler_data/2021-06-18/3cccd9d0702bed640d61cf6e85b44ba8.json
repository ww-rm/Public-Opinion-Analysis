But he did not renew his re-entry permit as a permanent resident after it expired in December 2007 and so his PR status lapsed.While he was still a Singapore PR, the businessman made 14 trips to Singapore, entering and departing the country a total of 28 times via Changi Airport between April 2005 and September 2006. He used his real passport on each trip.According to a report in the Jakarta Post, Adelin was sentenced to 10 years' jail by the Indonesian Supreme Court in August 2008 for corruption and illegal logging in North Sumatra. He has been on the wanted list of the North Sumatra Prosecutor's Office since July 2012, the Jakarta Post report dated 23 July 2019 said.According to the court documents by Singapore prosecutors, Adelin was arrested by immigration officers at Changi Airport's Terminal 3 departure hall on 8 May 2018. He was trying to leave the country with an Indonesian passport bearing the name of \"Hendro Leonardi\". The passport also stated Hendro's age to be three years younger than Adelin.Investigations revealed that the fugitive obtained the passport in 2008 and used it to successfully travel to and from Singapore several times between July 2017 and 2018.He entered Singapore on 20 July 2017 via Seletar Airport, and again on 26 October 2017, 11 February 2018 and 16 May 2018 via Changi Airport.Each time he arrived, he obtained a 30-day Visit Pass by falsely declaring in his Disembarkation Form that he had never used a passport under a different name to enter the country. He departed Singapore on 24 July 2017, 2 November 2017 and 20 February 2018 via Changi Airport.But while trying to leave the country via Terminal 3 on 28 May 2018, Adelin's ruse fell apart and he was arrested.Court documents did not state how his cover was blown and his real identity established.For each of Adelin's four proceeded charges of making a false statement to obtain an entry pass, he could have been fined up to $4,000 and/or jailed up to a year.The penalty for producing a false document to an immigration officer is a fine of up to $6,000 and/or a jail term of up to two years.The punishment for entering Singapore without a valid pass which has been lawfully issued is a jail term of up to six months with at least three strokes of the cane for male offenders below 50. Those found unsuitable for caning face a fine of up to $6,000 in lieu of caning.Yahoo News Singapore has reached out to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority on Adelin's status and whether he remains in Singapore or if he has been deported.Stay in the know on-the-go: Join Yahoo Singapore's Telegram channel at http://t.me/YahooSingaporeMore Singapore stories:Man jailed for molesting two male victims and supermarket theftWoman hit waitress' face with glass jug, causing permanent scarOf 27 new COVID cases in Singapore, 20 in communityAirbnb owner filmed woman in home toilet with pinhole camera24 providers licensed by MOH to provide Sinovac vaccineNgee Ann Poly lecturer who made racist remarks in video to be firedFormer Taiwanese president Ma Ying-jeou has called on the government to listen to public opinion and allow civilian groups which have different political leanings to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party to import much-needed Covid-19 vaccines.
