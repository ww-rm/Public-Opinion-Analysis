Who will be stronger? Let’s analyze the teams’ form and advise on what is the best bet.How good were the Ukrainians in the first match! Although they had to fight with a powerful Dutch team, they were not afraid of them at all. No fear and confident game. In the first half none of the teams miraculously opened the scoring, but at the beginning of the second half, the Dutch scored twice. However, on 75 minutes Andriy Yarmolenko netted the winning goal, and literally, four minutes later Roman Yaremchuk equalised. Everything was going great for Andriy Shevchenko’s charges, but they conceded the equaliser on 85 minutes (2-3). Thus, Ukraine have zero points and will fight to win.It was a miracle for North Macedonia to qualify for UEFA EURO 2020, but on the eve of the tournament itself, they beat Germany 2-1 in the World Cup 2022 qualifier. The first leg at the European Championships against Austria went well for the Macedonians. They conceded a goal on 18 minutes, but just ten minutes later the legendary veteran of the team, Goran Pandev, equalised. The score 1-1 was kept until 78 minutes, but then two goals flew into the net of Northern Macedonia. It was a shameful defeat, but to be honest, it felt like the team were playing their best in that game. The Macedonians are in last place in Group C.The Northern Macedonian team can already pack their bags as the Ukrainians and the Dutch are next in line and they have zero points. Had they managed to get a draw against Austria, everything would have been different. However, they failed to do that, so it seems they have no chance at all to take third place. Ukraine impressed after the match with the Netherlands, although the defeat was disappointing. \nThere is no doubt that today Andriy Shevchenko’s team will be extremely angry and will score against Macedonians what they failed to score against the Dutch. There are plenty of options for betting on Ukraine, from win to nil and all sorts of victories with handicaps to individual totals. We suggest betting on Ukraine’s Total Over 1.5.\nAll materials on this site are available under license Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International.
