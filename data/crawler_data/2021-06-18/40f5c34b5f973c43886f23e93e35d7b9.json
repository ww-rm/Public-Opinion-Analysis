They had drawn 1-1 with Switzerland last week.In last night's Group B game, a goal in first-half injury time by Aleksei Miranchuk got Russia's Euro 2020 campaign back on track as they beat Finland 1-0.Joel Pohjanpalo thought he had given the Finns the lead in the fifth minute, but his powerful header was ruled out for offside after a VAR (video assistant referee) review.  With both sides committing men forward, Miranchuk popped up just before the break to curl in a superb left-footed effort.The result moves Russia up to second in Group B on three points, ahead of Finland thanks to the head-to-head result.
