People visit the statue, which is holding a baby, to pray for the safe delivery of babies and to ask for blessings for their newborns.Temple manager Takaomi Horigane said workers came up with the idea for the face mask in discussions on the restoration of the statue after it was damaged in an earthquake in February.Horigane said they plan to keep the mask on the statue until the Covid-19 situation is under control in Japan. ", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.asiaone.com/asia/giant-buddhist-goddess-japan-gets-face-mask-pray-end-covid-19", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
