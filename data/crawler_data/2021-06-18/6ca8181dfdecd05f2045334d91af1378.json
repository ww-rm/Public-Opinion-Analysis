Electronics exports grew, while non-electronics declined, ESG added.On a seasonally adjusted basis, the level of NODX remained at S$15.4 billion, similar to the previous month.EXPORTS BY COUNTRYNODX to the top markets as a whole rose in May, though exports to the US, Japan and the EU declined.The largest contributors to this increase were China, Hong Kong and Malaysia.Exports to China grew 36.9 per cent due to specialised machinery, petrochemicals and disk media products.Exports to Hong Kong expanded by 30.2 per cent, due to integrated circuits, non-electric engines and motors, as well as telecommunications equipment.Shipments to Malaysia rose by 27.1 per cent, due to petrochemicals, specialised machinery and diodes and transistors.Exports to emerging markets also grew by 41.4 per cent, mainly due to South Asia, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam, as well as the Middle East.OTHER TRADE INDICATORSNon-oil re-exports grew at a slower pace of 31.6 per cent in May from a low base a year ago, following the 34.3 per cent in April, with growth in both electronics and non-electronics. The top contributors were exports to Hong Kong, China and Malaysia.Total trade expanded 30.9 per cent in May on a year-on-year basis, extending the 26.3 per cent growth in the previous month. Both imports and exports increased, by 32.2 per cent and 29.8 per cent respectively.However, total trade declined on a month-on-month seasonally adjusted basis, reaching S$95 billion in May, lower than the previous month’s S$95.8 billion.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "Trade,Exports,NODX", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/singapore-exports-may-2021-nodx-growth-8-8-per-cent-15031460", "Source": "google"}
