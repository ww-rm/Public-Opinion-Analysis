Reuters has since corrected this to South Korea.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "Myanmar,South Korea,United Nations", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/north-korea-gives-us-300-000-for-myanmar-in-first-financial-aid-since-2005-15033088", "Source": "google"}
