Some were shot dead by KNDO forces but others were killed by shelling from government forces, he said.On Wednesday, however, the Karen National Union issued a statement saying it would form a team to investigate the incident, stating that the group “follows the Geneva Convention which does not condone the killing of civilians during armed conflict.”The statement added that action could be taken to prosecute any wrongdoing according to relevant laws, without providing specifics.The U.N. statement called for “those responsible for human rights violations to be held accountable, including the perpetrators and their chain of command.”Tuesday’s burning of Kinma village in the Magway Region of central Myanmar was also a matter of dispute.A resident of the village confirmed to The Associated Press accounts in independent media that government troops were responsible for burning down most of the village’s roughly 250 houses, and that an elderly couple unable or unwilling to flee with the rest of the villagers were believed to have perished in the blaze. The villager spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals by the government.Government-controlled media, however, reported that “terrorists” were responsible for the conflagration, charging that they had burned down the home of someone unsympathetic to their cause, and that the wind had then spread the fire.The government and its opponents each refer to the other side as “terrorists.”U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres “is deeply concerned and disturbed” by the reports of government forces burning down villages in Kinma, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.This “reminds us of the systematic burning of villages in North Rakhime state, which we saw in the past and which led to the dramatic exodus of the Rohingya people,” Dujarric said.“The Secretary-General continues to strongly condemn the continued repression by the security forces against civilians across the country, which again is having major regional ramifications and requires a unified international response,” Dujarric said.Noting the discovery of the two mass graves, Dujarric said the United Nations calls on all parties to ensure that international human rights standards are respected including minimizing harm to civilians and civilian infrastructure and prohibiting collective punishment against communities, families or individuals.The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/un-alarmed-by-abuse-of-civilians-in-myanmar-conflict/2021/06/17/c6e8d606-cf93-11eb-a224-bd59bd22197c_story.html", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
