Recovery works for the second wreck are nearing completion.In an interview with The Straits Times on Monday about the historic finds, Dr Flecker said various Chinese ceramics formed a majority of the haul from the first wreck, with some matching those previously excavated in mainland Singapore.Ceramics from the wreck are also similar to those excavated at Empress Place in 2015, and more research will be done to improve existing knowledge on maritime trading history in the region during the 14th century.Dr Flecker, who has more than 30 years of maritime archaeology experience, added that the Yuan dynasty blue-and-white ceramic haul from the first wreck is also the largest that has been recovered from a shipwreck to date.\"There's been only three other (wreck) sites with Yuan blue-and-white porcelain anywhere in the world, and in much smaller quantities,\" he said, adding that it was clear from the primary cargo of both vessels - Chinese ceramics - that they were loaded in China.The Shah Munchah wreck site yielded a much wider range of artefacts, from instruments to cannon.The heaviest finds were four anchors - as long as 5m and weighing 2.5 tonnes each - and nine cannon, which required a crane vessel to remove them from the seabed.\nA diver holds a bowl decorated with Chinese characters, recovered from the deep - part of a trove of items found in Singapore waters off Pedra Branca from two shipwrecks, one with cargo dating to as early as the 14th century. Among the items were the largest haul from a shipwreck of blue-and-white ceramics from the Yuan dynasty. The first wreck was discovered after commercial divers carrying out unrelated salvage works stumbled upon several ceramic plates, which they passed to the ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute as they bore an uncanny resemblance to artefacts they had seen in the news. The institute dated the plates to the 14th century, and this kick-started an excavation project in 2016, the National Heritage Board (NHB) and ISEAS said yesterday. A survey of the area around Pedra Branca in 2019 revealed the second wreck, identified as the India-built merchant vessel Shah Munchah, which sank in 1796. The two historical shipwrecks are the first to be found in Singapore's waters, and will contribute to a better understanding of the nation's maritime past.
