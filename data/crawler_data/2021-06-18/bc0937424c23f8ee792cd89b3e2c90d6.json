In just a few years Apple Daily was printing 400,000 copies a day. Lai also opened up a Taiwan edition.Much like the rest of the print media, its circulation has crumbled in recent years -- to around 80,000 daily copies in Hong Kong.Apple Daily has struggled to successfully monetise online content, with Lai writing cheques to keep the paper afloat.But it remained a voice of defiance as local media increasingly began to self-censor and avoid taking on China's leaders directly.As Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement gathered steam from 2014 onwards, Lai became public enemy number one to Beijing, with state media routinely describing him as a \"traitor\" and a \"black hand\".Apple Daily's support for the huge and often violent democracy protests that rocked Hong Kong in 2019 infuriated Beijing further, as did Lai campaigning for international sanctions.Lai and Apple Daily's editorials were also vocal in support of former US president Donald Trump's confrontations with China.- 'See you in prison' -Beijing's imposition of a sweeping national security law last year radically changed the paper's fortunes.Lai, 73, was among the first high-profile democracy activists arrested under the law.He was jailed for attending protests, and faces a national security charge of collusion that could land him a life sentence.In an interview with AFP almost exactly a year ago, shortly before the law came in, he predicted it would be used to silence his newspaper.\"Whatever we write, whatever we say, can be subversion, can be sedition,\" he said.On Thursday, five Apple Daily executives were arrested under the same charge and some of its assets were frozen.A large number of items including 38 computers used by reporters were seized by police, Apple Daily said.\"They took away my computer,\" a reporter, who declined to be named, told AFP, adding that staff were rattled.\"No one knows where the red line is,\" he said. \"But for now I will continue my work as long as I can.\"A features reporter, who gave her surname Chan, said gallows humour had descended over the newsroom in recent months.\"We often made dark jokes like 'See you in prison'\", she told AFP.But she too vowed to plough on.\"If they really ban us, then we will remain a witness to history and will keep writing until the end.\"su-yan/jta/legIsraeli jets launched air strikes on Gaza overnight Thursday to Friday after militants in the Palestinian territory again set off incendiary balloons into southern Israel, the army and AFP journalists said.Rafael Nadal and Naomi Osaka, with 24 Grand Slam titles between them, both withdrew from Wimbledon on Thursday with the Spanish star also pulling out of the Tokyo Olympics in a bid \"to prolong my career\".Guided by MIT faculty, gain practical knowledge to embrace blockchain as a business tool.A spiked drink, a puff of dust, missing memories, and an empty bank account.Beijing said on Wednesday it did not fear the relationship between the United States and the European Union after the two sides announced they would set up a body to write economic rules and take other steps to face rising competition from China.
