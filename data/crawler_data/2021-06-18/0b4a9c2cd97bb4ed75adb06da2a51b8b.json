I would not give him all he's looking for - international recognition\".The White House says it is now pursuing \"a calibrated practical approach\" - diplomatic jargon, it seems, for being realistically low-key, while open-minded.\"We understand where previous efforts in the past had difficulties and we've tried to learn from those,\" a senior White House official said.Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.SPH Digital News / Copyright Â© 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
