Will the Danes make headlines or will we see another routine victory for the Belgians? Our money is on the second choice.Denmark have a strong squad besides Christian Eriksen: Braithwaite, Dolberg, Hojbjerg, Poulsen, Delaney, Kjaer, Christensen, Westergaard and Schmeichel. But unfortunately, this set of players wasn’t enough to defeat the Finns, who lost 0-1. The Danes were memorable for their 22 shots on goal and 70% possession. The Finns, on the other hand, needed just one attack to take away the three points. This was made possible by the unreliable play of Kasper Schmeichel. It is worth recalling that, one week before the Euro, the Danes managed to draw with the Germans 1-1. Therefore, we cannot rule out miracles in this team’s performance.We didn’t see the full extent of Belgium’s brilliance because of the generosity of the Russian defenders, especially Andrei Semyonov. Romelu Lukaku and Thomas Meunier took advantage of it, as he replaced the injured Timothy Castagne in the first half. In total, it was a 3-0 win. The Belgians will now face Denmark, whom they defeated in the last round of the Nations League. Roberto Martinez will certainly have to put a lot of effort into preparing and analysing his opponent.We believe that Belgium must win again beautifully. Moreover, the tournament has just begun, and it is too early for the Belgians to relax. That is why our bet on the match is Belgium’s victory for 2.11. We also think that goals will be scored by both sides, as the Danes will fight for the win doubly for Christian Eriksen and recovery from the loss to the Finns. Therefore, we suggest betting on Both To Score - Yes for 1.98.\nIn conclusion, we are confident that Romelu Lukaku will score another goal at the Euro. He is in the unstoppable form right now, so we are waiting for the continuation. Marathonbet gives odds of 2.25 for his goal.\nAll materials on this site are available under license Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International.
