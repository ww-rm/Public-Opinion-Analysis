Airlines in Asia, however, face being left behind in their recovery as countries in the West, led by the US and Europe, relax travel rules sooner.Cathay’s business, meanwhile, remains severely hobbled. In April, it operated 96.4 per cent fewer flights than its pre-pandemic norm.Hong Kong’s flag carrier was saved by a HK$39 billion (US$5 billion) government-led bailout this time last year, and in October, the airline cut 5,900 jobs – many of which came from Cathay Dragon.The airline has since continued to shrink its workforce.In April, it offered voluntary redundancy to pilots, cabin crew and other staff, and closed down foreign pilot bases in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Germany, affecting 280 jobs. Many office staff members have resigned in recent months too, sources said.Traditionally, the airline has relied heavily on foreign pilots – many of whom have secured permanent residency in Hong Kong over the years.A concern group for former Cathay Dragon employees on Thursday blasted the government’s decision to renew expat pilots’ work visas, saying the move was a slap in the face to unemployed aviators with permanent residency.As of the end of last year, Cathay Pacific employed 3,100 pilots and around 8,750 cabin crew. However, it is unclear how many cabin crew would be affected by the latest decision.Given its skeleton schedule, the airline was already dealing with a large surplus of cabin crew amid a slower-than-expected recovery. The long-haul flight market is not expected to return to pre-pandemic levels until 2024.Cathay pilots, while still underutilised, are busier, with many being moved to freighter planes as the air cargo business has boomed, blunting the impact of the collapse in passenger travel.
