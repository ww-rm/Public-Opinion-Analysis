A museum near the city of Chengdu bought the pig for 3,008 yuan (about £335) and kept it as a tourist attraction while it lived out its days.It succumbed to “old age and exhaustion” on Wednesday night, the museum said on China’s Weibo platform.In human terms, Zhu Jianqiang was 100 years old, the Global Times said, citing its breeder.It was named China’s animal of the year in 2008 because it “vividly illustrated the spirit of never giving up”.By midday on Thursday the Weibo hashtag “strong pig died” had drawn nearly 300m views. Weibo users hailed it as “the most famous pig in history”.“It is indeed a strong animal, not just for surviving the earthquake but also for the 13 years of life afterwards,” said one Weibo post.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/17/china-mourns-passing-of-heroic-pig-that-survived-2008-quake", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
