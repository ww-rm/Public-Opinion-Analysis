Uefa would not directly fine players, he added.\"We are never fining a player directly from the Uefa side, we do this always through the participating national association and they can look if they go further,\" said Kallen.The Uefa official did not however rule out punishments if there are further cases.\"We have regulations signed by the participating federations.
