I would not give him all he's looking for - international recognition\".The White House says it is now pursuing \"a calibrated practical approach\" - diplomatic jargon, it seems, for being realistically low-key, while open-minded.\"We understand where previous efforts in the past had difficulties and we've tried to learn from those,\" a senior White House official said.North Korea has carried out six atomic bomb tests since 2006. It is under multiple sets of international sanctions for its banned weapons programmes.A report from US intelligence experts released in April said North Korea could resume nuclear tests this year as a way to force Biden's administration to return to the negotiating table.Kim \"may take a number of aggressive and potentially destabilising actions to reshape the regional security environment and drive wedges between the United States and its allies -- up to and including the resumption of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) testing,\" said the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "North Korea,Kim Jong Un,Joe Biden,news and politics,confrontation,US", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/kim-jong-un-north-korea-prepare-for-dialogue-confrontation-us-15038136", "Source": "google"}
