Addressing a meeting of senior leaders, Mr Kim said: \"The people's food situation is now getting tense\". He said the agricultural sector had failed to meet its grain targets due to typhoons last year, which caused flooding.There are reports that food prices have spiked, with NK News reporting that a kilogram of bananas costs $45 (Â£32).North Korea has closed its borders to contain the spread of Covid-19. Trade with China has plummeted as a result. North Korea relies on China for food, fertiliser and fuel. North Korea is also struggling under international sanctions, imposed because of its nuclear programmes. The authoritarian leader of the single-party state talked about the food situation at the ruling Workers' Party central committee which started this week in the capital Pyongyang.During the meeting, Mr Kim said that national industrial output had grown by a quarter compared to the same period last year.Officials were expected to discuss relations with the US and South Korea during the event but no details have been released yet.In April, Mr Kim made a a rare admission of looming hardship, calling on officials to \"wage another, more difficult 'Arduous March' in order to relieve our people of the difficulty, even a little\".The Arduous March is a term used by North Korea officials to refer to the country's struggle during the 1990s famine, when the fall of the Soviet Union left North Korea without crucial aid. The total number of North Koreans who starved to death at the time is not known, but estimates range up to three million.It is highly unusual for Kim Jong-un to publicly acknowledge a food shortage. But this is a North Korean leader who has already admitted that his economic plan has failed. The problem for Mr Kim is that when he took over from his father, he promised his people a more prosperous future. He said they would have meat on their tables and access to electricity. This has not happened. Now he's having to prime the population for more hard work. He is trying to tie this into the global pandemic, and state media reported that he pointed out to party officials that the situation across the world is getting \"worse and worse\". With so little access to outside information, he can paint a picture of things being bad everywhere - not just in sealed off North Korea. He also described efforts to beat Covid-19 as a \"protracted war\". That signals that border closures are not easing any time soon. That is the concern of many aid organisations. The sealed border has prevented some food and medicine getting through. Most NGOs have had to leave the country, unable to get staff and supplies in or out.Pyongyang has always called for \"self-reliance\". It has closed itself off, just as it may need assistance and it is unlikely to ask for help. If it continues to push away all offers of international assistance, as ever, it may be the people who pay the price.
