Denmark have yet to earn a point and will need to win their final game against Russia and hope it is enough to get them through.Both sides’ fans and players participated in a tribute to Eriksen before kick-off as a giant Denmark shirt with the player’s name and No. 10 was displayed on the pitch.The two teams then stopped for a moment’s applause in the 10th minute and the Danish crowd unfurled a banner saying: “All of Denmark is with you Christian”.Denmark came alive in the atmosphere and pounced on a poor pass from Belgium’s Jason Denayer which allowed Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg to feed Poulsen, who fired into the bottom corner.It was the second fastest goal in European Championship history, only trailing Dmitri Kirichenko’s for Russia against Greece in Euro 2004 after 67 seconds.With 25,000 fans raising the roof at the Parken Stadium, Denmark continued to overwhelm their more illustrious opponents with rapid, direct attacks and should have added to their lead.Joakim Maehle shuffled through the area to get close to goal before Belgium goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois swiped the ball from his feet while Mikkel Damsgaard cut into the area and curled a shot just wide of the far post.Belgium made the Danes pay for not increasing their lead.Romelu Lukaku burst down the right hand side to take out two defenders and pass to de Bruyne, who showed remarkable poise to play in Hazard to score.The Manchester City midfielder, who missed the start of the tournament with a facial injury, then provided an unstoppable finish as his side’s superior talent shone through. – REUTERSGet The New Paper on your phone with the free TNP app. Download from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store now", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.tnp.sg/sports/football/euro-2020-kevin-de-bruyne-inspires-comeback-belgium-reach-last-16", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
