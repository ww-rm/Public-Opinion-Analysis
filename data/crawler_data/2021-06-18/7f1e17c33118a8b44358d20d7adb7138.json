{"Type": "", "Time": "2021-06-18", "Headline": "Netherlands vs Austria EURO 2020 Odds, Tips & Prediction│17 JUNE 2021", "Text": "\nOne of the matches in the second round of the Euro 2020 group stage will be between the Netherlands and Austria. Both teams have played well in the first round and approach the encounter with three points each. The Oranje are the favourites, probably not only because of their stronger squad but also because of the field factor.Before the start of the European Championship, the head coach of the Netherlands national team gave an interview in which he said that the Dutch team will beat the Ukrainians and Austrians, but whether they should beat the team of Northern Macedonia after that one should think, considering the options of a possible opponent in the play-offs. Frankly, it’s a bit strange to hear the head coach say that, even if only for ethical reasons. At the same time, Frank de Boer turned out to be right. The Netherlands did beat the Ukraine national team, though not 3-1, as the Oranje coach wised up, but 3-2. We will see if de Boer’s prediction about the result against the Austrians holds.Before the friendlies that the Austrian national team played before Euro 2020, Das Team could be described as a prolific team. 2-2 against the Scots, 3-1 over the Faroe Islands and 0-4 against Denmark. The first match at Euro 2020 only confirmed the fact that the Austrian team should be classified as a merry team. The Austrians beat the team of Northern Macedonia 3-1. Given the Austrians’ fairly good output and the fact that the Netherlands regularly concede from more or less strong teams, we hope that the upcoming game will be rich in goals.Austria have been unable to beat the Netherlands since 1984. And the last five head-to-head encounters between these teams have all ended in victories for the Netherlands. Based on these statistics, it comes as no surprise that the Oranje are quoted as such big favourites for the upcoming encounter. That said, we have little doubt that Austria will score at least once in Amsterdam. Accordingly, the Oranje will have to score at least twice to win. Here are our picks for the game: W1 and Total Over 1.5 for 1.88, W1 and Both To Score for 3.15, Total Over 2.5 and Both To Score for 2.10.All materials on this site are available under license Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International.
