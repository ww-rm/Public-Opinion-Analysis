Once a project is carried out, such as a school, how could it be guaranteed that a teacher would want to settle in a remote region? Why build infrastructure which after completion is likely to be destroyed by local militias?\"The B3W needs to resonate with leaders in developing countries,\" said Matthew Goodman and Jonathan Hillman, experts at the Center for Strategic International Studies, adding that \"many will be eager to expand their options, and the B3W brand could carry prestige as a high-quality effort\".In return, however, the countries will have to accept more control, higher costs and longer lead times.Finally, the big question remains what role the IMF and World Bank, institutions historically at the heart of development, will take.In order to remain relevant, they will have to be involved, while simultaneously managing the competing interests of their donors.The IMF and World Bank, which did not respond for a request for comment, could become \"a battleground for influence, as the G7 and China try to mold these institutions' lending patterns in alignment with their own economic and geopolitical interests,\" Prasad said.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "MainKeyWord": "G7,Beijing,business and finance,infrastructure,China,B3W", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "URL": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/g7-global-infrastructure-plan-faces-obstacles-as-chinese-alternative-15028840", "Source": "google"}
