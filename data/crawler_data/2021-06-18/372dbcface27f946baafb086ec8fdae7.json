But even if I do, I still won't disclose any details publicly because when I did so in the past, I didn't feel like I got a lot of blessings [from people].\"With a chuckle, Cecilia said the more she shared, the more people found things to criticise and they weren't happy for her.Sheren agreed, pointing out that people tend to make a mountain out of a molehill when such private affairs are shared.\"So since I opened myself up in the past and shared my joy with people and they created a mess, I wouldn't want to share anything with them again, even if they do find out somehow,\" she said.Cecilia was in a high-profile relationship with actor-chef Nicholas Tse and they even got married in September 2006. The couple has two sons — Lucas and Quintus.However, both Cecilia and Nicholas agreed to a divorce in 2011 and the latter is now romantically linked to Hong Kong singer Faye Wong.As for Cecilia, she gave birth to a third son in 2018 but has yet to reveal who the father is.Guess we'll never know at this rate.bryanlim@asiaone.com", "Section": "", "Writers": "", "URL": "https://www.asiaone.com/entertainment/cecilia-cheung-picky-partners-and-heres-why-she-wont-reveal-about-love-life-relationships", "MainKeyWord": "", "AdditionalKeyWord": "", "Source": "google"}
