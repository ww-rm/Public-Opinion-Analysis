2021-06-14,AstraZeneca COVID-19 shots have good risk-benefit profile for over-60s: EMA official.,"milan: the head of the eu drug regulator's covid-19 task force said on sunday that astrazeneca's coronavirus vaccine had a favourable risk-benefit profile for all age groups and particularly for those aged over 60. italian newspaper la stampa earlier quoted european medicines agency (ema) task force chief marco cavaleri as saying countries should avoid giving the vaccine to people aged over 60 in addition to younger age groups, amid fears over very rare blood clotting and as alternative vaccines become available. ""unfortunately my words have not been interpreted correctly in a recent interview with la stampa,"" cavaleri said in a statement to reuters.  the astrazeneca shot ""maintains a favourable benefit-risk profile in all ages but particularly in the elderly above 60"", he said. the ema's position is that the astrazeneca shot is safe and can be used for all age groups over 18.  however several european union member states have stopped administering it to people below a certain age, usually ranging from 50 to 65, restricting its use to older people, due to very rare cases of blood clotting, mainly among young people. on sunday evening, la stampa changed the headline on its article online and added a clarification with cavaleri's later comments to its article.  la stampa editor massimo giannini said he had no further comment. earlier this week the italian government said it would restrict the use of the astrazeneca vaccine to people aged over 60, after a teenager who had received the shot died from a rare form of blood clotting. italian health minister roberto speranza told reporters on sunday that italy will continue to use the astrazeneca vaccine on the over 60s, including those who have not received a first jab. like many european countries, italy briefly halted astrazeneca inoculations in march over concerns about the rare blood clotting problems. it resumed them the following month with the recommendation that the product be ""preferably"" used for people over the age of 60, after the ema said its benefits outweighed any risks. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

(bloomberg) the skyrocketing price of shipping goods across the globe may hit your pocketbook sooner than you think from that cup of coffee you get each morning to the toys you were thinking of buying your kids. transporting a 40-foot steel container of cargo by sea from shanghai to rotterdam now costs a record us$10,522, a whopping 547 per cent higher than the seasonal average over the last five years, according to drewry shipping. with upwards of 80 per cent of all goods trade transported by sea, freight-cost surges are threatening to boost the price of everything from toys, furniture and car parts to coffee, sugar and anchovies, compounding concerns in global markets already bracing for accelerating inflation. ""in 40 years in toy retailing i have never known such challenging conditions from the point of view of pricing,"" gary grant, the founder and executive chairman of the uk toy shop the entertainer, said in a interview.  he has had to stop importing giant teddy bears from china because their retail price would have had to double to add in higher freight costs.  ""will this have an impact on retail prices? my answer has to be yes. ""a confluence of factors soaring demand, a shortage of containers, saturated ports and too few ships and dock workers have contributed to the squeeze on transportation capacity on every freight path.  recent covid outbreaks in asian export hubs like china have made matters worse.  the pain is most acutely felt on longer-distance routes, making shipping from shanghai to rotterdam 67 per cent more expensive than to the us west coast, for instance. often dismissed as having an insignificant impact on inflation because they were a tiny part of the overall expense, rising shipping costs are now forcing some economists to pay them a bit more attention.  although still seen as a relatively minor input, hsbc holdings estimates that a 205 per cent increase in container shipping costs over the past year could raise euro-area producer prices by as much as 2 per cent. at the retail level, vendors are faced with three choices: halt trade, raise prices or absorb the cost to pass it on later, all of which would effectively mean more expensive goods, said jordi espin, strategic relations manager at the european shippers' council, a brussels-based trade group that represents about 100,000 retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers. ""these costs are already being passed to consumers,"" he said. prices for customers are rising in other ways, too.  for instance, anchovies from peru have largely stopped being imported into europe because with the higher freight costs they're not competitive relative to what's available locally, espin said.  also, european olive growers can no longer afford to export to the us, he said. meanwhile, shipping bottlenecks and costs are hurting the transport of arabica coffee beans, favoured by starbucks, and robusta beans used to make instant coffee, which are largely sourced from asia. few industry observers expect container rates to retreat much any time soon.  lars jensen, ceo of consultant vespucci maritime in copenhagen, said on a flexport webinar last week that there's ""zero slack in the system. ""closely held french shipping company cma cgm sa, which raked in net income of us$2. 1 billion in the first quarter compared with us$48 million in the year-ago period, indicated recently that it expects ""sustained demand for the transportation of consumer goods"" to continue throughout the year. freight costs are more painful for companies that move clunky, low-value items like toys and furniture.  ""if they are bulky products it means you can't get very many in the container and that will have a significant impact on the landed price of the goods,"" said the entertainer's grant. for some lower-value furniture makers, freight now makes up about 62 per cent of the retail value, according to alan murphy, ceo of consultant sea-intelligence in copenhagen. ""you simply can't survive on this,"" he said.  ""someone is bleeding very hard. ""companies are desperately trying to work around the higher costs.  some have stopped exporting to certain locations while others are looking for goods or raw materials from nearer locations, according to philip damas, founder and operational head of drewry supply chain advisors. ""the longer these extreme shipping freight rates last, the more companies will take structural measures to shorten their supply chains,"" damas said.  ""few companies can absorb a 15 per cent increase in total delivered costs for internationally traded products. "" some firms in europe are resorting to extreme methods, like using truck convoys to get products including automotive parts, bikes and scooters from china, said espin at the european shippers' council. central bankers have so far been sanguine about the phenomenon, arguing that the rise in consumer prices tied to supply hiccups won't last.  european central bank president christine lagarde said on june 10 that while supply-chain bottlenecks would push up production prices and the headline inflation rate is expected to rise further in the second half of this year, the effect will fade. several factors explain the relative lack of concern.  shipping costs only constitute a small fraction of the final price of a manufactured good, with economists at goldman sachs group estimating in march when china-europe rates were about half of current levels that internationally they made up less than 1 per cent. to top that, companies have annual contracts with the container lines, so the prices they've locked in are considerably lower than the headline-grabbing spot rates.  although the latest round of contract negotiations in may reflected the stronger spot market, hsbc trade economist shanella rajanayagam said that ""the longer-term rates are much much lower than the spot rates, even if they are feeding through. ""with the end of lockdowns consumer demand is likely to shift to services from goods, but ""the risk of course is that higher shipping costs persist especially given ongoing shipping disruption and that producers become more willing to pass these higher costs on to consumers,"" rajanayagam said. while many economists note that even a full pass-through of higher shipping fares to consumers will have a marginal effect on headline inflation, volker wieland, a professor of economics at the goethe university in frankfurt and a member of the german government's council of economic advisers, warns that they might not be sufficiently factored in. ""even if the order of magnitude is smaller than estimated, the dynamic builds over a year and has significant effects,"" he said.  ""that means there's a danger we're underestimating the impact.

2021-06-14,"Rolls-Royce Ghost Extended review: A luxurious experience unlike any other, Lifestyle News.","the rolls-royce ghost extended is a masterpiece of engineering with its impressive power, immense comfort, and innovative technology providing you with a luxurious experience unlike any other. when the original ghost debuted in 2009, it had a mixed reception.  some argued that it was not a proper rolls royce, conceived as the ""baby version"" of the phantom.  however, the model soon attracted a loyal customer base, and has gone on to become rolls-royce's most successful model in the marque's 116-year history. wanting to raise the bar and meet the demands of their customers, this new second generation ghost was curated with direct feedback from rolls-royce's existing customer base.  the company spared no expense in engineering a car that is dynamic, extremely comfortable and minimalistic at the same time.  what they ended up with, is nothing short of brilliant. the new ghost extended is completely hand-built from the ground up, using a new proprietary aluminium spaceframe that gave designers the freedom to create a truly bespoke car. the first thing you'll immediately notice when you approach the car is the sheer size.  the new rolls-royce ghost comes in two variants: the standard model comes in at 5. 5metres long, while this extended version stretches that to 5. 7metres. to put that into perspective, a regular toyota altis is only 4. 5metres long, thus making the ghost feel like an actual yacht on the road. even though the ghost extended is ridiculously long, the new 'post opulent' design theme and sharp bow lines give this car a sleek and modern look. upfront, the spirit of ecstasy sits elegantly on the front bonnet.  a showpiece that symbolises speed with silence, the hood ornament is virtually impossible to steal, retracting into the car as soon as it senses that someone is tampering with it. the width of the car has also been increased by 30mm.  combined with the angular headlights, this gives the ghost extended an assertive yet beautiful front end. moving to the sides, a single stroke is used to provide depth to the silhouette of the car.  the car sits on big 21-inch wheels, bearing the rolls-royce logo that always remains upright while the vehicle is in motion, a feature on all modern rolls-royce vehicles. 100 kilograms of acoustic damping materials are used throughout the car, and some are even incorporated into the tyres, ensuring the quietest ride possible. the roofline slowly tapers off towards the rear, with squarish tail lights that have been modernised to fit the new design profile. the boot is massive, with a volume of 500 litres.  this means that whatever you're carrying, be it golf bags or luggage, can easily fit in the rear. like the previous generation, the car has rear suicide doors.  with power-assisted functionality included, it enables passengers to effortlessly open and closes the doors without needing to use any kind of force. the iconic rolls-royce umbrellas are embedded within each rear door.  these special umbrellas are coated with teflon, and when stowed inside the doors, air can be channelled through to dry them, ready for their next use. when designing the new ghost extended, rolls-royce envisioned a car that was not only predominantly chauffeur-driven, but a vehicle that also enabled its customers to drive with confidence.  as such, much of the interior is very driver-centric. instead of going all out with modern technology like most other manufacturers, the designers chose to integrate technology into their signature traditional designs, resulting in a ""retro-modern"" feel that looks gorgeous. the gauge cluster is one good example, with digital tachometers placed within analogue metal frames.  most of the buttons in the car are physical too, a welcome sight in an industry where most car features are now toggled via touchscreens. speaking of touchscreens, the ghost extended does come with a very responsive centre console touchscreen. an all-new illuminated fascia is also mounted on the passenger side dashboard.  crafted with 152 leds and crafted with more than 90,000 laser-etched dots across the surface, it illuminates while the vehicle is in operation, giving out what the rolls-royce designers call a ""post opulent"" feel to the cabin. moving on to the rear, you'll enter a cocoon of lush and very expensive materials.  all of the leather in a rolls-royce are sourced from cattle raised at high altitudes and are subjected to the automotive industry's most exhaustive quality control checks, ensuring that only the best ends up in the cars. similar to the illuminated fascia at the front, the roof lining is also fitted with rolls-royce's signature starlight headliner.  over 1000 individual leds are hand-woven into the custom roof liner, and can be toggled to give the cabin the ambience of a beautiful night sky. upon request, rolls-royce can even produce custom star constellations that only appear on your birthday, or shooting stars that cross the cabin at random intervals. the rear legroom is fantastic, thanks to the extra 170mm of length which starts from behind the b-pillars of the ghost extended. once seated, two gigantic screens can be deployed from the front seats, allowing rear passengers to enjoy multimedia entertainment such as movies or even satellite television.  the screens also come with hdmi connectivity, allowing passengers to connect things such as laptops or gaming consoles. also read: rolls-royce creates 'most refined picnic facility on earth'there is one downside to this car; the rear screens are only 720p resolution.  in a world where high-definition screens are commonplace, you can notice a slight difference in quality when browsing content.  however, i'm sure with the seemingly limitless customisation that rolls-royce offers, fitting better screens should be no issue. the most impressive feature of the cabin by far is the sound system.  a powerful amplifier controls 18 speakers.  additionally, the design of certain elements of the car, such as the door sills and materials used across the cabin, help to create an enclosed resonance audio chamber.  the result? a cabin with near cinema-grade acoustics.  it is truly an experience unlike any other. oh, did i mention that each seat in the cabin also comes with heating and ventilation, as well as massage functionality? of course, the ghost extended has it all. client feedback asking for near-instant torque led engineers to further develop the rolls-royce 6. 75-litre twin-turbocharged v12 petrol engine.  this new engine profile is unique to the ghost, delivering 563bhp and a whopping 850nm/627lb-ft of torque.  maximum torque is available from just 1600rpm. this enables the car to accelerate from 0-100km/h in just 4. 8 seconds, a massive feat considering the ghost extended weighs over 2. 5tonnes.  why someone would want to do that in a rolls-royce is beyond me, but the car is able to do it if you so wish. the satellite-aided 8-speed automatic transmission pre-selects gears based on the behaviour of the driver and its location geographically, ensuring the smoothest ride possible in any condition.  power is delivered effortlessly to all four wheels, with the ghost now being offered with all-wheel drive as well as all-wheel steering. our resident host jackie had the esteemed opportunity to test drive the new ghost extended.  in his words, he summed up the car as ""driving a cloud with wheels"".  it has an extremely refined drive, and nothing else comes close.  even though the steering is light, there is still good road feedback while driving. the two things that surprised him the most were the power delivery and handling.  the ghost extended looks gentle, until he puts his foot down.  obviously, the acceleration is not as brutal as traditional sports cars, but the power does come quickly, and he could overtake other vehicles on the road with ease. in a car that is as heavy as the ghost extended, it truly is amazing. handling on the other hand is where the car really shines.  the ghost extended now comes with what rolls-royce dubs the planar suspension system.  this extensive suspension assembly works alongside the flagbearer system, which uses cameras to read the road conditions ahead and prepares the suspension system for any changes. all of these features enable the car to handle corners with ease.  the team expected the car to have lots of body roll, but it was civilised through the corners.  it grips well to the road, and the suspension system ironed out virtually everything that crossed the ghost's path. the rolls-royce ghost extended, the ultimate gentlemen's entourage.  of course, with such insane features, this car has to have a ridiculous price tag.  starting at $1. 2 million for the regular ghost and $1. 5 million for the extended variant, it's not a sum most people can pull out of their left pocket at any time. plus, with the limitless number of options available for each rolls-royce, you'll start to see the price skyrocket.  this example that we tested is on sale for a cool $1. 95 million, and even rolls-royce claims this is still a ""base model"". however, if you're a person that spares no expense when it comes to the finer things in life, and you are able to glance past (and afford) the hefty price tag, then this car is a definite must-have. also read: rolls-royce creates its latest phantom collection

rolls-royce ghost extended is a masterpiece of engineering with its impressive power, immense comfort, and innovative technology providing you with a luxurious experience unlike any other.', 'when the original ghost debuted in 2009, it had a mixed reception.', 'some argued that it was not a proper rolls royce, conceived as the ""baby version"" of the phantom.', ""however, the model soon attracted a loyal customer base, and has gone on to become rolls-royce's most successful model in the marque's 116-year history."", ""wanting to raise the bar and meet the demands of their customers, this new second generation ghost was curated with direct feedback from rolls-royce's existing customer base."", 'the company spared no expense in engineering a car that is dynamic, extremely comfortable and minimalistic at the same time.', 'what they ended up with, is nothing short of brilliant.', 'the new ghost extended is completely hand-built from the ground up, using a new proprietary aluminium spaceframe that gave designers the freedom to create a truly bespoke car.', ""the first thing you'll immediately notice when you approach the car is the sheer size."", 'the new rolls-royce ghost comes in two variants: the standard model comes in at 5.', '5metres long, while this extended version stretches that to 5.', '7metres.', 'to put that into perspective, a regular toyota altis is only 4.', '5metres long, thus making the ghost feel like an actual yacht on the road.', ""even though the ghost extended is ridiculously long, the new 'post opulent' design theme and sharp bow lines give this car a sleek and modern look."", 'upfront, the spirit of ecstasy sits elegantly on the front bonnet.', 'a showpiece that symbolises speed with silence, the hood ornament is virtually impossible to steal, retracting into the car as soon as it senses that someone is tampering with it.', 'the width of the car has also been increased by 30mm.', 'combined with the angular headlights, this gives the ghost extended an assertive yet beautiful front end.', 'moving to the sides, a single stroke is used to provide depth to the silhouette of the car.', 'the car sits on big 21-inch wheels, bearing the rolls-royce logo that always remains upright while the vehicle is in motion, a feature on all modern rolls-royce vehicles.', '100 kilograms of acoustic damping materials are used throughout the car, and some are even incorporated into the tyres, ensuring the quietest ride possible.', 'the roofline slowly tapers off towards the rear, with squarish tail lights that have been modernised to fit the new design profile.', 'the boot is massive, with a volume of 500 litres.', ""this means that whatever you're carrying, be it golf bags or luggage, can easily fit in the rear."", 'like the previous generation, the car has rear suicide doors.', 'with power-assisted functionality included, it enables passengers to effortlessly open and closes the doors without needing to use any kind of force.', 'the iconic rolls-royce umbrellas are embedded within each rear door.', 'these special umbrellas are coated with teflon, and when stowed inside the doors, air can be channelled through to dry them, ready for their next use.', 'when designing the new ghost extended, rolls-royce envisioned a car that was not only predominantly chauffeur-driven, but a vehicle that also enabled its customers to drive with confidence.', 'as such, much of the interior is very driver-centric.', 'instead of going all out with modern technology like most other manufacturers, the designers chose to integrate technology into their signature traditional designs, resulting in a ""retro-modern"" feel that looks gorgeous.', 'the gauge cluster is one good example, with digital tachometers placed within analogue metal frames.', 'most of the buttons in the car are physical too, a welcome sight in an industry where most car features are now toggled via touchscreens.', 'speaking of touchscreens, the ghost extended does come with a very responsive centre console touchscreen.', 'an all-new illuminated fascia is also mounted on the passenger side dashboard.', 'crafted with 152 leds and crafted with more than 90,000 laser-etched dots across the surface, it illuminates while the vehicle is in operation, giving out what the rolls-royce designers call a ""post opulent"" feel to the cabin.', ""moving on to the rear, you'll enter a cocoon of lush and very expensive materials."", ""all of the leather in a rolls-royce are sourced from cattle raised at high altitudes and are subjected to the automotive industry's most exhaustive quality control checks, ensuring that only the best ends up in the cars."", ""similar to the illuminated fascia at the front, the roof lining is also fitted with rolls-royce's signature starlight headliner."", 'over 1000 individual leds are hand-woven into the custom roof liner, and can be toggled to give the cabin the ambience of a beautiful night sky.', 'upon request, rolls-royce can even produce custom star constellations that only appear on your birthday, or shooting stars that cross the cabin at random intervals.', 'the rear legroom is fantastic, thanks to the extra 170mm of length which starts from behind the b-pillars of the ghost extended.', 'once seated, two gigantic screens can be deployed from the front seats, allowing rear passengers to enjoy multimedia entertainment such as movies or even satellite television.', 'the screens also come with hdmi connectivity, allowing passengers to connect things such as laptops or gaming consoles.', ""also read: rolls-royce creates 'most refined picnic facility on earth'there is one downside to this car; the rear screens are only 720p resolution."", 'in a world where high-definition screens are commonplace, you can notice a slight difference in quality when browsing content.', ""however, i'm sure with the seemingly limitless customisation that rolls-royce offers, fitting better screens should be no issue."", 'the most impressive feature of the cabin by far is the sound system.', 'a powerful amplifier controls 18 speakers.', 'additionally, the design of certain elements of the car, such as the door sills and materials used across the cabin, help to create an enclosed resonance audio chamber.', 'the result?', 'a cabin with near cinema-grade acoustics.', 'it is truly an experience unlike any other.', 'oh, did i mention that each seat in the cabin also comes with heating and ventilation, as well as massage functionality?', 'of course, the ghost extended has it all.', 'client feedback asking for near-instant torque led engineers to further develop the rolls-royce 6.', '75-litre twin-turbocharged v12 petrol engine.', 'this new engine profile is unique to the ghost, delivering 563bhp and a whopping 850nm/627lb-ft of torque.', 'maximum torque is available from just 1600rpm.', 'this enables the car to accelerate from 0-100km/h in just 4.', '8 seconds, a massive feat considering the ghost extended weighs over 2.', '5tonnes.', 'why someone would want to do that in a rolls-royce is beyond me, but the car is able to do it if you so wish.', 'the satellite-aided 8-speed automatic transmission pre-selects gears based on the behaviour of the driver and its location geographically, ensuring the smoothest ride possible in any condition.', 'power is delivered effortlessly to all four wheels, with the ghost now being offered with all-wheel drive as well as all-wheel steering.', 'our resident host jackie had the esteemed opportunity to test drive the new ghost extended.', 'in his words, he summed up the car as ""driving a cloud with wheels"".', 'it has an extremely refined drive, and nothing else comes close.', 'even though the steering is light, there is still good road feedback while driving.', 'the two things that surprised him the most were the power delivery and handling.', 'the ghost extended looks gentle, until he puts his foot down.', 'obviously, the acceleration is not as brutal as traditional sports cars, but the power does come quickly, and he could overtake other vehicles on the road with ease.', 'in a car that is as heavy as the ghost extended, it truly is amazing.', 'handling on the other hand is where the car really shines.', 'the ghost extended now comes with what rolls-royce dubs the planar suspension system.', 'this extensive suspension assembly works alongside the flagbearer system, which uses cameras to read the road conditions ahead and prepares the suspension system for any changes.', 'all of these features enable the car to handle corners with ease.', 'the team expected the car to have lots of body roll, but it was civilised through the corners.', ""it grips well to the road, and the suspension system ironed out virtually everything that crossed the ghost's path."", ""the rolls-royce ghost extended, the ultimate gentlemen's entourage."", 'of course, with such insane features, this car has to have a ridiculous price tag.', 'starting at $1.', '2 million for the regular ghost and $1.', ""5 million for the extended variant, it's not a sum most people can pull out of their left pocket at any time."", ""plus, with the limitless number of options available for each rolls-royce, you'll start to see the price skyrocket."", 'this example that we tested is on sale for a cool $1.', '95 million, and even rolls-royce claims this is still a ""base model"".', ""however, if you're a person that spares no expense when it comes to the finer things in life, and you are able to glance past (and afford) the

""long lines formed outside and inside raffles medical in shaw centre as people waited for their turn to get swabbed from 8. 30 am. on friday, the ministry of health reported that a 57-year-old woman who works as a promoter at guardian in ion had tested positive for covid-19.  she is the third worker at ion to test positive for the virus, prompting moh to close the mall and offer testing to mall visitors and staff. most of the people in the line said they were getting tested just to be safe.  others, like housewife madam aparna, 71, said she and her husband wanted to be tested for the safety of the people around them.  ""we are doing it more for the others.

2021-06-14,"G-7 commits to one billion extra Covid-19 vaccine doses , Europe News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. carbis bay, england (reuters, bloomberg) the group of seven (g-7) nations confirmed a promise to deliver at least one billion extra doses of covid-19 vaccines over the next year, even as they laid out plans to tackle any future pandemic. the vaccine pledge was the most dramatic element of the bloc's effort to work together to bring an end to the covid-19 pandemic spelled out in a joint communique issued at the end of the three-day summit.  but the grouping also cast an eye to the future. it pledged, among other things, to increase early warning systems and to shorten the cycle for the development of safe and effective vaccines from 300 days to 100. united states president joe biden said the summit had rallied the world's democracies to deliver on the challenges of the age. ""america is back at the table and fully engaged,"" he told reporters after the summit in south-west england, adding that the north atlantic treaty organisation's mutual defence was a ""sacred obligation"" and that democracies were in a ""contest with autocracies"". on a busy final day, the group of leading economies also agreed to raise contributions to meet an overdue spending pledge of us$100 billion (s$133 billion) a year by rich countries to help poorer ones cut carbon emissions and cope with global warming, but campaigners said firm cash promises were missing.  the leaders had strong words for china and russia.  the g-7 condemned russia for ""destabilising behaviour"", and called on moscow to pursue hackers carrying out ransomware attacks from its soil.  ""we reaffirm our call on russia to stop its destabilising behaviour and malign activities, including its interference in other countries' democratic systems, and to fulfil its international human rights obligations and commitments,"" the leaders said.  the g-7 cited china explicitly on human rights issues in xinjiang and hong kong, but omitted any mention of beijing in the section on forced labour practices.   the g-7 called ""on china to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, especially in relation to xinjiang, and those rights, freedoms and high degree of autonomy for hong kong enshrined in the sino-british joint declaration and the basic law"". still, the coronavirus was clearly the priority during the summit.  the communique said: ""total g-7 commitments since the start of the pandemic provide for a total of over two billion vaccine doses, with the commitments since we last met in february 2021, including here in carbis bay, providing for one billion doses over the next year. ""many of the doses will flow through covax, a global vaccine-buying system backed by the world health organisation and gavi, the vaccine alliance.  experts said the plan is a boost to covax, which has so far distributed only 83 million shots worldwide.  covax has struggled to secure deliveries as wealthy nations reserve enough shots to vaccinate their populations several times over.  ""it's going to rescue covax from its pretty dire predicament right now, so it's a very significant step,"" said mr stephen morrison, director of the global health policy centre at the centre for strategic and international studies, a think-tank. at the same time, some experts said the commitment falls far short of the five billion to six billion doses needed by poorer nations. the figure of more than two billion doses includes a much wider array of contributions already offered, as well future exports, according to a european official.  so far, the g-7 countries have promised only as many as 700 million truly new doses, funded in part by previously announced aid.  if doses already announced in recent weeks by g-7 and eu nations are included, the tally grows to 870 million doses, as the communique notes.  to reach the 1 billion figure, g-7 officials included pledges made starting back in february. the biggest batches come from countries that had cornered the market early on for domestic use.  the us and britain account for nearly all the new pledges – after they steered hundreds of millions of doses produced on their soil for their own citizens, while restricting exports for months. the pledges come as the bloc grapples with another question – whether and how to lift intellectual-property rights protections for the vaccines.  biden threw his weight behind that idea but it has languished after german chancellor angela merkel opposed it.  the communique pledged only to ""support manufacturing in low-income countries,"" but didn't say specifically how. it noted the ""importance of intellectual property"" and the ""positive impact"" of voluntary licensing – both clauses that reflect the view of countries opposed to a waiver. ""we will explore all options to ensure affordable and accessible covid-19 tools for the poorest countries,"" it said. despite some lingering resentment, the new doses pledged at the summit are a welcome sign to nations without domestic vaccine production that have been desperately awaiting shots.  the new and existing pledges include:- 500 million pfizer doses pledged by the us, for delivery beginning in august and through 2022, on top of 80 million biden previously announced;- 100 million doses pledged by britain from a mix of manufacturers;- as many as 100 million doses pledged by canada at the summit; and- 100 million doses pledged by the eu at a meeting last month, including 75 million from germany, france and italy – the eu's g-7 members. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-14,"Heart inflammation after Covid-19 jab rare, link to mRNA vaccines still unknown: Experts, Singapore News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore heart conditions associated with the covid-19 mrna vaccine are extremely rare, and it remains unclear if the vaccines are responsible for them, experts told the straits times after a handful of cases raised some concerns. six individuals here were reported to have suffered myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after getting an mrna vaccine, among whom four are young men less than 30 years old.  the other two are a man and a woman both aged above 40. the health sciences authority (hsa) said most of the cases had occurred within a few days after receiving the second dose of the vaccine, and that all have recovered or been discharged well from hospital. the united states and israel two major users of the mrna vaccines have also reported a slightly increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis in young men after the second dose of mrna vaccination. but there is no need to be overly concerned as these events are rare, experts said. professor ooi eng eong, an expert on emerging infectious diseases at duke-nus medical school, said it also remains unclear if it is indeed mrna vaccines causing these adverse events and how vaccination could have resulted in them. as at june 7, more than 1,888,000 people in singapore have received both doses of mrna vaccines by either pfizer biontech or moderna. an article on friday (june 11) by the american academy of paediatrics cited a rate of 16 cases of myocarditis/pericarditis per million second doses in people aged 16 to 39 years old. such inflammation of the heart was also reported in some covid-19 patients last year, most likely the result of an overactive immune system giving rise to the inflammation. vaccine maker moderna issued a statement on friday stating that it is aware of reports of such cases after people took its vaccine, but added that it has not established a causal association with its vaccine after carefully reviewing the available safety data to date. as mrna vaccines lead to a similar, but milder, immune response, they could also give rise to inflammation, said prof ooi. ""but these cases, if indeed caused by the vaccine, will be much fewer compared with covid-19-induced heart inflammation ones. ""it is also important to note that the occurrence of some rare events is natural for any vaccine, especially when large numbers have been vaccinated, he stressed. ""no other vaccine has come under the scrutiny as covid-19 vaccines.  in about six months, over 1. 5 billion people have been vaccinated under close observation,"" he added. he said it is unclear why young men may be more susceptible, and that it is difficult to conduct the necessary studies to determine a correlation. ""nonetheless, we can expect more detailed description of what happens to these cases in the coming months, from those that have been treated in the us and israel.  the picture may become clearer then. ""some 1. 5 million cases of myocarditis are reported worldwide a year, with population prevalence varying widely, said cardiologist chuang hsuan-hung, who practises at the asian heart & vascular centre. myocarditis is triggered by various factors and is not a distinct cardiovascular disease. its exact prevalence in singapore is not known. the hsa said that in general, five to seven individuals per 100,000 people a year are hospitalised for myocarditis or pericarditis. worldwide, viral infections are the most frequent cause of myocarditis.  other causes include drugs, autoimmune diseases and other kinds of infections, including by bacteria and parasites. although inflammation of the heart can affect all age groups, myocarditis and pericarditis do occur more often in young adults, and pericarditis more commonly affects middle-aged adults, dr chuang added. dr chuang said that enforced rest was crucial when one is recovering. dr mak koon-hou, a cardiologist at gleneagles medical centre, said young adults are more prone to these conditions as they are more likely to mount a greater inflammatory response. exercising increases the risk of myocarditis.  when a person exercises, the demand on the heart increases.  if the heart muscle is already inflamed, strenuous physical activity may worsen the amount of damage to the heart muscle, adversely affecting its function, dr mak said. ""it may result in abnormal heart rhythm and become potentially lethal. ""in general, activities such as jogging, skipping, aerobic dancing, hiking especially with a load and cycling at least 16kmh are considered strenuous activities. it is important to note how one feels and check with the doctor regarding the most suitable type and intensity of exercise, dr mak said. ""if a person feels tired, breathless, discomfort in the chest, palpitations and giddiness, it is best to stop or reduce the intensity.  heart rates are easily measured nowadays with phones and oximeters.

""some of the key ministers involved have already sat down with me to present the draft.  basically good, but not yet refined. ""it is time we want to set an exit strategy or national recovery plan for us to get out of this problem, but this is a big challenge depending on the cooperation and support of all parties,"" he said, as quoted by bernama. mr muhyiddin said the plan could help hospitals manage their capacity. ""we have to help the ministry of health manage (its) healthcare (capacity) to ensure that our healthcare system does not collapse . . .  there must be enough hospitals, bed facilities, ventilators and hospital staff,"" he said. dr adham had said in june that malaysia would be able to inoculate 80 per cent of its population and reach herd immunity by december. mr muhyiddin was speaking to reporters after visiting a mobile vaccine truck at a low cost housing project in kuala lumpur. the mobile vaccination programme is a continuation of a pilot project that took off on june 7 at another low-cost housing estate in the capital city.  the elderly and people with disabilities are given priority in the programme, which was introduced in june with an aim to inoculate 80 per cent of residents in the federal territories by the end of august.  mr muhyiddin said the government will increase the number of mobile vaccine trucks in the federal territories. separately, senior minister ismail sabri yaakob on sunday said the government could relax the current lockdown restrictions if daily covid-19 cases fall below 4,000 but it would subject to the health ministry advice. ""this does not mean the end of restrictions but perhaps reviewing the rules which can be relaxed a bit and so on.  this is because the impact will only be visible after 14 days because that is the incubation period of the virus,"" datuk seri ismail sabri was quoted by the star newspaper as saying. ""we pray after 14 days the cases go down; we can review the sop (standard operating procedure) which we think may be a little strict, but i cannot promise because it depends on the advice from the health ministry.  ""he was speaking after visiting the army field hospital at sultanah aminah hospital in johor bahru. he also acknowledged the existence of a national recovery plan, saying that it will be discussed at a special meeting in due course though herd immunity remains a priority. malaysia reported 5,304 new infections on sunday with 64 new deaths, bringing the cumulative caseload to 657,508 with 3,908 total deaths, according to the health ministry. selangor recorded the highest number of cases at 1,973, followed by sarawak (544) and kuala lumpur (462). join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-14,Biden urges G7 leaders to call out and compete with China.,"carbis bay, england: leaders of the world's largest economies unveiled an infrastructure plan saturday (jun 12) for the developing world to compete with china's global initiatives, but they were searching for a consensus on how to forcefully call out beijing over human rights abuses. citing china for its forced labour practices is part of president joe biden's campaign to persuade fellow democratic leaders to present a more unified front to compete economically with beijing.  but while they agreed to work toward competing against china, there was less unity on how adversarial a public position the group should take. canada, the united kingdom and france largely endorsed biden's position, while germany, italy and the european union showed more hesitancy during saturday's first session of the group of seven summit, according to two senior biden administration officials.  the officials who briefed reporters were not authorised to publicly discuss the private meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity. the communique that summarises the meeting's commitments was being written and the contents would not be clear until it was released when the summit ended sunday.  white house officials said late saturday that they believed that china, in some form, could be called out for ""nonmarket policies and human rights abuses"". in his first summit as president, biden made a point of carving out one-on-one-time with various leaders, bouncing from french president emmanuel macron to german chancellor angela merkel to italian prime minister mario draghi as well as japan's yoshihide suga and australia's scott morrison, a day after meeting with british prime minister boris johnson as if to personally try to ward off memories of the chaos that his predecessor would often bring to these gatherings. macron told biden that collaboration was needed on a range of issues and told the american president that ""it's great to have a us president part of the club and very willing to cooperate"".  relations between the allies had become strained during the four years of donald trump's presidency and his ""america first"" foreign policy. merkel, for her part, downplayed differences on china and the nord stream 2 pipeline which would transport natural gas from russia to germany, bypassing ukraine.

""the problem is that the goods that were supposed to have arrived in june have not,"" ms tsai told a taiwanese radio station yesterday. taiwan has ordered 10 million doses from astrazeneca, which is mainly producing the shots in thailand, she said. ""now thailand's epidemic situation is serious and they are giving priority for vaccines to be used in thailand,"" ms tsai added. thailand has reported 189,828 infections, with more than 80 per cent of the new cases and fatalities coming since april. neither astrazeneca nor thai government officials immediately responded to requests for comment. taiwan's health minister chen shih-chung told lawmakers on tuesday that orders from astrazeneca would be delayed by a month due to production problems at the firm's thai plant. taiwan received 1. 24 million astrazeneca doses donated by japan last week, and the united states has pledged 750,000 shots, but no details have been provided on that. ms tsai said the government has been having ""emergency"" talks with the us and japan to see what other vaccines they may be able to give.  the president has come under pressure to do more to speed up vaccine deliveries, and yesterday expressed apologies for the infections and deaths. mr chen told parliament that government-run research centre academia sinica has made good progress on mrna technology and contacted moderna about working with it on vaccines. moderna did not immediately respond to a request for comment. taiwan has received just 150,000 moderna doses of more than five million on order. reutersjoin st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

'adolescents and younger men' should avoid strenuous physical activity for a week after their second dose as a precaution.  — today file pic

follow us on instagram and subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates. singapore, june 13 — the expert committee for covid-19 vaccination has advised ""adolescents and younger men"" to avoid strenuous physical activity for a week after their second dose as a precaution against a ""small risk"" of heart inflammation.  they should also seek medical attention promptly if they develop chest pain, shortness of breath or abnormal heartbeats. despite this, the benefits of getting vaccinated still outweigh the risk, the committee under the ministry of health (moh) stressed in a news release late friday (june 11) night. in singapore, as of june 7, the health sciences authority (hsa) has reported four men aged 18 to 30 having myocarditis or pericarditis after they received their second jab of the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines. another two cases involved one man and one woman who are both above 40 years old, hsa added in a separate news release late friday night. these are inflammatory conditions affecting the heart muscles (myocarditis) and the outer lining of the heart (pericarditis). ""most of the cases were reported to have occurred within a few days after receiving the second dose of the vaccine,"" hsa said, adding that all the people affected have recovered or have been discharged well from hospital. more studies and investigations are ongoing on such cases, the expert committee said. its recommendation was made after an assessment of international reports showing that a higher-than-expected number of young men have experienced heart inflammation after their second dose of the vaccines that use messenger ribonucleic acid (mrna) technology. this has been observed overseas in israel and the united states in adolescents and young men under 25, the committee noted. ""the risk of this has been estimated to be 1. 6 cases per 100,000 doses for mrna vaccines in the us, which is comparable to the risk of anaphylaxis (severe allergic reactions) observed in singapore,"" it said. hsa said that the two cases in singapore of those above 40 years of age ""is within the baseline incidence rate"", while the four involving the men aged 18 to 30 ""is at the upper end of the expected range for this age group, based on background incidence rates"". both the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines approved for the national vaccination programme use mrna technology. there is no observed incremental risk of the conditions after the first dose of the vaccines, the committee said. it also said that most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis are mild. patients recover without the need for significant intervention and do not suffer any long-term effects, it added, ""although very rarely, severe cases may result in damage to the heart muscles"". these occur more often in men compared to women and are separate and distinct conditions from heart attacks, which are caused when blood flow to the heart is blocked. hsa said that globally, regulatory authorities, including those in israel and the us, continue to recommend vaccination for those aged 16 to 30 years to protect them from covid-19. the 14-member expert committee on covid-19 vaccines is chaired by associate professor benjamin ong, who is the senior adviser to the director of medical services at moh and the senior vice-president of health education and resources at the national university of singapore. the committee includes other experts in infectious diseases, immunology and other relevant fields.  — todayloading. . . © 2021, malay mail, all rights reserved.

""he had a reputation for being extremely violent, beheading captured innocent civilians and security forces alike,"" a military commander, major general william gonzales, said of yadah. yadah had also been linked to the 2015 kidnappings of four people, including two canadian tourists.  the canadians were separately beheaded by their abu sayyaf captors, including mujir yadah, a brother of injam, after a deadline for ransom payment lapsed, a military officer said. another abu sayyaf militant killed in sunday's firefight was al sawadjaan, a bomb-maker and would-be suicide bomber, according to lieutenant colonel wilfredo borgonia, an army infantry battalion commander. troops seized a rifle, a pistol, bomb parts and 15 cellphones.  they also took into custody yadah's wife and three children, the military said in a statement, adding the children were ""rescued"". sawadjaan was a younger brother of abu sayyaf commander mundi sawadjaan, the main suspect in a number of deadly suicide attacks in recent years in sulu, a predominantly muslim province where the militants have been the target of years-long military offensives. the sawadjaans belonged to an abu sayyaf faction that has pledged allegiance to the islamic state group. this year, at least 18 abu sayyaf militants have been killed, 17 captured while 86 others have surrendered in sulu, the military said. the us and the philippines have separately blacklisted the abu sayyaf as a terrorist organisation for deadly bombings, ransom kidnappings and beheadings. the brutal group has been considerably weakened by battle setbacks, surrenders and factionalism but remains a national security threat. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

""we're not too disappointed with the draw, it could have been worse,"" bale told s4c.  ""they're a top 10 team in the world, they're there for a reason so we knew in parts we would have to suffer and work hard as a team. ""the best thing for us was to go 1-0 down.  we showed a lot of character, like we always do, to fight back, be brave, get on the ball and get the equaliser. ""switzerland striker gavranovic had a potential winner chalked off by var for offside after he had edged ahead of wales back four. ""over the past year i've hated var but by now, i love it now, fair play,"" wales midfielder joe allen said. with petkovic naming a narrow back three, bale and fellow winger dan james found space out wide early on in front of an estimated 10,000 crowd as the local authorities allowed up to 50-percent capacity in the 69,000-seater olympic stadium. after a quarter of an hour played, james broke free down the left before finding the 1. 95m moore, who forced swiss goalkeeper yann sommer to tip the ball over the bar. from the resulting corner, moore rose highest again and clashed in the air with manuel akanji, which left the cardiff forward playing the remainder of the game with red tape around his head. with moore bandaged, the momentum swung towards petkovic's side and they dominated the remainder of the half but seferovic wasted three chances. moore returned after the interval despite completing just one of his team's 101 passes in the first half. petkovic's switzerland, who reached the last 16 five years ago, remained in control with captain granit xhaka, liverpool's xherdan shaqiri and atalanta's remo freuler dominating midfield. 
 they broke the deadlock four minutes into the second half as embolo sparked into life after a quiet opening 45 minutes. he broke down the middle and forced danny ward into a save, which gave shaqiri a corner on the right flank. 
he delivered to embolo who headed home after beating wales right-back connor roberts with ease for just his sixth goal in 44 international appearances. shaqiri, who played just 14 premier league games for liverpool last season, was substituted on 66 minutes for the more defensive denis zakaria. despite petkovic's pragmatic change in personnel, wales equalised with 16 minutes remaining. manchester united's james played a corner short which ended up at joe morrell's feet and he crossed into the box. moore lost his marker and headed a well-placed effort passed the out-stretched sommer to send the roughly 300 travelling wales fans into a frenzy behind the opposite goal. james was then replaced by david brooks as both sides searched for a winner. seferovic was substituted for 31-year-old gavranovic on 84 minutes and the dinamo zagreb forward thought he had claimed all three points for his side with his first touch. after edging past the wales backline he beat ward but his effort was chalked off for offside by var. switzerland pressed on in five minutes of injury time and gavranovic was denied another potential winner, this time ward saving with his finger tips. ramsey left the field for ethan ampadu during time added on and page's men held on for a point. wales stay in baku for their next game when they face turkey on wednesday, with switzerland taking on italy in rome later that day. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-14,What Putin really wants from Biden.,"by sarah rainsfordbbc news, moscowthe geneva summit between vladimir putin and joe biden on 16 june will not be a friendly encounter.  for a start, russia recently included the us on its official list of ""unfriendly states"". both sides describe relations as at rock bottom and neither currently has an ambassador in-country; senior russian officials are under american sanctions for everything from annexing ukraine's crimea to alleged election meddling, and two former us marines are now in russian prisons one serving 16 years accused of espionage.  on top of all that, there's the moment in march when joe biden agreed with an interviewer that vladimir putin was ""a killer"". and yet, the two men are set to meet as presidents for the first time, and some in russia see that as an achievement in itself. ""the summit is important in terms of symbolism; it puts russia in the same league as the us, and for putin symbolism is not unimportant,"" says andrei kortunov, director of the riac think-tank in moscow. the meeting comes early in mr biden's time in the white house, on his first foreign trip and at his request all bonus points for the kremlin.  it's also a full summit not a brief encounter appended to some other event.  and despite a packed agenda, including meetings at nato headquarters in brussels on monday, there's particular interest in joe biden's final stop on his european trip, his one-on-one on wednesday with vladimir putin. ""putin definitely wants to be equal to the us president.  he wants to be respected on his terms,"" political analyst lilia shevtsova agrees.  ""putin wants to demonstrate macho muscle and to be a member of the club. ""the choice of geneva as a setting harks back to a cold war encounter in 1985: the first summit between ronald reagan and mikhail gorbachev.  but there's little prospect that this week's event will match that either for personal rapport or political thaw. today's white house says its aim is a ""stable"" and ""predictable"" relationship with russia.  but keeping people guessing and wary has been vladimir putin's way ever since his ""little green men"" entered crimea in 2014 and the peninsula was annexed from ukraine. it was the start of this slide in russia-us relations. ""a more feasible goal would be to test where each other's 'red lines' lie,"" ms shevtsova suggests, as well as ""an understanding that dialogue is the way back from the abyss"". 'if they're not talking, then russia will become more unpredictable,"" she argues. this weekend, vladimir putin told state tv there were ""issues where we can work together"" with the us, starting with new nuclear arms control talks, discussing regional conflicts including syria and libya, and climate change.  ""if we can create mechanisms for working on those issues, then i think we can say the summit was not in vain,"" mr putin argued.  some in russia suggest a truce in the ""diplomatic wars"" may also be possible: the us has expelled dozens of russian diplomats and shut down two compounds in recent years; now us missions in russia are to be barred from employing locals, meaning dramatic cuts in services including visas. moscow might allow its ambassador back to washington as a minimum move. the us will also raise the fate of its prisoners in russia, including paul whelan who was arrested in 2018 and convicted of espionage, which he has always denied.  russia recently renewed its push for a prisoner-swap but its terms have so far been impossible for the us to meet, and a unilateral gesture of generosity by mr putin seems unlikely.  russia's president has gone out of his way lately to underline his view of the west as hostile. at this month's economic forum in st petersburg, he claimed again that the us wants to ""contain"" russia's development.  a few days earlier, he had threatened to ""knock out the teeth"" of any foreign aggressor who wants to ""bite"" russia, insisting that the world needs to wake-up to the country's restored status and strength. ""clearly he believes the us is an adversary that doesn't wish russia well, and i don't think this vision will change,"" mr kortunov says. even so, he argues that russia may be looking to lower the temperature a notch or two. ""as a rational politician, putin would like to reduce the costs and risks associated with this adversarial relationship,"" mr kortunov believes.  that includes economic sanctions: the latest round restricted the government's capacity to raise funds and new steps could be further reaching, adding more strain to the economy in a key election year.  ""the russian public has no appetite for foreign policy 'victories' now as a substitute for addressing burning social and economic problems at home,"" mr kortunov says.  ""whatever putin might want, i don't think he can gain anything [domestically] by escalating. ""what vladimir putin doesn't want, but is braced for, is a lecture on human rights including the case of alexei navalny, russia's opposition politician first poisoned and now in prison. navalny's political offices and anti-corruption organisation have just been banned as ""extremist"" by a moscow court, a ruling that could easily have been delayed until after the summit.  instead, the timing seems meant to send a message: that vladimir putin will continue to crush dissent and that is none of america's business.   ""biden will do his song his prelude about navalny and human rights; then putin will do his song that the us is the same,"" ms shevtsova predicts, dryly.  ""but the fact this meeting is taking place means that after the human rights 'hors d'oeuvre', they'll move on to the main dish.  and that is: let's do something to lower the tension.

its official list of ""unfriendly states"".', ""both sides describe relations as at rock bottom and neither currently has an ambassador in-country; senior russian officials are under american sanctions for everything from annexing ukraine's crimea to alleged election meddling, and two former us marines are now in russian prisons one serving 16 years accused of espionage."", 'on top of all that, there\'s the moment in march when joe biden agreed with an interviewer that vladimir putin was ""a killer"".', 'and yet, the two men are set to meet as presidents for the first time, and some in russia see that as an achievement in itself.', '""the summit is important in terms of symbolism; it puts russia in the same league as the us, and for putin symbolism is not unimportant,"" says andrei kortunov, director of the riac think-tank in moscow.', ""the meeting comes early in mr biden's time in the white house, on his first foreign trip and at his request all bonus points for the kremlin."", ""it's also a full summit not a brief encounter appended to some other event."", ""and despite a packed agenda, including meetings at nato headquarters in brussels on monday, there's particular interest in joe biden's final stop on his european trip, his one-on-one on wednesday with vladimir putin."", '""putin definitely wants to be equal to the us president.', 'he wants to be respected on his terms,"" political analyst lilia shevtsova agrees.', '""putin wants to demonstrate macho muscle and to be a member of the club.', '""the choice of geneva as a setting harks back to a cold war encounter in 1985: the first summit between ronald reagan and mikhail gorbachev.', ""but there's little prospect that this week's event will match that either for personal rapport or political thaw."", 'today\'s white house says its aim is a ""stable"" and ""predictable"" relationship with russia.', 'but keeping people guessing and wary has been vladimir putin\'s way ever since his ""little green men"" entered crimea in 2014 and the peninsula was annexed from ukraine.', 'it was the start of this slide in russia-us relations.', '""a more feasible goal would be to test where each other\'s \'red lines\' lie,"" ms shevtsova suggests, as well as ""an understanding that dialogue is the way back from the abyss"".', '\'if they\'re not talking, then russia will become more unpredictable,"" she argues.', 'this weekend, vladimir putin told state tv there were ""issues where we can work together"" with the us, starting with new nuclear arms control talks, discussing regional conflicts including syria and libya, and climate change.', '""if we can create mechanisms for working on those issues, then i think we can say the summit was not in vain,"" mr putin argued.', 'some in russia suggest a truce in the ""diplomatic wars"" may also be possible: the us has expelled dozens of russian diplomats and shut down two compounds in recent years; now us missions in russia are to be barred from employing locals, meaning dramatic cuts in services including visas.', 'moscow might allow its ambassador back to washington as a minimum move.', 'the us will also raise the fate of its prisoners in russia, including paul whelan who was arrested in 2018 and convicted of espionage, which he has always denied.', 'russia recently renewed its push for a prisoner-swap but its terms have so far been impossible for the us to meet, and a unilateral gesture of generosity by mr putin seems unlikely.', ""russia's president has gone out of his way lately to underline his view of the west as hostile."", 'at this month\'s economic forum in st petersburg, he claimed again that the us wants to ""contain"" russia\'s development.', 'a few days earlier, he had threatened to ""knock out the teeth"" of any foreign aggressor who wants to ""bite"" russia, insisting that the world needs to wake-up to the country\'s restored status and strength.', '""clearly he believes the us is an adversary that doesn\'t wish russia well, and i don\'t think this vision will change,"" mr kortunov says.', 'even so, he argues that russia may be looking to lower the temperature a notch or two.', '""as a rational politician, putin would like to reduce the costs and risks associated with this adversarial relationship,"" mr kortunov believes.', ""that includes economic sanctions: the latest round restricted the government's capacity to raise funds and new steps could be further reaching, adding more strain to the economy in a key election year."", '""the russian public has no appetite for foreign policy \'victories\' now as a substitute for addressing burning social and economic problems at home,"" mr kortunov says.', '""whatever putin might want, i don\'t think he can gain anything [domestically] by escalating.', '""what vladimir putin doesn\'t want, but is braced for, is a lecture on human rights including the case of alexei navalny, russia\'s opposition politician first poisoned and now in prison.', 'navalny\'s political offices and anti-corruption organisation have just been banned as ""extremist"" by a moscow court, a ruling that could easily have been delayed until after the summit.', ""instead, the timing seems meant to send a message: that vladimir putin will continue to crush dissent and that is none of america's business."", '""biden will do his song his prelude about navalny and human rights; then putin will do his song that the us is the same,"" ms shevtsova predicts, dryly.', '""but the fact this meeting is taking place means that after the human rights \'hors d\'oeuvre\', they\'ll move on to the main dish.', ""and that is: let's do something to lower the tension."", '""awkward conversation looms for biden and putinputin: biden

""the hotel has worked with vendors to launch activities targeted at families, he added.  these include dim sum cooking classes and virtual reality game experiences. sneakpeek singapore, which organises walking, hiking and kayaking tours, said it is preparing for larger groups, such as readying more kayaks. it added: ""operationally, it will be much easier, less taxing, and less logistically complex to operate tours with sub-groups of five people instead of two. ""during phase two (heightened alert), there was little confidence to make bookings, even for after june 13, but now people are. . .  booking tours for dates that are further away. ""other organisations such as wildlife reserves singapore and dream cruises have said they will increase their maximum capacity in line with what is allowed. the loosened restrictions will also benefit the likes of kitten sanctuary singapore, a non-profit animal welfare group for cats.  executive director jessica seet said the group will now be able to accept more visitors and allow more volunteers to help out. ""visitors are our lifeline to cover (the various) costs for rescued cats and kittens. . .  so the easing of restrictions helps us to stay afloat,"" said ms seet. the islamic religious council of singapore said on saturday that four mosques will pilot the use of an extra zone in order to offer more spaces for friday prayers on june 25. in a facebook post yesterday evening, prime minister lee hsien loong thanked the public for observing the tightened measures this past month. ""if all goes well, we should be able to open up further by next week,"" he said.  ""in the new normal, such disruptions will happen from time to time, but we can still carry on with our lives.

""this will support f&b businesses as we gradually move back to phase three (heightened alert), and encourage them to continue with food delivery sales in the longer run,"" said esg in a statement yesterday. the food delivery booster package, which subsidises part of f&b businesses' food delivery costs, will be extended to july 15. the package, which started on may 16, was initially meant to run till tomorrow by helping f&b businesses affected by tightened restrictions under phase two. along with the extension, seven more food delivery platforms and third-party logistics players have been added to the pool of service providers which f&b businesses can work with, bringing the total to 13.  the new additions are food delivery platform bungkus, and third-party logistics companies chope, grabexpress, pandago, dlvrd, milkrun and yy circle. the initial pool of six are food delivery platforms deliveroo, foodpanda and grabfood, and third-party logistics companies lalamove, zeek logistics and pickupp. under the extension, esg will continue to provide funding for 5 percentage points of the commission cost charged by food delivery platforms, as well as 20 per cent of delivery costs for those who use third-party logistics partners. from today, some covid-19 restrictions will also be loosened, with social gatherings of up to five persons allowed.  however, dining in at eateries will be allowed only from next monday, provided that the pandemic situation remains under control. noting that dine-in restrictions in the past few weeks have been challenging for the f&b sector, minister of state for trade and industry low yen ling said the extension of the booster package ""seeks to alleviate the painful effects of disruption and offer a longer runway of support, even after dine-in services resume on june 21"". since being re-introduced last month, the booster package has benefited more than 10,000 f&b establishments, said ms low. however, she also highlighted that ""food delivery is becoming part and parcel of the new normal"". preliminary estimates by esg show that the daily average number of online food deliveries supported by the booster package was close to 20 per cent higher under phase two (heightened alert) than during the circuit breaker last year. according to esg, the percentage of sales from online food delivery increased from an average of 12. 5 per cent from january to march last year, to 22. 5 per cent in the same period this year. with the uncertainty of the pandemic, esg said the booster package is also meant to encourage businesses to continue with food delivery sales as part of their long-term strategy, so that they can be more resilient amid future business disruptions. asian gastropub slake managed to diversify its revenue streams after using an esg grant to develop an online storefront, which enabled it to tap esg's booster package. after a marketing campaign boosted its sales and social media presence, slake is now looking into converting its siglap kitchen into a cloud kitchen and setting up a second one later this year. ms low said: ""consumers are increasingly savvy in searching online for the best food and deals to be sent to their doorsteps. ""we hope the extended food delivery booster package will place our f&b establishments on a firm footing for a resilient recovery as they gain new skills and platforms critical for long-term growth.

2021-06-14,Euro 2020: Netherlands 3-2 Ukraine full match reaction & quotes: Defiant De Boer vows second-half struggles 'will not happen again'.,"netherlands manager frank de boer has vowed that his side will not concede another big lead under his watch, after denzel dumfries' maiden goal for his country rescued victory against ukraine in their euro 2020 opener. the psv eindhoven man bagged an 85th minute winner after finishes for andriy yarmolenko and roman yaremchuk had cancelled out georginio wijnaldum and wout weghorst's earlier efforts. de boer's blushes were excused by the late intervention, but coming only weeks after a similar spate of concessions against scotland, the 51-year-old has now sought to assure supporters that it will not become a recurring trait of his side's performances. ""i saw a dutch team that played very balanced and dominant,"" the former ajax and atlanta united boss told his post-match press conference.  ""we can be proud. ""we analyze such games almost to the death.  we want to do everything we can to ensure that something like this [comeback] doesn't happen again. ""playing in front of a vocal home crowd at johan cruyff arena, the netherlands often seemed buoyed by the strength of their support, even at limited capacity, with several players quick to highlight the impact. wolfsburg striker weghorst, who snagged the oranje's second, was one who delighted in the response, stating: ""it was a great thing. ""i'm glad there were 16,000 people in the stadium today.  i've seen a lot of orange.  i am happy that we could celebrate the three points together with the fans.  that was great. ""matchwinner dumfries agreed, adding:  ""it's great to hear the fans in the stadium again. ""the dutch's struggles- which echoed their aforementioned 2-2 friendly draw with scotland earlier this month continues to mark out the fragile nature of de boer's tactical formations, having eschewed the 4-3-3 his players have professed to be more comfortable with before for a 3-5-2. nevertheless, there was little criticism post-match, with dumfries adding on the madcap finale: ""it was a great moment, a great relief.  we believed in ourselves.  i knew we would still get chances. ""weghorst's contribution to the game was also hailed by his team-mates, with defender stefan de vrij quick to praise his ethic throughout.

""the netherlands now turn to their next group c clash, welcoming fellow matchwinners austria to amsterdam on june 17, knowing that victory will likely ensure their progression to the knockout stages. they will be wary of a time who ultimately ran out comfortable victors over north macedonia in the end, but will likely take confidence from their high-energy showing on home turf as they look to end their seven-year tournament exodus with an impressive comeback run.

2021-06-14,G7’s Carbis Bay declaration: the key pledges.,"world leaders issue joint statement promising action on vaccines, china and global corporate taxlast modified on sun 13 jun 2021 18. 54 edtas the g7 finishes in cornwall, here are some of the issues they pledged to act on in their carbis bay declaration. the g7 pledged over the next 12 months to secure a further 1bn vaccine doses either through donating surplus supplies or providing further finance to covax, the un-backed scheme charged with distributing vaccines to low- and middle-income countries. the main new pledges came from the us, uk and germany.  the communique also set out plans to reduce roadblocks to production in africa and on the controversial issue of enforced temporary waivers of patents said they will support manufacturing in low income countries.  they said they would engage constructively on the issue of intellectual property waivers in discussions at the world trade organization. the united kingdom's 100m-dose pledge is ""entirely new"", according to a spokesperson.  the united states has already donated $2bn (£1. 4bn) to covax, according to a white house official.  in february, the biden administration pledged $2bn more.  but that second $2bn will now fund the purchase of the pfizer doses, manufactured in the us, along with $1. 5bn in additional funds, according to the official. the communique did not set out a detailed country-by-country commitment or a timetable to act.  many of the commitments were not new.  but the eu's 100m-dose commitment was promised during a summit in may, and the us commitment partially replaces earlier promises to fund covax directly.  the issue of intellectual property waivers was fudged. the g7 called on china to ""respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, especially in relation to xinjiang and those rights, freedoms and high degree of autonomy for hong kong enshrined in the sino-british joint declaration and the basic law"".  the g7 underscored ""the importance of peace and stability across the taiwan strait, and encourage the peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues"". they also called for a ""timely, transparent, expert-led and science-based"" investigation into the causes of covid, convened by the world health organization and including china.  the g7 also vowed to cooperate with china on issues such as the climate. in a separate statement the white house said: ""the us and our g7 partners remain deeply concerned by the use of all forms of forced labor in global supply chains, including state-sponsored forced labor of vulnerable groups and minorities and supply chains of the agricultural, solar, and garment sectors – the main supply chains of concern in xinjiang. ""the sections on china, a change on what the grouping would have said a few years back, do not contain any commitments beyond cooperation to remove forced labour from supply chains. as well as discussing measures to tackle covid, g7 leaders said they would ""act now to strengthen the global health and health security system to be better prepared for future pandemics"". they pledged to reinforce global surveillance for potentially dangerous diseases.  as well as the joint call for an investigation into the causes of covid, joe biden suggested at his press conference it was time to look again at the theory that it may have originated in a lab. at his press conference, boris johnson suggested the new health surveillance system could involve creating a new global watchdog with powers to carry out inspections to monitor outbreaks, along the lines of existing systems for controlling chemical weapons. the leaders agreed that in the event of a future outbreak, g7 nations would act rapidly, with the aim of making vaccines, tests and treatments available within 100 days. the plans were based on recommendations from the uk's chief scientific adviser, patrick vallance, and melinda french gates, who are part of a pandemic preparedness partnership advising the g7 nations. as well as speeding up the creation of drugs and treatments, the agreement is aimed at preventing the beggar-my-neighbour policies during the early days of the pandemic, when governments were competing to procure personal protective equipment, driving up prices.  the leaders committed to a ""one health"" approach in future. there was progress towards a global deal that will put a 15% floor under the tax paid by the world's largest corporations, and in particular tech firms such as amazon, google and facebook.  biden wanted a 21% minimum tax rate, but was persuaded that when countries such as ireland and cyprus would need to bring up their tax rates from 12. 5%, a 15% rate was more likely to gain widespread agreement.  critics said the g7 had let multinationals off the hook with a rate that failed to prevent tax havens thriving, and could force high-tax countries into a race down to the 15% level. leaders of the richest seven nations agreed to repudiate the policies of austerity and retrenchment that were implemented in the years after the 2008 banking crash and, in the words of johnson, build back better and in a way that makes society more equal and protects the environment.  there was strong recognition that economies would benefit from stimulus programmes that were larger and longer lasting than seen in a decade.  only the prime minister of italy, mario draghi, a former central bank governor, cautioned that to calm financial markets leaders should signal that they would one day seek to reduce currently high levels of borrowing. the g7 also agreed to increase the special drawing rights (sdrs) of low-income countries by $100bn.  sdrs are issued by the international monetary fund (imf) to boost the reserves and reduce the borrowing costs of vulnerable countries, allowing them to increase spending on health systems and cover pandemic costs.  the south african president, cyril ramaphosa, said this fell short of the $162bn he had asked the g7 to agree while anti-poverty groups said the g7 had failed to spell out the terms of the sdrs.

2021-06-14,Victoria on track for further easing of Covid restrictions after recording one new case.,"the new local case is a primary close contact of another coronavirus case and has been self-isolating first published on sat 12 jun 2021 18. 42 edtmelbourne is on track for a further easing of restrictions later in the week after recording one new locally acquired covid case on sunday. the health department on sunday confirmed the new case is a close contact of an already infected person and has been quarantining throughout their infectious period. the case is a close contact of a case linked to the arcare mainstone aged care outbreak, however they are not a resident. some 17,102 victorians were tested in the 24 hours to sunday morning, while 14,390 received a covid-19 vaccine dose at state-run hubs. on sunday morning, acting premier james merlino said ""it is a good thing"" that the new case was ""already in quarantine"", but stressed ""we are not over this (outbreak) yet"". merlino was also pressed about a further easing of covid restrictions, but provided no specific details claiming he didn't want to give ""a false indication"" ahead of public health advice. ""i've got no announcements today.  i know that people are very keen on the answer, and we want to get crowds back to, whether it is afl or netball basketball or whatever sport, and theatre production, we want to get crowds and attendances back to these events and back to where we were just a few short weeks ago,"" he said. ""my expectation is by later in the week, we will be in a position to announce further easing of restrictions for regional victoria and further easing for metropolitan melbourne,"" merlino said. at a press conference later on sunday, victoria's health minister, martin foley, said australia was ""nowhere near"" ready to discuss reopening its international border. ""other countries are already having that conversation but those countries are at 50, 60, 70% vaccination rates.  we are just over three per cent fully-vaccinated,"" he said. ""what we need to do is have our focus on firstly keeping the virus at bay through dedicated risk-based quarantine facilities and keeping on top of outbreaks. ""overnight, scott morrison reaffirmed australia's suppression strategy to contain covid-19. speaking on the sidelines of the g7 summit in the united kingdom, where he is an observer, morrison faced questions about when australians would be able to travel like he had done. ""in australia, we've been in a position where we have been able to suppress the virus and keep it out.  that sadly hasn't been able to be achieved here and across europe and the united states and so their experience has been very very different,"" the prime minister said. ""we'll continue to take an australian path on this which protects the lives and livelihoods and learn from the experiences of other countries,"" morrison said. sunday's new case in victoria comes as authorities work to link saturday's local virus case to the kappa strain outbreak.  saturday's case, a man living in central melbourne with his young family, is a ""mystery case"" until a connection is found. testing commander jeroen weimar said he was confident this link would be found but said he was more concerned about undiscovered cases because of low testing rates. ""there may well be more out there,"" he told reporters on saturday. he asked victorians to make each other accountable for possible coronavirus symptoms and to encourage each other to get tested. ""call them out in the nicest possible way,"" he said. there were just over 15,000 tests on friday and similar numbers the day before.  this is compared to 30,000 to 40,000 daily tests earlier in the outbreak. there are now 74 active cases in the state, including returned travellers in hotel quarantine. merlino also welcomed the news that premier daniel andrews will return to work on 28 june as he recovers from fracturing his spine and ribs. if you can, you must. let's beat this, victoria.  pic. twitter. com/gvzkce5jpsandrews, who tweeted a picture of himself getting vaccinated on sunday, said he had been given the all-clear by doctors to return to work. ""i will happily hand him back the keys, but it is great news,"" merlino said.  ""i am sure i speak for all victorians in that we are really pleased, everyone, every victorian who has had a severe back injury knows how long and painful the recovery is. ""following a two-week lockdown that ended on friday, melburnians are allowed to travel up to 25km from home and meet outside in groups of up to 10.  masks are required indoors and outdoors and hospitality, retail and schools have reopened. there are more than 3,000 primary close contacts in quarantine as a result of community cases, as well as 122 exposure sites. additional reporting by australian associated press.

""thank you benjamin netanyahu for your lengthy and achievement-filled service on behalf of the state of israel,"" mr bennett said in a speech at the start of the session. the government, including for the first time a party that represents israel's 21 per cent arab minority, plans largely to avoid sweeping moves on hot-button international issues such as policy towards the palestinians, and to focus on domestic reforms. with little to no prospect of progress towards resolving the decades-long conflict with israel, many palestinians will be unmoved by the change of administration, saying mr bennett will likely pursue the same right-wing agenda as mr netanyahu. that looked likely regarding israel's top security concern, iran.  a bennett spokesman said he would vow ""vigorous opposition"" should the united states return to the 2015 iranian nuclear deal but would seek cooperation with the administration of us president joe biden.

2021-06-14,Christchurch attacks: producer resigns from film They Are Us as criticism grows.,"jacinda ardern says subject still feels 'very raw' amid ongoing accusations that film sidelines muslim victims of 2019 massacrelast modified on sun 13 jun 2021 23. 28 edta producer for a controversial hollywood film depicting jacinda ardern's response to the christchurch terror attacks has resigned from the project after criticisms that it sidelined muslim victims. the premise of the film, they are us, has also been criticised by its proposed subject, new zealand prime minister ardern, who is slated to be played by rose byrne.  ardern said on sunday it felt ""very soon and very raw"" for new zealand, and that she was not an appropriate focus for a film about the 2019 mosque attacks.  ""there are plenty of stories from march 15 that could be told, but i don't consider mine to be one of them,"" she said.  ardern has reiterated that she has no involvement with the film. the movie was announced by the hollywood reporter on friday, and billed as an ""inspirational story about the young leader's response to the tragic events"". it immediately came under fire for centring on the leadership of a white woman against the backdrop of the mass murder of 51 muslims by a white supremacist.  many muslim new zealanders criticised the move as ""exploitative"", ""insensitive"", and ""obscene"".  a petition to shut down the film's production has gained about 60,000 signatures over the past three days. on monday, new zealand producer philippa campbell announced that she was resigning from the proposed production.  ""i've listened to the concerns raised over recent days and i have heard the strength of people's views.  i now agree that the events of march 15, 2019 are too raw for film at this time and do not wish to be involved with a project that is causing such distress,"" she said in a statement released to media. ""the announcement was focused on film business, and did not take enough account of the political and human context of the story in this country.  it's the complexity of that context i've been reflecting on that has led me to this decision. ""when the film was announced on friday, writer and community advocate guled mire told the guardian that the premise was ""completely insensitive"". ""the reality is many victims are struggling right now.  they're really still trying to pick up the pieces – financially, everything,"" he said.

2021-06-14,Djokovic v Tsitsipas live stream and match preview.,"novak djokovic and stefanos tsitsipas will square off in the final of the 2021 french open today at 14. 00pm (uk time). novak djokovic produced his best ever performance at roland garros in his semifinal match against rafael nadal.  he recovered from an awful start (0-5 in the first set) to deliver one of most memorable wins of his career against the spaniard.  it was nole's second victory over rafael nadal on parisian clay and he is now bidding to become the first male in the open era to have won all slams at least twice.  nole has won 14 of his last 15 matches on clay and has dropped just five sets in his most recent ten outings. meanwhile, stefanos tsistsipas has had an excellent start against alexander zverev by taking the first two sets, but then he wasted it and allowed the german to level the score.  however, stefanos managed to regain his focus and clinched the match in the final set to become the first greek to reach the final of a grand slam.  tsitsipas fully deserves his place in the final as he has been one of the best performers on clay over the past two months. after nole's display in the semifinals, he should be able to lift the trophy here, but we want fancy over 3. 5 sets at the price of 67/100 with bet365.

2021-06-14,Football: Moore grabs point for Wales in Euro 2020 opener with Switzerland.,"baku: a header from towering kieffer moore claimed a point for wales in a 1-1 draw with switzerland in baku on saturday (jun 12) to start both teams' euro 2020 campaigns. moore responded to breel embolo's second-half opener with a quarter of an hour remaining.  both sides trail group a leaders italy, who beat turkey 3-0 in friday's tournament curtain-raiser. wales coach robert page named gareth bale on the left wing as the real madrid attacker was one of three wales survivors in the starting line-up from the 2016 semi-final loss to portugal. switzerland boss vladimir petkovic kept benfica's haris seferovic and borussia moenchengladbach's breel embolo up front despite mario gavranovic scoring four times in two pre-tournament friendlies. with petkovic naming a narrow back three, bale and fellow winger dan james found space out wide early on in front of an estimated 10,000 crowd as local authorities allowed up to 50-percent capacity in the 69,000-seater olympic stadium. after a quarter of an hour played, james broke free down the left before finding 1. 95 metre-tall moore who forced swiss goalkeeper yann sommer to tip the ball over the bar. from the resulting corner, moore rose highest again and clashed in the air with manuel akanji, which left the cardiff forward playing the remainder of the game with red tape around his head. with moore bandaged, the momentum swung towards petkovic's side and they dominated the remainder of the half but seferovic wasted three chances. moore returned after the interval despite completing just one of his team's 101 passes in the first half. petkovic's switzerland, who reached the last 16 five years ago, remained in control with captain granit xhaka, liverpool's xherdan shaqiri and atalanta's remo freuler dominating midfield. embolo sparks to lifethey broke the deadlock four minutes into the second half as embolo sparked into life after a quiet opening 45 minutes. he broke down the middle and forced danny ward into a save, which gave shaqiri a corner on the right flank. he delivered to embolo who headed home after beating wales right-back connor roberts with ease for just his sixth goal in 44 international appearances. shaqiri, who played just 14 premier league games for liverpool last season, was substituted on 66 minutes for the more defensive denis zakaria. despite petkovic's pragmatic change in personnel, wales equalised with 16 minutes remaining. manchester united's james played a corner short which ended up at joe morrell's feet and he crossed into the box. moore lost his marker and headed a well-placed effort passed the out-stretched sommer to send the roughly 300 travelling wales fans into a frenzy behind the opposite goal. james was then replaced by david brooks as both sides searched for a winner. seferovic was substituted for 31-year-old gavranovic on 84 minutes and the dinamo zagreb forward thought he had claimed all three points for his side with his first touch. after edging past the wales backline he beat ward but his effort was chalked off for offside by var. switzerland pressed on in five minutes of injury time and gavranovic was denied another potential winner, this time ward saving with his finger tips. ramsey left the field for ethan ampadu during time added on and page's men held on for a point. wales stay in baku for their next game when they face turkey on wednesday, with switzerland taking on italy in rome later that day. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-14,Lee Kwang Soo Shares His Gratitude And Love For The Members And Fans In Final “Running Man” Appearance.,"on june 13, sbs's ""running man"" aired their final race with lee kwang soo. back in april, lee kwang soo announced that he was stepping down from the show after eleven years due to persisting issues with the ankle injury he sustained last year. in the june 13 episode, lee kwang soo met with the production staff ahead of time to create a race full of memories to share with the other members.  he said, ""first, i want to go to the place where we first started filming.  we also went to the han river a lot on the show, and the weather is nice these days.  of the things i want to eat, i have fond memories of the chicken and kalguksu i had when we filmed at my house.  if possible, i also want to eat grilled pork belly.  it would also be nice to go to the lp bar again. ""he added, ""personally, i want it to feel like normal.  that's my honest feeling. ""just as lee kwang soo wished, the race opened at the same location where ""running man"" had started filming eleven years ago.  ji suk jin said, ""even the staff members are sad for kwang soo's final recording.  let's talk about him a lot today. "" but lee kwang soo quipped, ""you didn't say anything while we weren't recording, but as soon as the cameras turned on, you came out with that line ready. ""hilariously, the production staff sentenced lee kwang soo to 1050 years in prison after reviewing all the actions he had committed during the past eleven years of filming ""running man. "" the ""race"" this episode was about the other members helping him to commute and reduce his sentence. after lee kwang soo had changed into his prison clothes and the cast were on their way to their next mission, yoo jae suk said jokingly, ""you should rethink your decision.  if you suddenly said right now, 'i'm sorry!', then the viewers would understand.  they'd be like, 'that rascal,' and laugh, and move on. "" haha asked lee kwang soo what he would do on mondays now that he wouldn't film ""running man,"" and yoo jae suk said, ""he'll just lie there. ""one of the missions featured the other cast members answering questions about lee kwang soo, which ji suk jin, haha, and jun so min failed.  however, yoo jae suk moved lee kwang soo by getting the name of lee kwang soo's father correct.  song ji hyo and kim jong kook also got their answers correct and the sentence was reduced by 120 years.  in the final mission, lee kwang soo succeeded on his first try and reduced his sentence to zero. at the end, the cast members and lee kwang soo wrote letters to each other.  ji suk jin wrote, ""it's been eleven years since i first met you.  at first, i only knew you from tv as that tall kid, but now you're a younger brother whom i'll always be with.  even though it wasn't much when we first started it, it somehow became a meaningful moment for me.  i was happy every time we did the 'pil! chok! cross!' together.  let's go together always, even if it isn't on 'running man. '""yoo jae suk said, ""it's been eleven years since we started 'running man' together.  you've been through a lot and worked hard during that time.  i'm not sure who i'll keep interrupting and piggybacking now, but i think it will probably be yang se chan or ji suk jin.  it will feel empty without you, but you should do all the things that you wanted to do now without worrying about us.  let's see each other often, and call me when something happens.  thank you, kwang soo.  thanks to you, it was never dull. ""kim jong kook said, ""i'm not sure what was so funny now, thinking about all the times we started laughing while just looking at each other.  it felt like we would go on like this forever without changing.  the regret is even stronger because it's kwang soo, with whom i thought i would go until the end.  even though we aren't able to go on with 'running man' together anymore, let's go for the rest of our lives together.  stay healthy. ""haha said, ""since i've seen you every week for 11 years, it feels like i'll see you again next week still.  i think that the viewers are so sad about this because they could see that lee kwang soo had always done his best and showed his passion until now.  kwang soo, you worked hard.  who will i tease now? who will i con now? who will i talk all night with now? i'll pray for you to shine wherever you are and achieve all the dreams you want. ""although the atmosphere was a tearful one, song ji hyo's letter prompted laughter when lee kwang soo was unable to decipher her handwriting.  she had written, ""when i was annoyed, happy, having a hard time, weighed down, moved, when i was in a strange place or saw something strange.  thanks for spending all these moments of the past 11 years with me.  you worked hard. "" at the end of the recording, she wrote a longer letter that said, ""i said this earlier, but i still can't believe that you, who has always been there, won't be there anymore.  i feel like it will all collapse once i realize it, but visit us whenever you're sad.  i love you. ""jun so min said, ""i'm grateful that we've known each other for this time that feels long at times and short at others.  thank you for gifting me with memories that i will never forget.  i'll pray for each step you take in future.  we'll keep things going strong! also, please visit whenever.  we'll be waiting for you. "" yang se chan said, ""you worked hard for the past 11 years.  i was really happy spending the past four years with you.  we always call each other after the end of every recording and talked about a lot of things, but now we can't do that.  i'll miss you, and it will feel empty without you.  do everything you want in a world without punishments. ""in his final letter, lee kwang soo said, ""the members helped me get to where i am today.  they feel like another family, and i am so, so grateful to them.  i'm sorry.  i'm sorry again.  i wasn't always great in the past eleven years, but i always did my best.  'running man' is a show where everyone without exception does their best and throws their whole bodies into filming.  i ask that people continue to show it more love and interest in future.  thank you.

2021-06-14,"Doc on Eriksen, who had cardiac arrest: He was gone, we got him back , Latest Football News.","the scoreboard at copenhagen's parken stadium read denmark 0 finland 1 yesterday morning (singapore time). but the more important result was delivered at the nearby rigshospitalet medical facility danish playmaker christian eriksen was awake, stable and responsive after suffering cardiac arrest during the euro 2020 group b opener.  tests so far have returned normal results. many feared the worst after the 29-year-old inter milan midfielder had collapsed on the field while he was about to receive a throw-in in the 42nd minute, with no one challenging him. cardiologists hailed the quick response from various parties as being crucial to the successful resuscitation of eriksen. referee anthony taylor promptly stopped play and called for medical attention. denmark captain simon kjaer, the first to attend to eriksen, checked to make sure that his teammate's airway was clear, before administering the first dose of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr). dr scott murray, a cardiologist with the uk's national health service, told mailonline that kjaer did the right thing. ""we're just lucky that the players on the pitch knew what to do, to put him in a safe position and make sure he wasn't choking and alert the medical team,"" said dr murray. denmark's players and staff some of whom were in tears quickly formed a protective human wall around their stricken teammate as he received medical attention from the physios and paramedics. eriksen was then revived with a defibrillator and taken to hospital. team doctor morten boesen said yesterday: ""he was gone; we did cardiac resuscitation, it was a cardiac arrest.  we got him back after one defib (defibrillation). ""the match resumed one hour and 45 minutes later, after news came through that eriksen had regained consciousness. denmark coach kasper hjulmand said several of his players had been too overwhelmed by the incident to finish the match. ""i completely understand that you can't play a soccer match at this level after watching one of your best friends fight for his life,"" a visibly drained hjulmand said at the news conference. players were given the option of finishing the game a day later, said the 49-year-old, adding there was no pressure from uefa to complete it on the same day. ""it was more manageable to go in again and honestly just get it over with,"" said hjulmand.  his side lost 1-0 to a joel pohjanpalo header. the danes used video conferencing to communicate with eriksen, who told hjulman he did not remember much from the collapse and that he was keen to get back on to the pitch. professor sanjay sharma, who is chairman of the expert cardiology consensus panel for england's football association, told the bbc ""the thing that saved eriksen's life was very urgent and rapid medical attention"". dr sharma, who was eriksen's former cardiologist, also told the mail on sunday that the player had no history of heart concerns while he was with english premier league club tottenham hotspur from 2013 to 2019. ""i thought, 'oh my god? is there something there that we didn't see?' but i have looked at all the test results and everything looked perfect,"" said dr sharma. ""from the day we signed him, it was my job to screen him and we tested him every year.  so certainly his tests up to 2019 were completely normal, with no obvious underlying cardiac fault.  i can vouch for that because i did the tests. ""former bolton wanderers midfielder fabrice muamba said that eriksen's collapse evoked memories of his cardiac arrest on the pitch in an fa cup match in 2012. ""to watch it from that distance and not know what was going to happen, it was scary, but credit to the medical staff,"" muamba, who had to retire soon after his cardiac arrest at the age of 24, told the bbc. ""they have done an amazing job on christian.  i like how his teammates got together to protect him. ""eriksen's former spurs teammates jan vertonghen, toby alderweireld and nacer chadli were distraught when they heard the news ahead of their 3-0 group b win over russia. his inter teammate romelu lukaku, who bagged a brace, dedicated his goals to him. while the cause of eriksen's cardiac arrest is uncertain, the quick intervention definitely made a key difference, with cardiologists emphasising the importance of recognising the signs and having life-saving cpr skills. dr yeo tee joo, consultant cardiologist and director of cardiac rehabilitation at singapore's national university heart centre, tweeted: ""praying for #christianeriksen's full recovery.  early recognition + prompt cpr + defibrillation saves lives regardless of aetiology of cardiac arrest. ""extremely important knowledge and skill that all should have. ""uk-based cardiologist dr sam mohiddin told the bbc: ""the moment of extreme peril is the time of the cardiac arrest and treating that is a matter that requires people to promptly recognise what is happening and really address it quickly with cpr and a defibrillator. ""cpr saves lives.  most of us should learn how to perform cpr for all sorts of reasons and not just because cardiac arrests can affect sportspeople.

""i am relieved,"" wijnaldum said.  ""overall, we played a good game, but we gave them two chances in 10 minutes which were two goals.  we need to learn that if we play such a match we need to finish it off well.  we let them get back into the game and that needs to improve.

2021-06-14,Tennis: Djokovic beats Tsitsipas to win French Open title.,"paris: novak djokovic captured his second french open title as he recovered from being outplayed for two sets by stefanos tsitsipas to win 6-7(6) 2-6 6-3 6-2 6-4 victory on sunday (jun 13). djokovic's seismic semi-final win over 13-times champion rafa nadal looked like being in vain as an inspired tsitsipas moved to the brink of becoming greece's first grand slam champion. after failing to convert a set point in an enthralling 72-minute opener full of brutal rallies and then crumbling in surprising fashion in the second set, djokovic looked drained. his hopes of banking a 19th grand slam title were hanging by a thread but he rediscovered his mojo in the nick of time to turn the match around in emphatic fashion. the 34-year-old, who won his first french crown in 2016, rattled through the third and fourth sets as tsitsipas, playing in his first grand slam final, struggled to maintain the intensity that had put him in charge. fifth seed tsitsipas appeared to be struggling physically but valiantly tried to dig in at the start of the fifth set as the shadows spread across a sunlit court philippe chatrier. but djokovic got the early break in the decider and although he was pushed hard, he was never threatened again. there were nerves as he served at 5-4, netting an easy volley and then seeing a tsitsipas backhand flash past him on championship point.  but djokovic would not be denied as he claimed victory by angling away another volley at the second time of asking after four hours 11 minutes. in moving just one behind the record of 20 shared by nadal and roger federer, djokovic became the first player in the professional era to win each grand slam title at least twice. ""it was again an electric atmosphere.  nine hours of tennis in less than 48 hours,"" djokovic said on court. ""it's not easy; physically and mentally it was very, very difficult for me, these three days.  i believed in my capacities and in my game.  it's a dream come true. ""djokovic earned his 19th grand slam title the hard way. not only did he inflict only a third ever defeat on nadal, he also became the first player in the professional era to win a grand slam title having twice come back from a two sets down, having also found himself staring at defeat against lorenzo musetti in the fourth round. there was no easing in to his first grand slam final for tsitsipas who had to save two break points in his opening service game, one with a backhand and one with an ace. rock solidtsistipas settled quickly, however, marking out his territory with his backhand looking rock solid. favourite djokovic was thrown off his stride when he took a heavy tumble chasing down a drop shot at 3-3 and the serb found himself in trouble at 4-5, framing a forehand high into the stands to hand tsistipas a set point. the players traded backhands but djokovic produced a clever angle to save fend off the set point. he then served for the set at 6-5 but produced a poor game and a tiebreak was needed to separate them. it was djokovic who looked to be feeling the strain as he double-faulted on the way to falling 4-0 behind. but he regrouped and produced a sensational drop volley at 3-5 before forging 6-5 ahead only to see his set point whipped away by a fizzing tsitsipas forehand. djokovic then shunted a backhand wide to hand tsitsipas a second set point and this time the greek took advantage as djokovic's forehand misfired. there was a hint of despondency in djokovic's body language and tsitsipas sensed it, seizing control of the match to dominate the second set after breaking early. djokovic netted a forehand to fall 2-5 down and offered scant resistance as tsitsipas held to take a two-set. just as against musetti in the fourth round, the backlash was instant. djokovic began striking the ball more aggressively and closer to the lines and he engineered five break points in an energy-sapping fourth game eventually converting for a 3-1 lead when the greek missed a backhand down the line. after winning the third set djokovic carried the momentum into the fourth and tsitsipas, who had some treatment on his lower back, appeared to be crumbling as he dropped serve twice. the crowd tries to spur tsitsipas on in the fifth but there was no escape as djokovic rolled to victory. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-14,Airline industry sees long-term rebound for sector amid COVID-19.,"paris: after flying into the financial turbulence of the covid-19 pandemic, the airline sector expects passenger traffic to take off despite concerns about the industry's impact on climate change. in its latest look at trends for the sector, the international air transport association (iata) said it doesn't expect world air traffic to resume to its pre-pandemic level before 2023. but over 20 years, air traffic should almost double, from 4. 5 billion passengers in 2019 to 8. 5 billion in 2039. that is, however, a drop of one billion passengers from iata's pre-crisis forecast. nevertheless that will be good news for aircraft manufacturers, who slowed down production during the crisis as airlines cancelled orders to stay financially afloat. airbus has already announced it plans to step up the manufacturing cadence of its best-selling a320 single-aisle aircraft and should reach a record level already in 2023. boeing, for its part, forecasts that airlines will need 43,110 new aircraft through 2039, which will result in a near doubling of the global fleet.  asia alone will account for 40 per cent of that demand. as with the sep11 attacks or the global financial crisis of 2007-2009, ""the industry will prove resilient again"", darren hulst, vice president of marketing at boeing, said last year. marc ivaldi, research director at the paris-based school for advanced studies in the social sciences, noted that only 1 per cent of the population currently uses air travel. ""with the simple demographic rise and the fact that people become richer there will be rising demand for air travel and thus for aircraft,"" he told afp. if the biggest aircraft fleets are currently in the united states and europe, the biggest increases are expected in asia and the middle east, the consulting firm oliver wyman said in a recent study. ""flight shaming""airbus delivered 19 per cent of its planes to china, more than the united states, and this trend is not expected to change. in many emerging countries where the middle class is expanding air travel is becoming possible for more and more people. ""among asia's emerging nations, one of the greatest aspirational goals is simply the ability to fly internationally,"" said the center for aviation (capa). ""it is a sign of social and economic maturity and permits experiences which were unthinkable for their parents. ""it noted that these people were unlikely to share the growing sentiment among some people in the west towards reducing air travel to reduce one's carbon footprint. ""for these new would-be flyers, the whole concept of 'flight shaming' at a grass roots level is grossly alien,"" said capa. ""consequently, in asia flight shaming is unlikely to gain much traction,"" it added. the ""flight shaming"" or ""flygskam"" movement took off in sweden in 2018 to challenge the growing popularity of air travel, which had boomed in europe thanks to budget airlines that made weekend getaways across the continent affordable to a wider public. in 2019, air traffic declined by four percent in sweden but it hit a record across europe, according to the air traffic control body eurocontrol. ehess's ivaldi believes flight shaming will have little long-term impact. ""someone who makes one flight per year in a plane, do you really believe that they will say that it is too polluting and give it up?"" he said. but countries like sweden have begun to reintroduce night trains to give travellers greener options to travel. france, which is boosting its night trains, is also cutting domestic flights when it is possible to make the journey by train in under two and a half hours. ivaldi believes that to be a largely empty gesture as fast trains have already taken most of the market on such routes. the air sector has pledged to cut its carbon emissions in half by 2050 from their level in 2005. airlines have an economic incentive to do so, as adopting more fuel efficient planes reduces operating costs. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-14,Commentary: A precious chance to see my ageing mother in Germany after being separated by COVID-19.,"the pandemic has been particularly cruel to families separated by distance – with borders closed and travel tedious and costly, some never have the chance to hold their loved ones.  greg lim-lange is glad he had the chance. singapore: it is not normal for a son to ask: ""when is my mother going to die?"" or ""will i be able to see her before the inevitable fate that awaits us all sooner or later?""but i have had to ask this difficult question because like many people, i live thousands of miles away from my mother. i have lived here for 12 years, while my mother, who turns 85 this year, lives in germany. since the beginning of the pandemic, my singaporean wife and i had been waiting for countries to control the virus, for travel to ""normalise"", and to able to fly and meet her. but by may 2021, i hadn't seen her in almost two years. for those of us separated from families, there were windows of hope that could have enabled a trip home relatively low covid-19 numbers in singapore, a potential travel bubble via hong kong where business opportunities there mean we can avoid a lengthy quarantine after spending some time there, and vaccines being rapidly developed. but not only did numbers increase, the travel bubble burst twice, dashing many hopes.  the fluidity in the covid-19 situation has meant unpredictable changes to travel restrictions since last year. at the height of the pandemic for instance, singapore closed its borders to all short-term visitors.  this year, when the mutant strains raised infection numbers again, singaporeans and permanent residents had to test negative before flying back. even if we took the risk to travel, there was a nagging fear – what if during my travel, i catch the virus and then bring it home to my mum? or what if i pass it on to my wife? how long should i wait before it is safe – knowing that there would never really be a ""right time""?taking the risk to travelthe good news is vaccinations became available and my mother was first in line to receive her shots in freiburg, a small city nestled in the black forest in the south of germany.  i myself got fully vaccinated by may. the possibility of a trip came into sharper focus.  however, there were still logistical challenges and uncertainties involved in making the trip. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid. should i go alone or go together with my wife?  what if there is another outbreak and singapore changes entry re-entry requirements? how about work – we could not be away indefinitely and needed contingency plans. my wife and i decided to travel together.  it helped that we are self-employed and could do some work remotely. yet, shortly after we booked our tickets and just days before our departure, things took a turn for the worse.  germany went into a hard lockdown as numbers there spiralled.  the new and more contagious variants of the virus also arrived in singapore. germany required a negative pre-flight covid-19 test no earlier than 48 hours before arrival. with pcr tests taking up to two days to process, we scheduled not one but two tests to be taken just in case of a rare false positive.  it would be terrible to have come this far and then be turned around at the airport before we could enter germany. meanwhile the new restrictions in germany to stop transmission meant that all restaurants, shops, and hotels were closed and there was even a curfew in place from 10pm to 6am every night.  so again, there was the concern of being infected and the thought of whether we should still go or postpone came to mind. we had just 12 hours to decide.  all our covid-19 tests had come back negative and we stuck to what mattered most – using this opportunity to see my mother, who had been waiting for two years to be reunited with us. an eerie journeyit was an eerie journey through empty hallways at changi airport with personnel in full ppe, and always a niggling concern in the back of my mind whether we would be let through the immigration controls in germany. with a pandemic that throws up spikes in cases without warning, what was the chance of new regulations mid-flight barring all visitors or new quarantine requirements which so far had not been the case in germany?perhaps it was good that our anxieties were also hidden behind our masks that we were required to wear for the entire flight except for mealtimes.   this clearly wasn't joyful travelling as it used to be. in the end, the journey there went smoothly, the immigration officer glanced at our test results and apologised for the new restrictions and we got through immigration within minutes.  after a two-and-a-half-hour ride on a strangely empty autobahn, we arrived at my mother's home. she burst into tears of joy hugging me tightly after being separated for so long and my wife caught this moment of pure joy on camera. our journey to germany really brought home the point that we are wired to connect with our loved ones physically.  no video call can ever replace the feeling of being held by a loved one or the taste of a mother's meal. my mother had already been cooking our favourite dishes for a week before we arrived in anticipation. the return journeyonly a few days after arriving in germany, the compulsory 14-day quarantine in singapore was changed to 21 days. then there was a big cluster at changi airport and we started to worry if the airport might be closed under a new circuit breaker.  the following week we learned that non- singaporeans or prs would not be allowed to re-enter singapore until august. for some of our international friends currently travelling, that meant that they could not even return to their business or loved ones in singapore. my wife and i remained apprehensive about our journey home – our children were waiting for us.  we kept checking online if any new requirements cropped up before boarding our flight home. we made it back safely and changi airport was even emptier than we remembered.  well-organised as always, immigration and testing upon arrival went quite smoothly as a small army of helpful guides walked alongside us and directed us to every station we needed to pass, from immigration to swab test to our shuttle bus. was this arduous journey filled with twists, turns and worries worth it?i would say yes – my time with my mother was so very precious.  the two weeks we were there went by so quickly.  i didn't have the courage to tell her how much death was on my mind or how my fears of uncertainty were bothering me. i simply stayed with her, listened to her, ate all her lovingly prepared dishes and held her tight. i know we are very privileged to be able to spend the time and the money needed to see our loved ones. my heart goes out to the many more who are stuck in this pandemic limbo with one lockdown after another, still connecting using technology and yearning for the time they can take a trip to finally hold each other again. dr gregor lim-lange is the co-founder and chief psychologist of forest wolf an expert on clinical and positive psychology, social emotional intelligence and mental health.

re-enter singapore until august.', 'for some of our international friends currently travelling, that meant that they could not even return to their business or loved ones in singapore.', 'my wife and

safely and changi airport was even emptier than we remembered.', 'well-organised as always, immigration and testing upon arrival went quite smoothly as a small army of helpful guides walked alongside us and directed us to every station we needed to pass, from immigration to swab test to our shuttle bus.', 'was this arduous journey filled with twists, turns and worries worth it?i would say yes – my

""what i can say is that i made a different choice,"" wijnaldum said in saturday's news conference. ""it was a difficult choice.  we negotiated with barcelona for four weeks, but we have not come to an agreement.  psg was more decisive and faster.  the project also really appealed to me.  but it was difficult.  i have to say that i also thought i would go to barcelona.  that was the only club that was really interested in me for a long time. ""janusz michallik picks which potential transfer would have a greater impact in the premier league title race next season. manchester city are set to cool their interest in sporting's nuno mendes until after euro 2020.  the portugal left-back has been linked with the premier league champions since the transfer window opened, but the daily mail reports that a deal won't happen until after the conclusion of the tournament.  the 18-year-old is currently with the portugal squad as they prepare for their opening game against hungary. barcelona president joan laporta is keen to sign manchester city defender joao cancelo, claims mercato.  the report says that barca are interested in a player-exchange deal, with ousmane dembele rumoured as one who could go the other way.  the 27-year-old cancelo joined manchester city in 2019 and featured 28 times in pep guardiola's title-winning campaign last season. leeds united have identified borna barisic as a transfer target, according to football insider.  the left-back played a prominent role in steven gerrard's title win with rangers last season, starting 43 games while scoring four and assisting seven goals.  the 28-year-old is currently at euro 2020 where he is expected to start for croatia in defence. philip billing could return to the premier league with norwich city keen on a deal for the midfielder.  the mirror says that a fee in the region of £15m will be required to land the denmark international, who started 36 times in bournemouth's league campaign last season that saw the cherries fall short on their hopes for promotion. fc salzburg's patson daka is continuing to attract premier league interest and leicester city are the latest team to join the race.  the mirror reports that the foxes see the striker as an ideal replacement for jamie vardy for a fee in the region of £17m, though interest from liverpool and chelsea could see the austrian club raise their desired fee for their star man.

belgium's romelu lukaku celebrates scoring their third goal against russia at the gazprom arena, saint petersburg june 12, 2021.  — reuters pic

follow us on instagram and subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates. saint petersburg, june 13 — belgium striker romelu lukaku sent a message of support to his stricken inter milan team-mate christian eriksen after scoring, as his double helped the red devils open their euro 2020 campaign with a 3-0 win over russia on saturday. lukaku gave belgium an early lead in saint petersburg, then shouted ""chris, chris, stay strong — i love you"" into a pitchside camera during the celebration for his opening goal. his club team-mate eriksen is recovering in hospital in copenhagen after collapsing on the pitch during extraordinary scenes which overshadowed denmark's 1-0 home defeat by finland in saturday's earlier group b game. substitute thomas meunier doubled belgium's lead on 34 minutes before lukaku put the result beyond doubt with a late second goal. belgium, the world's top-ranked team, are under pressure to deliver at the european championship as some pundits claim this is roberto martinez's last chance to win a title with an ageing squad. yet even with manchester city playmaker kevin de bruyne and borussia dortmund midfielder axel witsel sidelined by injury, belgium were too strong for russia. the hosts got off to a bad start when andrei semenov failed to deal with a cross by dries mertens in the build-up to the opening goal. the ball fell to lukaku, who span away and drove his shot into the bottom far corner on 10 minutes. belgium's timothy castagne and russia's daler kuzyaev had to be helped off following a nasty clash of heads which saw both players substituted. meunier, castagne's replacement at right-back, grabbed belgium's second by slotting home the rebound after his dortmund team-mate thorgan hazard swung in a cross which anton shunin failed to hold. it stayed 2-0 at the break, but russia raised the tempo in the second half as roman zobnin fired over the belgian goal. real madrid star eden hazard replaced mertens for the final 18 minutes to lift the belgian attack. with two minutes left, lukaku swept meunier's pass into the russian net to claim his 20th goal in his last 15 international games. before kick-off, the belgium team were booed for taking a knee to highlight racial injustice, while their russian opponents stood. jeers echoed around the krestovsky stadium as the entire belgian team, as well as spanish referee antonio mateu lahoz, knelt, while lukaku, whose parents come from the democratic republic of congo, raised his right fist. england have said they will do the same for their opening game of the european championship against croatia on sunday. ex-nfl quarterback colin kaepernick started kneeling to protest against racial injustice in 2016. the gesture has become a familiar sight across a range of sports since george floyd, who was black, was killed by a white police officer in the united states last year.  — reutersloading. . . © 2021, malay mail, all rights reserved.

""we haven't had access to the laboratories to determine whether or not i've not reached a conclusion because our intelligence community is not certain yet whether or not this was. . .  from the market place of a bat interfacing with animals and the environment that caused this covid-19, or whether it was an experiment gone awry in a laboratory,"" he said. ""it's important to know the answer to that,"" mr biden told reporters at the conclusion of a group of seven leaders' summit in britain. the g-7 leaders had called for a transparent, science-based study, including in china, into the origins of covid-19, to be convened by the world health organisation. mr biden, meanwhile, said western democracies are in a race to compete with autocratic governments. ""we're in a contest, not with china per se. . .  with autocrats, autocratic governments around the world, as to whether or not democracies can compete with them in a rapidly changing 21st century,"" he told reporters. on china specifically, mr biden said: ""i think you're gonna see just straightforward dealing with china. ""as i've told (president) xi jinping myself, i'm not looking for conflict.  where we cooperate, we'll cooperate; where we disagree, i'm going to state this frankly, and we are going to respond to actions that are inconsistent,"" he said. italian prime minister mario draghi said the g-7 countries had to be frank about differences between the west and china in its post-summit communique that called out beijing on issues ranging from rights to the origins of the coronavirus. ""it's an autocracy that does not adhere to multilateral rules and does not share the same vision of the world that the democracies have,"" mr draghi told reporters on sunday after the summit in britain. ""we need to cooperate but we also need to be frank about things that we do not share and do not accept.  the us president said that silence is complicity,"" draghi said,about the origins of the covid-19 virus, president biden said last month he had ordered aides to find answers to the origin of the virus.  he asked for another update in 90 days. intelligence agencies in the us are considering two likely scenarios that the virus resulted from a laboratory accident or that it emerged from human contact with an infected animal but they have not come to a conclusion, mr biden said. a still-classified intelligence report circulated during former president donald trump's administration alleged that three researchers at china's wuhan institute of virology fell so ill in november 2019 that they sought hospital care, us government sources have said. china has strongly denied any of the three were ill or that the lab was the source of the pandemic. a who-led research mission on wuhan early this year concluded the sars-cov-2 virus most likely spilled over to humans from animals either directly from a bat or via another mammal, possibly one sold at the huanan seafood and fresh produce market in wuhan, the provincial capital of hubei. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

""the two new locally acquired cases are primary close contacts of existing cases, with no community exposure during their infectious period,"" victoria's health department said. australia's second most-populous state has recorded 94 cases in its latest wave of covid-19 infections, which triggered a two-week snap lockdown late last month.  victoria emerged from the lockdown on friday as new cases declined, but some physical-distancing rules remain. the state expects to announce further easing of covid-19 restrictions this week, acting premier james merlino said on sunday, as a strict two-week lockdown was successful in taming the virus. australia has fared much better than many other developed countries during the pandemic, with more than 22,300 local covid-19 cases and 910 deaths since march 2020, mostly in victorian aged-care homes.

""one had mild illness and the other severe.  the viral strains in both cats were very similar to human strains,"" said professor paul tambyah from the nus yong loo lin school of medicine. covid-19 infections in farmed mink have also been reported in at least 10 countries.  millions of the animals, which are valued for their fur, have been culled to prevent future spillover events to humans. a: there are very few reports of an animal passing covid-19 back to humans, though there were reports of mink farmers in northern europe infected by strains that moved from humans to mink and back to humans, said prof tambyah. the vast majority of the millions of sars-cov-2 infections have been human-to-human transmissions and it appears that animal-to-human transmission is extremely rare, he added. the world organisation for animal health (oie) said that animals do not play a significant role in the covid-19 pandemic, which is being sustained through human-to-human transmission. a: confirmed cases in cats and dogs are extremely rare and generally result in mild symptoms, said the world small animal veterinary association (wsava) in the united states.  no dog or cat is known to have died from the infection to date, it said. people with suspected or confirmed covid-19 infection should avoid contact with animals, including pets, livestock and wildlife, said the us centres for disease control and prevention (cdc). if you suspect your pet has covid-19, you can contact the national parks board's animal and veterinary services.  it conducts biosurveillance and is able to do the right kind of polymerase chain reaction testing for sars-cov-2 in animals, said prof tambyah. a: no.  prof tambyah said there are no licensed covid-19 vaccines for animals here. the wsava said there have been no cases in which a dog or a cat has been proven to transmit the virus to people.  there is no need for owners to consider vaccinating their pets against sars-cov-2 at this time, it said. ""as sars-cov-2 infection of dogs and cats most commonly originates from an infected human, the best way to protect a pet is to vaccinate the owners so that they are less likely to infect their pet,"" it said in a late april statement. in the us last year, veterinary pharmaceutical firm zoetis started development activities for a vaccine, based on initial concerns about sars-cov-2 in domestic animals. ""if regulatory authorities determine there is a need, we are prepared to act quickly to further develop our covid-19 vaccine for animals,"" ms christina lood, its senior director of innovation and sustainability communications, told st. a: the exact origins of sars-cov-2 are yet to be determined.  it could be many years before we know for sure. the common belief so far is that sars-cov-2 likely originated from bats, a known reservoir of coronaviruses, and jumped to humans through an unknown intermediary animal host, like a pangolin. still, a june 7 report by researchers from china west normal university and oxford university found that more than 47,000 live animals were sold at wuhan wet markets from may 2017 to november 2019, but no pangolins or bats were traded. there are other hypotheses, including the politically charged theory that sars-cov-2 was leaked from a laboratory in china. the oie estimates that at least 75 per cent of emerging infectious diseases affecting humans, including ebola, hiv and influenza, have an animal origin. a: the four wildlife parks here already have strict protocols, such as quarantining new animals, to prevent cross transmission of diseases from humans to animals under their care and vice versa, said a wildlife reserves singapore (wrs) spokesman. the covid-19 outbreak led to more measures, including the need for staff to wash their hands with soap and water before interacting with an animal, as well as donning face masks and gloves when working with an animal. they also minimise or avoid direct contact unless required, especially with higher-risk species such as primates and carnivores. ""as added preventive measures, our great apes such as the orangutans and chimpanzees also undergo temperature checks twice a day,"" said the wrs spokesman. he said the risk of humans contracting covid-19 from animals is very low. ""in addition, our veterinarians assess that due to the low number of community cases in singapore, coupled with the extra precaution we have taken to care for our animals, the risk of our animals contracting covid-19 is very low,"" he said. none of the zoo animals here has been infected with covid-19. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-14,Israel's Netanyahu ousted as 'change' coalition forms new govt.,"keep up to speed at a glance with the top 10 daily storiesa motley alliance of israeli parties on sunday ended benjamin netanyahu's 12 straight years as prime minister, as parliament voted in a new government led by his former ally, right-wing jewish nationalist naftali bennett. bennett, a tech millionaire and former special forces commander, was sworn in at the helm of an ideologically divided eight-party bloc united only by disdain for the country's longest-serving prime minister. netanyahu, 71, in typically combative style, vowed shortly before his defeat that ""if it's our destiny to be in the opposition, we'll do so with our heads high until we take down this bad government and return to lead the country our way"". beloved as ""king bibi"" and ""mr security"" by his right-wing supporters and condemned as the ""crime minister"" by his critics, netanyahu has long dominated israeli politics. but on sunday, a vote in the knesset legislature following weeks of political drama ended his government with a razor-thin majority of 60 to 59 in the 120-seat chamber. us president joe biden swiftly congratulated bennett. ""i look forward to working with prime minister bennett to strengthen all aspects of the close and enduring relationship between our two nations.  israel has no better friend than the united states,"" he said in a statement. delighted revelers packed a square near the knesset (parliament) in jerusalem and poured into tel aviv's city centre to celebrate netanyahu's fall. throngs of people gathered in the coastal city, clapping, cheering and waving flags. in tel aviv's rabin square, netanyahu's opponents launched into celebrations, waving ""bye bye bibi"" placards. fragile coalition -bennett, 49, told the knesset before the vote that his government ""represents all of israel"". he said the country, after four inconclusive elections in under two years, had been thrown ""into a maelstrom of hatred and in-fighting"". ""the time has come for different leaders, from all parts of the population, to stop, to stop this madness"", he said, to angry shouts of ""liar"" and ""criminal"" from right-wing opponents. netanyahu, who is battling corruption charges in a trial he dismisses as a conspiracy, has been the dominant israeli politician of his generation, having also served a previous three-year term in the 1990s. his supporters have hailed him as a defender of israel who has been tough on archfoe iran, but who also struck a series of historic normalisation deals with arab nations last year. being ousted from the top job leaves netanyahu more exposed to his legal troubles, denying him the chance to push through legislation that could give him immunity. bennett, a former defence minister under netanyahu, vowed to keep israel safe from iran, promising that ""israel won't let iran have nuclear weapons"", a goal the islamic republic denies pursuing. netanyahu claimed iran saw ""celebrating"" the birth of a ""dangerous"", weak left-wing government. the diverse anti-netanyahu bloc was cobbled together by the secular centrist yair lapid, a former tv presenter. it spans the political spectrum, with three right-wing, two centrist and two left-wing parties, and even an arab islamic conservative party. lapid, 57, is to serve as foreign minister for the next two years before taking over from bennett. german chancellor angela merkel on sunday congratulated bennett in comments tweeted by her spokeswoman: ""germany and israel are connected by a unique friendship that we want to strengthen further.  with this in mind, i look forward to working closely with you. ""canadian prime minister justin trudeau sent a message of congratulations, adding that ottawa ""remains steadfast in its commitment to a two-state solution, with israelis and palestinians living in peace, security, and dignity – without fear and with their human rights respected"". british foreign secretary dominic raab tweeted: ""i look forward to continued cooperation on security, trade and climate change, and working together to secure peace in the region. ""european council president charles michel also tweeted his congratulations. 'fraud' -the improbable alliance emerged weeks after an 11-day war between israel and hamas, the islamist group that rules the palestinian enclave of gaza, and following inter-communal violence in israeli cities with significant arab populations. netanyahu, a mastermind at navigating israel's fractious politics, had tried in vain to peel off defectors, hoping to deprive the nascent coalition of its hard-won majority. he accused bennett of ""fraud"" for siding with rivals.  angry rallies by the premier's likud party supporters resulted in security being bolstered for some lawmakers. as his grip on power slipped, netanyahu's bombastic remarks drew parallels to former us president donald trump, who described his election loss last year as the result of a rigged vote. sunday's knesset approval also came amid heightened tensions with the palestinians. right-wing israelis are also angered over last week's postponement of a controversial jewish nationalist march through flashpoint areas of east jerusalem. the ""march of the flags"" is now slated for tuesday, representing a key early test for the new government. gaza's rulers hamas said political developments in jerusalem wouldn't change their position on israel. ""the form the israeli government takes doesn't change the nature of our relationship,"" said the group's spokesman fawzi barhoum. ""it's still a colonising and occupying power that we must resist.

2021-06-14,"G-7 leaders agree on vaccines, China and taxing corporations.","carbis bay, england — leaders of the group of seven wealthy nations staked their claim sunday to leading the world out of the coronavirus pandemic and crisis, pledging more than 1 billion coronavirus vaccine doses to poorer nations, vowing to help developing countries grow while fighting climate change and backing a minimum tax on multinational firms. at the group's first face-to-face meeting in two years, the leaders dangled promises of support for global health, green energy, infrastructure and education — all to demonstrate that international cooperation is back after the upheavals caused by the pandemic and the unpredictability of former u. s.  president donald trump. during their three-day summit in southwest england, the g-7 leaders wanted to convey that the club of wealthy democracies — canada, france, germany, italy, japan, the united kingdom and the united states — is a better friend to poorer nations than authoritarian rivals such as china. ""this isn't about imposing our values on the rest of the world,"" british prime minister boris johnson told reporters at the end of the seaside summit on the rugged cornwall coast.  ""what we as the g-7 need to do is demonstrate the benefits of democracy and freedom and human rights to the rest of the world. ""u. s.  president joe biden, who was making his first foreign trip as leader, said it was an ""extraordinary, collaborative and productive meeting"" that showed ""america's back in the business of leading the world alongside nations who share our most deeply held values. ""but health and environmental campaigners were distinctly unimpressed by the details in the leaders' final communique. ""this g-7 summit will live on in infamy,"" said max lawson, the head of inequality policy at the international aid group oxfam.  ""faced with the biggest health emergency in a century and a climate catastrophe that is destroying our planet, they have completely failed to meet the challenges of our times. ""despite johnson's call to ""vaccinate the world"" by the end of 2022, the promise of 1 billion doses for vaccine-hungry countries — coming both directly and through donations to the international covax program — falls far short of the 11 billion doses the world health organization said is needed to vaccinate at least 70% of the world's population and truly end the pandemic. half of the billion-dose pledge is coming from the united states and 100 million from britain.  canada said it also would give 100 million doses, and france pledged 60 million.  altogether, the leaders said they pledged 870 million doses ""directly over the next year,"" with further contributions taking the total to the ""equivalent of over 1 billion doses. ""former british prime minister gordon brown said the lack of a more ambitious vaccination plan was ""an unforgivable moral failure. ""but biden said the leaders were clear that the commitments they made to donate doses wouldn't be the end.  the u. s.  president said getting shots into arms around the world was a ""gigantic, logistical effort"" and the goal might not be accomplished until 2023. the g-7 also backed a minimum tax of at least 15% on large multinational companies to stop corporations from using tax havens to avoid taxes, a move championed by the united states. biden also wanted to persuade fellow democratic leaders to present a more unified front to compete economically with beijing and strongly call out china's ""nonmarket policies and human rights abuses. ""the language on china in the g-7 leaders' communique from the meeting was more muted than the united states has used, but biden said he was satisfied.  on china's economic behavior, the group said it would ""consult on collective approaches to challenging non-market policies and practices which undermine the fair and transparent operation of the global economy. ""the leaders also said they would promote their values by calling on china to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms in xinjiang, where beijing is accused of committing serious human rights abuses against the uyghur minority, and in the semi-autonomous city of hong kong. not every european power has viewed china in as harsh a light as biden, who has painted the rivalry with the techno-security state as the defining competition of the 21st century. ""the g-7 is not a club hostile to china,"" french president emmanuel macron said.  ""it's an ensemble of democracies that (would) work with china on all world topics that china is ready to work on with us. ""johnson, the summit's host, wanted the three-day meeting to fly the flag for a ""global britain,"" his government's push to give the midsized country, newly detached from the european union, outsized global influence. yet brexit cast a shadow over that goal during the summit on the coast of southwest england.  european union leaders and biden voiced concerns about problems with new u. k. -eu trade rules that have heightened tensions in northern ireland. but overall, the mood was positive: the leaders smiled for the cameras on the beach at cliff-fringed carbis bay, a village and resort that became a traffic-clogged fortress for the meeting. the prime ministers and presidents also mingled with queen elizabeth ii at a royal reception, ate steak and lobster at a beach barbecue and watched an aeronautic display by the royal air force red arrows during their stay by the sea. america's allies were visibly relieved to have the u. s.  back as an engaged international player after the ""america first"" policy of the trump administration. johnson called biden ""a breath of fresh air. "" italian premier mario draghi said the president ""wanted to rebuild what were the traditional alliances of the united states after the period of trump, during which these alliances were seriously cracked. ""biden flew from the summit in carbis bay to have tea with the queen at windsor castle.  he is scheduled to attend a nato summit in brussels on monday and to hold talks with russian leader vladimir putin in geneva on wednesday. the g-7 also made ambitious declarations during their meetings about girls' education, preventing future pandemics and financing greener infrastructure globallyon climate change, the ""build back better for the world"" plan promises to offer financing for infrastructure — ""from railways in africa to wind farms in asia"" — to help speed up the global shift to renewable energy.  the plan is a response to china's ""belt and road"" initiative, which has increased beijing's worldwide influence. all g-7 countries have pledged to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, but many environmentalists say that will be too little, too late. naturalist david attenborough addressed the leaders by video sunday, warning that humanity is ""on the verge of destabilizing the entire planet. """"if that is so, then the decisions we make this decade — in particular the decisions made by the most economically advanced nations — are the most important in human history,"" the veteran documentary filmmaker said. as the leaders met behind fences and barbed wire, thousands of environmental protesters gathered throughout the weekend outside the ring of steel to accuse the g-7 of missing a chance to prevent climate catastrophe. members of the extinction rebellion climate activism group blocked the main road of the town of st.  ives on sunday, banging drums and sitting on the road.  elsewhere, hundreds of surfers and kayakers paddled out to sea to urge better protection for the world's oceans. ""g-7 is all greenwashing,"" protesters sang during one march.  ""we're drowning in promises, now's the time to act.

england — leaders of the group of seven wealthy nations staked their claim sunday to leading the world out of the coronavirus pandemic and crisis, pledging more than 1 billion coronavirus vaccine doses to poorer nations, vowing to help developing countries grow while fighting climate change and backing a minimum tax on multinational firms.', ""at the group's first face-to-face meeting in two years, the leaders dangled promises of support for global health, green energy, infrastructure and education — all to demonstrate that international cooperation is back after the upheavals caused by the pandemic and the unpredictability of former u. s.  president donald trump."", 'during their three-day summit in southwest england, the g-7 leaders wanted to convey that the club of wealthy democracies — canada, france, germany, italy, japan, the united kingdom and the united states — is a better friend to poorer nations than authoritarian rivals such as china.', '""this isn\'t about imposing our values on the rest of the world,"" british prime minister boris johnson told reporters at the end of the seaside summit on the rugged cornwall coast.', '""what we as the g-7 need to do is demonstrate the benefits of democracy and freedom and human rights to the rest of the world.', '""u. s.  president joe biden, who was making his first foreign trip as leader, said it was an ""extraordinary, collaborative and productive meeting"" that showed ""america\'s back in the business of leading the world alongside nations who share our most deeply held values.', '""but health and environmental campaigners were distinctly unimpressed by the details in the leaders\' final communique.', '""this g-7 summit will live on in infamy,"" said max lawson, the head of inequality policy at the international aid group oxfam.', '""faced with the biggest health emergency in a century and a climate catastrophe that is destroying our planet, they have completely failed to meet the challenges of our times.', '""despite johnson\'s call to ""vaccinate the world"" by the end of 2022, the promise of 1 billion doses for vaccine-hungry countries — coming both directly and through donations to the international covax program — falls far short of the 11 billion doses the world health organization said is needed to vaccinate at least 70% of the world\'s population and truly end the pandemic.', 'half of the billion-dose pledge is coming from the united states and 100 million from britain.', 'canada said it also would give 100 million doses, and france pledged 60 million.', 'altogether, the leaders said they pledged 870 million doses ""directly over the next year,"" with further contributions taking the total to the ""equivalent of over 1 billion doses.', '""former british prime minister gordon brown said the lack of a more ambitious vaccination plan was ""an unforgivable moral failure.', '""but biden said the leaders were clear that the commitments they made to donate doses wouldn\'t be the end.', 'the u. s.  president said getting shots into arms around the world was a ""gigantic, logistical effort"" and the goal might not be accomplished until 2023. the g-7 also backed a minimum tax of at least 15% on large multinational companies to stop corporations from using tax havens to avoid taxes, a move championed by the united states.', 'biden also wanted to persuade fellow democratic leaders to present a more unified front to compete economically with beijing and strongly call out china\'s ""nonmarket policies and human rights abuses.', '""the language on china in the g-7 leaders\' communique from the meeting was more muted than the united states has used, but biden said he was satisfied.', 'on china\'s economic behavior, the group said it would ""consult on collective approaches to challenging non-market policies and practices which undermine the fair and transparent operation of the global economy.', '""the leaders also said they would promote their values by calling on china to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms in xinjiang, where beijing is accused of committing serious human rights abuses against the uyghur minority, and in the semi-autonomous city of hong kong.', 'not every european power has viewed china in as harsh a light as biden, who has painted the rivalry with the techno-security state as the defining competition of the 21st century.', '""the g-7 is not a club hostile to china,"" french president emmanuel macron said.', '""it\'s an ensemble of democracies that (would) work with china on all world topics that china is ready to work on with us.', '""johnson, the summit\'s host, wanted the three-day meeting to fly the flag for a ""global britain,"" his government\'s push to give the midsized country, newly detached from the european union, outsized global influence.', 'yet brexit cast a shadow over that goal during the summit on the coast of southwest england.', 'european union leaders and biden voiced concerns about problems with new u. k. -eu trade rules that have heightened tensions in northern ireland.', 'but overall, the mood was positive: the leaders smiled for the cameras on the beach at cliff-fringed carbis bay, a village and resort that became a traffic-clogged fortress for the meeting.', 'the prime ministers and presidents also mingled with queen elizabeth ii at a royal reception, ate steak and lobster at a beach barbecue and watched an aeronautic display by the royal air force red arrows during their stay by the sea.', 'america\'s allies were visibly relieved to have the u. s.  back as an engaged international player after the ""america first"" policy of the trump administration.', 'johnson called biden ""a breath of fresh air.

2021-06-14,Biden suggests 'autocrat' Putin's Russia might be weaker than it seems.,"newquay, england: us president joe biden said on sunday (jun 13) that ""autocrat"" vladimir putin was right to say that relations were at their lowest point in years though he suggested that russia might be weaker than it seemed and that moscow had overreached in the middle east. biden used the g7 summit in the english seaside resort of carbis bay to argue that the world's richest democracies now faced an existential contest with ""autocrats"" that would define the 21st century. after attending a nato summit on monday, biden will meet putin on jun 16 in geneva for a meeting that promises to be a combative encounter after disputes over spying, hacking, election meddling, ukraine, belarus and human rights. biden, who called the former kgb spy a killer in march, cast russia as engaging in unacceptable behaviour on a range of fronts but also pointed to russia's own ""dilemmas"" its post-soviet economic collapse, what he called overreach in syria and problems with covid-19. asked why putin, who has served as russia's paramount leader since boris yeltsin resigned in 1999, had not changed despite years of western sanctions, biden quipped: ""he's vladimir putin"". ""autocrats have enormous power and they don't have to answer to a public and the fact is that it may very well be if i respond in kind, as i will, that it doesn't dissuade him he wants to keep going,"" biden said of putin. the two former cold war foes have had a turbulent relationship for years though relations soured after putin sought to rebuild some of the clout lost in the chaotic 1991 soviet collapse and began meddling far beyond russia's borders. us and other western leaders now see putin and xi jinping's china as their main strategic threats, though the kremlin dismisses as fiction almost all allegations against russia and says the west is gripped by anti-russian hysteria. the west casts russia as a dictatorial kleptocracy governed by a mercurial elite that has involved itself in irresponsible escapades such as the 2014 annexation of crimea, attempts to meddle in us and european elections, and a series of high-profile espionage and assassination attempts abroad. russia says putin is democratically elected. russian ""dilemmas""biden, though, depicted russia whose economy is 13 times smaller than the united states as weaker than it might be perceived. ""russia has its own dilemmas, dealing with its economy, dealing with covid-19 and dealing with not only the united states and europe writ large, and in the middle east,"" he said. ""russia has engaged in activities which we believe are contrary to international norms, but they have also bitten off some real problems, that they're going to have trouble chewing on,"" biden said. biden cited syria as a case in point and an area in which the two powers could work together to find ""an accommodation"". asked about a russian statement that moscow would be ready to hand over cyber criminals to the united states if washington followed suit, biden said that was a good sign and ""progress"". biden said putin was right that relations were at a low. ""he's right it's a low point,"" biden said. biden said he had told putin before being elected he would look at whether the russian leader had been involved in trying to interfere with the us election. ""i checked it out, so i had access to all the intelligence, he was engaged in those activities,"" he said. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-14,"Gas blast in China kills at least 12, rescue operation ongoing: Officials.","beijing: at least 12 people were killed and nearly 140 others injured when a gas line explosion ripped through a residential compound in central china's hubei province on sunday (jun 13), local officials said. rescue efforts were continuing, according to a statement from the disaster management bureau in the city of shiyan, although it was unclear how many people may still be trapped under the debris. the explosion took place at about 6. 30am and an investigation was under way to determine the cause of the blast, the statement said. responders sent 138 people to hospital, of which 37 were critically injured, according to a statement on the city's official website. videos shot by witnesses and verified by beijing news show several buildings reduced to rubble and rescue workers carrying shocked survivors on stretchers. the blast ripped through one of the city's vegetable markets that was filled with shoppers and local residents eating breakfast, an eyewitness told state-run global times. ""i heard a loud bang and immediately ducked under the table, thinking it was an earthquake,"" a man who owns a small restaurant near the explosion site told the newspaper. state broadcaster cctv showed footage of buildings with charred walls and shattered windows.  rescuers are seen raking through the debris with shovels and gloved hands. people can be seen walking in a rubble-strewn street between damaged buildings. images also show rescuers climbing over broken concrete slabs to reach those trapped inside. the blast occurred in a two-storey building that earlier housed a vehicle frame manufacturer. several survivors told local media that the gas pipeline had fallen into disrepair after the factory was moved last year. ""in march, workers from the gas company came and asked whether i got a smell of gas,"" one survivor who runs a stall in the market told local website health times. ""after asking around (with) people they just left. ""around 900 residents in the area have been evacuated as surrounding buildings may have been damaged by the blast, the city government said. about 2,000 rescue workers have been deployed on the site. images verified by health times show a firefighter who was also injured and a fire truck damaged by a second, smaller blast.  the severely injured were airlifted to bigger hospitals. long lines of volunteers were seen outside blood banks as local hospitals put out a call for donors. the ministry of emergency management has also sent a team to assist with the rescue operation. in a rare move, chinese president xi jinping issued a statement urging local officials to ""learn profound lessons from the incident"" and double down on efforts to prevent such incidents. ""all regions and relevant departments must draw lessons from one another . . .  investigate various safety hazards and prevent major emergencies,"" he said. industrial accidents are common in china due to weak safety standards and corruption among officials tasked with enforcing them. the blast came a day after eight people were killed and three others injured when toxic methyl formate leaked from a chemical handling facility in the southwestern city of guiyang. among the worst accidents was a massive 2015 explosion at a chemical warehouse in the port city of tianjin that killed 173 people, most of them firefighters and police officers.  the blast was blamed on illegal construction and unsafe storage of volatile materials. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-14,Taiwan president's ex-bodyguards sentenced in smuggling case.,"a taiwanese court on friday handed prison terms to a dozen former presidential security agents and airline employees over their roles in a cigarette smuggling scandal on the island two years ago. a bodyguard in president tsai ing-wen's entourage tried to bring in 9,800 cigarette cartons as he returned from an official trip accompanying tsai to the caribbean. the president said at the time that she had no idea her security team was involved and ordered an investigation. the agent, identified as wu tsung-hsien of the national security bureau, received the heaviest sentence of 10 years and four months on corruption and tax evasion charges, according to taipei district court. wu tried to pass the cigarettes off as cargo from tsai's presidential plane in an effort to smuggle them past customs, authorities said. it was later discovered that the scam was not a one-off when china airlines released figures showing huge amounts of duty-free cigarettes were routinely purchased during presidential visits. the defendants ""deprived the government of tax revenue, and seriously damaged the nation's image"", judge huang pei-chen told a virtual press conference. the value of duty evaded on the cigarettes amounted to nearly tw$8. 2 million ($273,000), according to the court. wu's colleague and main accomplice chang heng-chia was sentenced to 10 years and two months while six other ex-agents received jail terms ranging from six years and two months to seven years. four airline employees implicated in the scandal were handed prison terms ranging from two years to five years and four months. they can appeal the ruling. the bureau's internal investigation found that most agents bought a few dozen cartons of cigarettes into the island on the trip -- the majority ordering between 11 and 50 cartons. around 100 others involved in presidential security who have bought cigarettes into taiwan reached deferred prosecution agreements in 2019 and last year. taiwan's customs law limits travellers to a maximum of five cartons of cigarettes -- and only one can be tax-free. aw/axnit is compulsory to have your car insured in singapore.  why not make the most of it by looking for the best car insurance plan in town when your policy is up for renewal? while it can be tempting to simply renew your existing car [. . . ] the post 5 best car insurance plans in singapore (2021) appeared first on singsaver blog we compare, you save. newly-crowned french open champion barbora krejcikova hailed her mentor and former wimbledon champion jana novotna who died in 2017, saying: ""at the end of her life, i had to be there.

(nytimes) it's probably never been easier to acknowledge that a lot of us work too much and too hard, and should take more time off.  indeed, the very idea of burnout seems to be having a cultural moment. ""if you think you're burned out, you're burned out.  and if you don't think you're burned out, you're burned out,"" jill lepore wrote recently in the new yorker. to believe this is one thing, but to act on it is another.  for years, surveys have found that american workers tend not to use all of their vacation days.  and according to nordvpn teams, a provider of virtual private network technology that is important to remote work set-ups, the stay-at-home workforce created by lockdowns and office closures put in more hours on the job than before the pandemic. your biggest obstacle to getting time off is probably you: it can be hard to give yourself that permission to do nothing when there's just so much to do.  consider, however, that amazon's founder and ceo jeff bezos has said he sets aside ""puttering time"" every morning before taking any calls or meetings basically carving out a scheduled chunk of do-nothing time.  are you really that much busier than him?the point isn't just that it's nice to goof off every so often it's that it's necessary.  and that's true even if your ultimate goal is doing better work: downtime allows the brain to make new connections and better decisions.  multiple studies have found that sustained mental attention without breaks is depleting, leading to inferior performance and decision-making. in short, the prefrontal cortex where goal-oriented and executive-function thinking goes on can get worn down, potentially resulting in ""decision fatigue"".  a variety of research finds that even simple remedies like a walk in nature or a nap can replenish the brain and ultimately improve mental performance. these findings aren't just limited to academic studies.  in his recent book richer, wiser, happier, veteran financial journalist william green draws on many hours of interviews with highly successful investors, and, as you'd expect, a recurring theme is that these people tend to work hard, and out-think, out-research and out-hustle the crowd. but a counter-intuitive subtheme also emerges: how seriously his subjects tend to take breaks, time off and make space in their lives for definitive distance from the all-day, everyday 21st century work cycle.  many including mr charlie munger, mr warren buffett's long-time collaborator make a point to carve out time for quiet and contemplation.  for mr munger, that means ignoring up-to-the-second market news and crowd noise and instead exercising extreme patience. for another one of green's interviewees, ms laura geritz, ceo at rondure global advisors, it means taking time to sit by a stream and journal.  developing ""a regular meditation practice"", green notes, has become ""a mission-critical habit for many successful investors"".  this isn't an afterthought or a hobby or a personal wellness tactic, green said.  it's a reflection of the ""ruthless pragmatism"" that made his subjects successful in the first place in the eternal hunt for an edge, they found their rest ethic.  it's almost a ""counter-cultural"" move, green said.  ""i don't think you have deep thought without structuring your life this way,"" he said, at a time when everybody is constantly pinged and reacting to short-term stimuli. the good news is that at least some companies are starting to take breaks seriously.  for starters, some are acknowledging that unlimited paid time off, a popular gesture among employers who have tried to address the issue, doesn't really do the trick, says john fitch, the author with max frenzel of the 2020 book time off.  it can end up feeling like just another responsibility, and nobody wants to be the employee who takes the most days off. lately, companies including linkedin and roblox have experimented with mandatory vacation for all or most employees in the form of ""spring break"" periods.  actions like these that emphasise the value of time off represent a ""profound"" shift, fitch said.  he and frenzel, both tech entrepreneurs, are tinkering with a software tool that would help human resources departments prod workers to take days off. still, those companies are outliers, and most of us will have to take the initiative on an individual level.  given the natural resistance to downtime that many of us evidently feel, it might make sense to start small find a gateway drug equivalent to taking time off.  or, to use fitch's related metaphor, try micro-dosing breaks. one obvious place to start? unplugging.  the dream of a weeks-long ""digital detox"" may not be practical, but consider the ""technology shabbat"" strategy taking one day a week off from technology promoted by writer and filmmaker tiffany shlain, most recently in her book 24/6. for some, the advice to simply unplug or ""do nothing"" feels like a dead end; you need something to fill that space, or you just end up ruminating about work all over again.  fitch recommends an exercise called ""more of, less of"" periodically taking a chunk of time to list both what you want more of and less of in your life.  it's a ""higher altitude"" analysis to pull you out of the day-to-day rut of reacting to other people's stimuli and help you focus on what you need to create, and get rid of, in your life. similarly, if you add to your routine a simple walk around the block to clear your head, make sure you really clear it.  spending the whole time checking social media and monitoring your step count is not a quality break.  leave your phone behind, and make a point to notice something new and different on every walk.  turning the walk into a game ensures that your mind is engaged with the world rather than brooding about the work you're supposedly taking a break from. but wait don't such ideas sound kind of like another form of work? more goal-oriented tasks intended to boost productivity in the long run? is developing a rest ethic ultimately another job? perhaps so.  but then again, maybe that's the only language the unhealthily work-obsessed really understand. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-14,Shocking CCTV shows gang repeatedly drive into man.,"this is the moment a gang mowed down a man twice in a brutal attack. gang leader david 'porky' clark, 36, was driving a mercedes when he and his crew deliberately tried to run over the victim in ridley street, southwick, sunderland. as the man tried to flee in a silver hatchback, clark and the driver of a volvo rammed the car and smashed into another parked vehicle. he was hit twice by the cars and his vehicle rammed a further three times in the shocking attack on april 5, 2020. watch: moment gang repeatedly ran over man in brutal attackmoments later, clark – aided by shaun hewitt, shaun mcgregor and leigh coulson disarmed luke owen, who possessed a machete. owen was then stabbed with the machete in the middle of the street, leaving him with serious leg injuries and cuts to his face. earlier on the same evening, clark's girlfriend coulson threatened an occupant on the same street as the attack. she told the victim he would be ""burnt to a crisp"" and said a car would be driven through his living room. a vehicle was reversed into the front door of the address and set on fire later that night. all five gang members, from sunderland, admitted a string of offences at newcastle crown court in february. on friday ringleader clark was jailed for 44 months after he admitted assault, dangerous driving and violent disorder. coulson, 33, pleaded guilty to violent disorder and threats to commit criminal damage by fire and received a 12-month suspended sentence. hewitt, 29, mcgregor, 32, and owen, 34, all admitted violent disorder and owen also pleaded guilty to possession of an offensive weapon. hewitt was jailed for one year, mcgregor was jailed for 15 months and owen received an 11-month sentence suspended for 12 months. detective inspector andy richardson, of northumbria police, said: ""the violence that we saw on the streets of southwick that night was appalling and all five defendants should be ashamed of themselves. ""the series of incidents unfolded in a residential area where families watched on in shock – and they will no doubt have been horrified to see this level of offending justyards from their front door. ""clark was at the centre of the disorder and is somebody who has consistently shown a total disregard for the law.

""â¢ germany's health ministry said johnson & johnson must deliver 6. 5 million vaccine doses to the country in july to make up for a shortfall expected in june.  the demand comes after the u. s.

another wave of the virus.  russia on sunday reported 14,723 new covid-19 cases, including 7,704 in moscow, the largest one-day national caseload since february 13. the number of new infections in moscow was the most reported in one day since december 24.  the city's mayor told residents on saturday to stay off work this coming week, if they can, to curb the spread of the virus. the surge has been blamed in part on a vaccine-reluctant population, with some surveys suggesting that most russians do not want to take sputnik v despite trials and tests proving the vaccine effective and safe.  in a promising sign for the country's vaccination program, the scientist who led the development of sputnik v has tested a nasal spray form of its covid-19 vaccine.  the product is reportedly suitable for children aged 8-12 and could be launched in september.  g7 the g7 countries announced they would provide a billion covid-19 vaccine doses over the next year and work with the private sector, the

2021-06-14,"EU adds another rare blood condition as side effect of AstraZeneca shot, World News.","europe's drug regulator on friday (june 11) identified another very rare blood condition as a potential side effect of astrazeneca's covid-19 vaccine and said it was looking into cases of heart inflammation after inoculation with all coronavirus shots. the european medicines agency's (ema) safety committee said that capillary leak syndrome (cls) must be added as a new side effect to labelling on astrazeneca's vaccine, known as vaxzevria. people who had previously sustained the condition, where fluids leak from the smallest blood vessels causing swelling and a drop in blood pressure, should not receive the shot, the ema added. the regulator first began looking into these cases in april and the recommendation adds to astrazeneca's woes after its vaccine was associated with very rare and potentially lethal cases of blood clotting that come with a low platelet count. last month, the ema had advised against giving a second astrazeneca shot to people with that clotting condition, known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (tts). the committee reviewed six validated cases of cls in people, mostly women, who had received vaxzevria, including one death.  three had a history of the condition. more than 78 million vaxzevria doses have been administered in the european union, liechtenstein, iceland & norway and britain. in a statement, astrazeneca pointed to the extreme rarity of cls cases, at less than 1 in 10 million vaccinated individuals. ""we are working actively, in collaboration with regulatory authorities, on risk minimization measures. . .  that includes information to those being vaccinated. . . information to drive early diagnosis and intervention, and appropriate treatment,"" the company said. britain's regulator, the mhra said it was considering precautionary advice for people with a history of cls but does not see a causal link with the vaccine. two of eight reports of capillary leak syndrome following astrazeneca vaccination in the uk were in people with a history of the condition, and 40 million doses of the vaccine had been given, it said. separately, the ema said it was continuing its probe into cases of heart inflammation known as myocarditis and pericarditis, primarily following inoculation with the pfizer/biontech, and moderna mrna shots, but also after the j&j and astrazeneca vaccines. u. s.  health officials said on thursday they had registered a higher-than-expected number of heart inflammation cases in young men who received a second dose of the mrna shots, though a causal relationship could not be established. israel's health ministry said this month it had found a likely link to the condition in young men who received the pfizer/biontech shot. both pfizer and moderna have acknowledged the observations but said a causal association with their vaccines has not been established. biontech said adverse events, including myocarditis and pericarditis, are being regularly and thoroughly reviewed by the companies and regulatory authorities. ""more than 300 million doses of the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine have been administered globally and the benefit risk profile of our vaccine remains positive. ""the united states and israel have been months ahead of the eu in vaccinating men below 30, who are particularly prone to heart inflammation, giving them potentially more cases to analyse.

""we have a bilateral relationship that has deteriorated to its lowest point in recent years,"" mr putin said, according to an nbc translation of excerpts of an interview broadcast on friday. he praised former president donald trump and said mr biden, as a career politician, was ""radically different"" from mr trump, but also voiced hope that the new us leader will be less impulsive than his predecessor. ""it is my great hope that, yes, there are some advantages, some disadvantages, but there will not be any impulse-based movements on behalf of the sitting us president,"" he said. ""i believe that former us president trump is an extraordinary individual, talented individual. . .  he is a colourful individual.  you may like him or not.  but he didn't come from the us establishment,"" mr putin was quoted as saying. mr biden plans to raise a range of us complaints, including over purported interference in american elections and hacking by russia, in the summit with mr putin, at the end of the new us president's first foreign trip. mr putin had openly admitted that in the 2016 vote he supported mr trump, who had voiced admiration for the russian leader and notoriously, at their first summit, appeared to accept his denials of election interference. asked about mr biden calling him a killer in an interview in march, mr putin said he had heard dozens of such accusations.  ""this is not something i worry about in the least,"" mr putin said. he added that the term ""killer"" was part of ""macho behaviour"" common in hollywood. such discourse ""is part of us political culture where it's considered normal.  by the way, not here, it is not considered normal here"", the russian president said. mr biden, at the start of an eight-day visit to europe this week, said: ""we're not seeking conflict with russia. """"we want a stable and predictable relationship. . .  but i've been clear: the united states will respond in a robust and meaningful way if the russian government engages in harmful activities. ""mr putin was asked about several russian dissidents whose deaths have been blamed on moscow, including former kgb spy alexander litvinenko who was poisoned in 2006. the russian leader dismissed the question as ""verbal indigestion"".  he said some of those responsible for the deaths are in prison. on the issue of recent ransomware attacks that the us has traced to russia, mr putin denied any knowledge of the hackings and called on mr biden to reach an agreement with him on cyberspace, nbc news said. mr putin also dismissed a report in the washington post last week that russia was preparing to supply iran with an advanced satellite that would enable it to track potential military targets across the middle east. ""it's just fake news.  at the very least, i don't know anything about this kind of thing,"" mr putin said, according to nbc news.  ""it's just nonsense garbage.

2021-06-14,"Who is Naftali Bennett, Israel's incoming PM?.","jerusalem: naftali bennett, who was sworn in sunday (jun 13) asisrael's new prime minister, embodies many of the contradictions that define the 73-year-old nation. he's a religious jew who made millions in the mostly secular hi-tech sector; a champion of the settlement movement who lives in a tel aviv suburb; a former ally of benjamin netanyahu who has partnered with centrist and left-wing parties to end his 12-year rule. his ultranationalist yamina party won just seven seats in the 120-member knesset in march elections the fourth such vote in two years.  but by refusing to commit to netanyahu or his opponents, bennett positioned himself as kingmaker.  even after one member of his religious nationalist party abandoned him to protest the new coalition deal, he ended up with the crown. here's a look at israel's next leader:an ultranationalist with a moderate coalitionbennett has long positioned himself to the right of netanyahu.  but he will be severely constrained by his unwieldy coalition, which has only a narrow majority in parliament and includes parties from the right, left and centre. he is opposed to palestinian independence and strongly supports jewish settlements in the occupied west bank and east jerusalem, which the palestinians and much of the international community see as a major obstacle to peace. bennett fiercely criticised netanyahu after the prime minister agreed to slow settlement construction under pressure from president barack obama, who tried and failed to revive the peace process early in his first term. he briefly served as head of the west bank settler's council, yesha, before entering the knesset in 2013.  bennett later served as cabinet minister of diaspora affairs, education and defence in various netanyahu-led governments. ""he's a right-wing leader, a security hard-liner, but at the same time very pragmatic,"" said yohanan plesner, head of the israel democracy institute, who has known bennett for decades and served with him in the military. he expects bennett to engage with other factions to find a ""common denominator"" as he seeks support and legitimacy as a national leader. rivalry with netanyahuthe 49-year-old father of four shares netanyahu's hawkish approach to the middle east conflict, but the two have had tense relations over the years. bennett served as netanyahu's chief of staff for two years, but they parted ways after a mysterious falling out that israeli media linked to netanyahu's wife, sara, who wields great influence over her husband's inner circle. bennett campaigned as a right-wing stalwart ahead of the march elections and signed a pledge on national tv saying he would never allow yair lapid, a centrist and netanyahu's main rival, to become prime minister. but when it became clear netanyahu was unable to form a ruling coalition, that's exactly what bennett did, agreeing to serve as prime minister for two years before handing power to lapid, the architect of the new coalition. netanyahu's supporters have branded bennett a traitor, saying he defrauded voters.  bennett has defended his decision as a pragmatic move aimed at unifying the country and avoiding a fifth round of elections. a generational shiftbennett, a modern orthodox jew, will be israel's first prime minister who regularly wears a kippa, the skullcap worn by observant jews.  he lives in the upscale tel aviv suburb of raanana, rather than the settlements he champions. bennett began life with his american-born parents in haifa, then bounced with his family between north america and israel, military service, law school and the private sector.  throughout, he's curated a persona that's at once modern, religious and nationalist. after serving in the elite sayeret matkal commando unit, bennett went to law school at hebrew university.  in 1999, he co-founded cyota, an anti-fraud software company that was sold in 2005 to us-based rsa security for us$145 million. bennett has said the bitter experience of israel's 2006 war against the lebanese militant group hezbollah drove him to politics.  the monthlong war ended inconclusively, and israel's military and political leadership at the time was widely criticised as bungling the campaign. bennett represents a third generation of israeli leaders, after the founders of the state and netanyahu's generation, which came of age during the country's tense early years marked by repeated wars with arab states. ""he's israel 3. 0,"" anshel pfeffer, a columnist for israel's left-leaning haaretz newspaper, wrote in a recent profile of bennett. ""a jewish nationalist but not really dogmatic.  a bit religious, but certainly not devout.  a military man who prefers the comforts of civilian urban life and a high-tech entrepreneur who isn't looking to make any more millions.  a supporter of the greater land of israel but not a settler.  and he may well not be a lifelong politician either.

A racket from his idol.,"novak djokovic didn't throw his racket to the sky after rallying for a five-set victory in the french open final.  he didn't tuck it away as a cherished souvenir, either. instead, djokovic walked over to the roland garros stands and handed it to a youngster who was part coach, part fan and all heart during the match with stefanos tsitsipas.  the boy was delirious with disbelief and joy, the moment one of those purely celebratory sports encounters between superstar and fan. afterward, djokovic explained that his gesture was a reward to a fan who had remained in his corner even when he lost the first two sets and appeared headed for defeat.  he didn't say it, but perhaps it was also djokovic's acknowledgment that he isn't always a fan favorite. ""i don't know the boy, but he was in my ear the entire match, basically.  especially when i was two-sets-to-love down, he was encouraging me; he was actually giving me tactics as well,"" djokovic told reporters with a laugh.

2021-06-14,Johnson defends G7 deal amid criticism of final communique.,"green campaigners and anti-poverty groups say cornwall summit failed to address challenges facing the world last modified on sun 13 jun 2021 18. 59 edtboris johnson has sought to defend the deal struck by g7 leaders at the cornwall summit, as green groups and anti-poverty campaigners said the rich nations' club had failed to match the scale of the challenges facing the world. the final communique contained no early timetable to eradicate coal-fired emissions, offered only 1bn extra coronavirus vaccines for the world's poor over the next 12 months and made no new binding commitments to challenge china's human rights abuses. campaigners expressed profound disappointment at the failure to attach new cash to the communique's aspirations to end the pandemic, ""build back better"" and tackle the climate emergency. oxfam's head of inequality policy, max lawson, said: ""never in the history of the g7 has there been a bigger gap between their actions and the needs of the world.  we don't need to wait for history to judge this summit a colossal failure, it is plain for all to see. ""british officials said the task of a g7 summit was to set out a policy roadmap rather than make binding, detailed financial commitments, which are more likely to be made at the g20 or at the un climate change summit in november. the former uk prime minister gordon brown said the g7's 2021 summit would be remembered ""only for a colossal failure to honour boris johnston's promise to vaccinate the world, an unforgivable moral failure when covid is destroying lives at the rate of one-third of a million every month"".  he echoed the world health organization's view that the g7 had needed to commit to distribute 11bn vaccines, and not just 1bn.  he said he was also disappointed the group had not supported compulsory patent transfers to boost production in africa. johnson said at the close of the summit that he hoped it had lived up to the optimistic hopes and predictions.  he knew ""the world was looking to us to reject some of the selfishness and the nationalistic approaches that marred the initial early responses to the pandemic, and channel all our economic and scientific might into defeating covid"", he said. he rejected brown's criticisms, saying the g7 had set a target to vaccinate the whole world by the end of the year.  he said of the 1. 5bn vaccines around the world, 500m were the result of the uk government's deal with oxford/astrazeneca. the shadow foreign secretary, lisa nandy, said: ""by every measure, the prime minister's summit has come up short.  no clear plan to vaccinate the world by the end of 2022.  no ambitious commitments to place the world on the path to climate safety. ""this should have been the summit that delivered health, environmental and economic security for people in britain and across the world. ""with less than six months until cop 26, the government must raise the ambition and work constructively with countries across the world to deliver for people in britain and around the world. ""joe biden said the us was back at the table, and that washington might be able to find a further 1bn doses next year.  fighting pandemics ""may be a constant project for a long time,"" the us president said. the one campaign, however, said the who and other major multilateral bodies had set the g7 clear targets before the summit, which it had not met.  the who called at the weekend for 70% of the global population to be vaccinated by time of the g7's next summit in germany next year.  but one said the money would only ""provide enough doses to vaccinate around 200 million people . . .  by the end of the year.  by the next g7 summit only 10. 3% of the population in low and medium income countries would be vaccinated by this deal. ""johnson also came under attack over the climate crisis.  green groups said the g7 had agreed ""to plan to make a plan"". johnson said the g7 was committed to the net zero emissions target by 2050, and had made significant steps towards the pledge of $100bn a year in climate finance for developing countries first made at the copenhagen summit. but greenpeace uk's executive director, john sauven, said: ""despite the green soundbites, boris johnson has simply reheated old promises and peppered his plan with hypocrisy, rather than taking real action to tackle the climate and nature emergency. ""the us was unable to secure a g7 consensus on china, but instead put out a separate statement on the use of forced labour in xinjiang.  the final communique made reference to keeping the taiwan strait open, the loss of democracy in hong kong and ""called on china to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, especially in relation to xinjiang"".  some g7 leaders, notably germany's angela merkel, cautioned against alienating china at a time when beijing's help is needed to tackle climate change. biden defended the commitments.  ""we are in a contest not with china per se but with autocrats around the world, and whether democracies can compete them in a rapidly changing world,"" he said.  he called for a further inquiry into the origins of the pandemic, saying ""it is important to know if this is due to a trial that went awry in a laboratory.  we have not had access to their laboratories. ""johnson said his official advice had been that it was unlikely the virus had spread from a leak in a chinese lab, but that ""anyone sensible would keep an open mind about it"".  asked about him being more ideologically in tune with donald trump than biden, johnson said there were ideological similarities between his plans to level up and the democrat's us infrastructure programme. the summit marked the return of in-person diplomacy after a near two-year hiatus and the departure of trump's chaotic style that effectively brought the g7 to a standstill. merkel praised biden, saying he had brought new momentum to the g7's efforts to tackle global challenges. ""it's not like the world no longer has any problems because of the election of joe biden as us president,"" she told reporters.  ""but we can work on solutions to those problems with new momentum.  and i think it's very good that we have become more concrete at this g7.

2021-06-14,"157 suspected serious reactions to Covid-19 jabs reported out of nearly 3.7 million doses given in Singapore, Singapore News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore there have been 157 reports here of suspected reactions to the covid-19 vaccine severe enough to be life-threatening or result in hospitalisation, among other serious conditions. however, no deaths have been linked to the jab, the health sciences authority (hsa) said on friday (june 11). these ""suspected serious adverse events"" made up 0. 004 per cent of the almost 3. 7 million doses of pfizer-biontech and moderna jabs administered till may 23. these serious cases form part of the 4,704 ""suspected adverse events reports"" that hsa received till may 23. this translates into 0. 13 per cent of administered doses, which is consistent with the percentage that had been reported by the authority on may 6, when it last gave an update on the safety record of both mrna vaccines on may 6. these reactions are suspected to be associated with the vaccinations, but may not have been caused by them. an adverse event  or reaction related to vaccination is any undesirable medical condition that occurs after taking the vaccine, which does not necessarily have a direct link to the treatment.  they may be coincidental or related to an undiagnosed disease, but have to be reported by healthcare providers to hsa. reactions are considered serious if they result in hospitalisation, disability or life-threatening illnesses, among other things. anaphylaxis, which is the rapid onset of severe allergic reactions, was the most frequently reported serious adverse event, with 26 such cases.  all of them recovered after medical treatment, hsa said. it added that the incidence rate of anaphylaxis reported here with the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines is about 0. 85 cases for every 100,000 doses of the jabs administered.  ""this is similar to the incidence rates reported overseas of around 0. 5 to two per 100,000 doses administered,"" said hsa. other severe allergic reactions numbered 23.  these include breathing difficulty, fast heart rate, an increase or decrease in blood pressure, chest discomfort and pain, fainting, limb numbness and weakness or pain, changes in vision, increase in liver enzymes, joint pain, fits, ringing in the ears and infections. the authority said most of those who had developed serious adverse events have recovered or are recovering.  ""these serious adverse events are being closely monitored by hsa,"" it added. hsa said that the most commonly reported reactions are consistent with those typically observed following vaccination. from the 4,704 reactions, the most common one was cases of rash, which accounted for more than one in four reported adverse events.  this was followed by cases of swelling of eyelids, face or lips, which occurred in about one in seven cases. these are typically resolved within a few days and are in line with the events described in the covid-19 vaccines product information, as well as those reported overseas. most of adverse events were associated with the pfizer-biontech vaccine, which was rolled out for use here on dec 30 last year and comprised 83 per cent of the doses administered.  moderna was deployed on march 12 this year. about 68 per cent of the total number of reactions reported was among people below the age of 60. hsa pointed out that trials of the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines found that those younger than 60 tend to experience more adverse effects occurring soon after vaccination, compared with those older. generally, younger people have more active immune responses and may experience more adverse effects to the vaccines, said hsa.  it pointed out that this is part of the body's natural response to build immunity against covid-19 infection. the authority added that 64 per cent of these reactions were reported in females. its update also noted that a greater frequency of heart attacks and strokes has not been observed in vaccinated persons locally. this comes after it was announced on friday that six people have been reported to have suffered heart inflammation after receiving covid-19 vaccines four of whom were men aged below 30. as a precaution, experts have advised that vaccinated people, especially adolescents and younger men, should avoid strenuous physical activity for one week after their second dose. ""it is important to note that heart attacks and strokes can occur naturally within our population, regardless of whether people are vaccinated or not,"" said hsa. ""due to the large numbers of people being vaccinated, it is expected that, by coincidence, some individuals may experience other medical events such as heart attacks and strokes in the days or weeks after vaccination which may not be related to the vaccination. ""hsa said it is monitoring the incidence of anaphylaxis and bell's palsy, which are adverse events historically reported with vaccines. there have been 45 reported cases of bell's palsy, which causes temporary weakness or paralysis of facial muscles.  most of the cases were not serious, hsa said, and patients will generally have completely recovery even without treatment. the incidence rate for this reaction in singapore is estimated to be 3. 35 per 100,000 persons per month.  hsa said that this is within the background incidence of 1. 1 to 4. 4 per 100,000 persons per month before the introduction of vaccination. the authority said that it, along with the ministry of health, will continue to monitor the safety of covid-19 vaccines closely and update the public on any significant safety concerns detected with the vaccines. overall, the benefits of the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines continue to outweigh the known risks of covid-19 disease and its severe complications in a pandemic, hsa added. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

""we will also extend free covid-19 testing to members of the public who had visited the shops at 115 and 116 bukit merah view between may 25 and jun 12,"" said moh. all visitors to the two locations between those dates were advised to monitor their health closely and minimise social interactions as far as possible for 14 days from the date of their visit, said moh. they should see a doctor immediately if they feel unwell, it added. all four cases were placed on quarantine earlier as they were identified as close contacts of case 64132, a 74-year-old worker at a sundry store in the market who was confirmed to have covid-19 on jun 9. the new cases involved a 50-year-old bangladeshi man who is a conservancy worker employed by theng liang lee services (case 64187) and a 72-year-old singaporean man working at a sundry shop (case 64193). two food stall vendors were also among the cases a 67-year-old singaporean woman (case 64195) and a 65-year-old singaporean man (case 64196). their infections were detected when they tested positive for covid-19 during quarantine. all were asymptomatic, except for case 64193.  he developed a runny nose on jun 13 while on quarantine, after his covid-19 result came back positive. cases 64193, 64195 and 64196 were fully vaccinated. moh said it was investigating six cases of covid-19 infection among individuals working at the market.  they were the four new cases on sunday, case 64132 and case 64158 an 82 year-old singaporean woman who regularly helped out at a sundry store there. ""our epidemiological investigations have found that there is likely ongoing transmission among individuals who work at the location,"" said moh. new cluster linked to engineeranother new cluster comprising an unlinked community case and two linked community cases was identified on sunday. the unlinked case, case 64184, was a 27-year-old indian engineer working at ecoxplore.  he was tested for covid-19 on jun 10 as part of rostered routine testing.  he developed fever that same day. the man's pooled test result came back positive on jun 11, and an individual test confirmed his infection on jun 12.  his serology test was negative. the two linked community cases were his household contacts and detected through surveillance. one was a 19-year-old singaporean teenager working as a warehouse assistant at dhl express (singapore). she developed a fever, sore throat, cough and runny nose on jun 10 and sought medical treatment at a polyclinic on jun 11, where she received an antigen rapid test (art) and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test. she was immediately isolated when her art result came back positive, and her pcr test result also came back positive that same day.  her serology test result was negative. the other linked case was a 39-year-old woman employed by cleen first services as a cleaner at emerald park condominium. she developed a fever on jun 11 and sought medical treatment at a polyclinic on jun 12, where she was given an art and a pcr test. her art result came back positive and she was immediately isolated.  her pcr test result came back positive that same day.  her serology test result was negative. unlinked case involving nursing aidethe second unlinked community case was a 23-year-old indian nursing aide working at all saints home (hougang), a nursing home for the elderly. he was asymptomatic, and his infection was detected when he was tested for covid-19 on jun 11 as part of the nursing home's surveillance testing for staff members. his pooled test result came back positive on jun 11.  an individual test done that same day came back negative on jun 11, but another done on jun 12 came back positive.

2021-06-14,"England’s bold choices pay off: Richard Buxton, Latest Football News.","england manager gareth southgate may have just altered the course of the three lions' euro 2020 history. no team have played in as many european championship games as england who are making their 10th finals appearance without ever reaching the final. until last night's 1-0 win over croatia in their group d opener, the class of 2021 appeared destined to become the latest chapter of a seemingly never-ending hard luck story of self-defeatism. but with a mix of bold choices and selection gambles, southgate might have changed that. raheem sterling's 57th-minute strike, pouncing onto a through-ball from influential leeds united midfielder kalvin phillips, breathed new life into a flagging three lions team who had resolutely attempted to take the game to their ageing visitors in the first half. the manchester city forward's inclusion in the starting line-up itself had already sparked consternation, with southgate lambasted before the game for choosing a player who had grown up in the shadow of wembley, ahead of jack grealish and jadon sancho. yet, the england manager's gamble paid off handsomely as he ended an unflattering sequence of nine winless opening group salvos in the continent's flagship tournament. he refused to bow to public pressure and persevered with a player whose track record of scoring for his country had produced a flawless return of 10 previous victories. southgate can also claim vindication for favouring protectionism over panache with kieran trippier's rare deployment at left-back raising eyebrows and questions alike. prior to staring down zlatko dalic's charges, he had played in the role on just four previous occasions, with the previous weekend's friendly win over austria the most recent. having the inside knowledge to nullify atletico madrid teammate sime vrsaljko, operating on the right side of defence, saw trippier chosen over the in-form duo of luke shaw and ben chilwell. hindsight suggests that southgate's boldness reaped a deserved reward as trippier rarely appeared troubled by croatia's three-pronged attack while right-back kyle walker recovered from a shaky first-half to shackle ivan perisic and josko gvardiol. for a time, this maiden group d encounter was in danger of following a similar pattern for england. as the clock ticked down towards the interval, phil foden's early effort that crashed against the base of dominik livakovic's right-hand post increasingly faded from memory with luka modric and mateo kovacic taking turns to wrest back control from their hosts. once temperatures soared at england's national stadium, however, the black-shirted croatians wilted.  they struggled to contain the omnipotent threat posed by sterling, phillips as well as second-half substitutes marcus rashford and jude bellingham. southgate's willingness to trust his instincts has further shifted the perception of the englishman, who has made the job his own these past 41⁄2 years. before last night, no england manager had the presence of mind to field a starting line-up devoid of liverpool or manchester united players at a major tournament, since the euro 1992 clash against against france. refusing to pander solely to representatives of the english premier league's traditional big six is an indication of southgate's willingness to place his hopes in the new brightest and best. that should mean more minutes for the likes of phillips, aston villa's tyrone mings the first villan to start for england at the euros since southgate himself played against germany in 1996 and west ham united midfielder declan rice. full-throated renditions of ""football's coming home"" at the final whistle may still be somewhat premature but england have never been in a stronger position to deliver. get the new paper on your phone with the free tnp app.  download from the apple app store or google play store

2021-06-14,"Israel swears in new coalition, ending Netanyahu's long rule.","jerusalem: israel's parliament on sunday (jun 13) narrowly approved a new coalition government, ending the historic 12-year rule of prime minister benjamin netanyahu and sending the polarising leader into the opposition. naftali bennett,a former ally of netanyahu turned rival, became prime minister after the 60-59 vote.  promising to try to heal a divided nation, bennett will preside over a diverse and fragile coalition comprised of eight parties with deep ideological differences. but the 71-year-old netanyahu made clear he has no intention of exiting the political stage.  ""if it is destined for us to be in the opposition, we will do it with our backs straight until we topple this dangerous government and return to lead the country,"" he said. the vote, capping a stormy parliamentary session, ended a two-year cycle of political paralysis in which the country held four deadlocked elections.  those votes focused largely on netanyahu's divisive rule and his fitness to remain in office while on trial for corruption charges. to his supporters, netanyahu is a global statesman uniquely capable of leading the country through its many security challenges. but to his critics, he has become a polarising and autocratic leader who used divide-and-rule tactics to aggravate the many rifts in israeli society.  those include tensions between jews and arabs, and within the jewish majority between his religious and nationalist base and his more secular and dovish opponents. outside the knesset, hundreds of protesters watching the vote on a large screen erupted into applause when the new government was approved.  thousands of people, many waving israeli flags, gathered in central tel aviv's rabin square to celebrate. president joe biden quickly congratulated the new government. ""i look forward to working with prime minister bennett to strengthen all aspects of the close and enduring relationship between our two nations,"" he said in a statement after a g7 meeting in england wrapped up.  he said his administration is fully committed to working with the new government ""to advance security, stability, and peace for israelis, palestinians, and people throughout the broader region. ""bennett tweeted: ""thank you mr president! i look forward to working with you to strengthen the ties between our two nations. ""much of the opposition to netanyahu was personal.  three of the eight parties in the new government, including bennett's yamina, are headed by former netanyahu allies who share his hard-line ideology but had deep personal disputes with him. bennett, 49, is a former chief of staff to netanyahu whose small party is popular with religious jews and west bank settlers.  as he addressed the raucous debate, he was repeatedly heckled and shouted down by netanyahu's supporters accusing him of betrayal. bennett, an observant jew, noted that the ancient jewish people twice lost their homeland in biblical times due to bitter infighting. ""this time, at the decisive moment, we have taken responsibility,"" he said.  ""to continue on in this way more elections, more hatred, more vitriolic posts on facebook is just not an option.  therefore we stopped the train, a moment before it barrelled into the abyss. ""bennett, a millionaire former high-tech entrepreneur, faces a tough test maintaining an unwieldy coalition of parties from the political right, left and centre. the coalition, including a small islamist faction that is making history as the first arab party to sit in a coalition, agree on little beyond their opposition to netanyahu.  they are likely to pursue a modest agenda that seeks to reduce tensions with the palestinians and maintain good relations with the us without launching any major initiatives. ""we will forge forward on that which we agree and there is much we agree on, transport, education and so on, and what separates us we will leave to the side,"" bennett said.  he also promised a ""new page"" in relations with israel's arab sector. israel's arab citizens make up about 20 per cent of the population, but have suffered from discrimination, poverty and lack of opportunities.  netanyahu has often tried portray arab politicians as terrorist sympathisers, though he also courted the same arab party in a failed effort to remain in power after mar 23 elections. bennett, who like netanyahu opposes the establishment of a palestinian state, made little mention of the palestinians beyond threatening a tough response to violence.  he also vowed, like netanyahu, to oppose us-led efforts to restore the international nuclear accord with iran. ""israel will not allow iran to arm itself with nuclear weapons,"" he said.  ""israel is not party to the agreement and will maintain full freedom to act. ""but he also thanked biden for his support of israel.  he promised to take a different approach than netanyahu, who has alienated much of the democratic party through his antagonistic relationship with then-president barack obama and close ties with former president donald trump. ""my government will make an effort to deepen and nurture relations with our friends in both parties bipartisan,"" bennett said.  ""if there are disputes, we will manage them with fundamental trust and mutual respect. ""while bennett's speech was conciliatory, netanyahu's was confrontational.  he began by boasting of his achievements, including diplomatic treaties with four arab states and a successful coronavirus vaccination drive, before belittling the man who is replacing him. he accused bennett of abandoning israel's right-wing electorate and joining weak ""leftists"" to become prime minister.  he said bennett did not have the backbone to stand up to iran or pressure from the us to make concessions to the palestinians. ""i will lead you in the daily struggle against this evil and dangerous leftist government in order to topple it,"" he said.  ""god willing, it will happen a lot faster than what you think. ""in the opposition, netanyahu remains head of the largest party in parliament.  the new coalition is a patchwork of small and midsize parties that could collapse if any of its members decide to bolt.  bennett's party, for instance, holds just six seats in the 120-seat parliament. yohanan plesner, president of the israel democracy institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said the new government will likely be more stable than it appears. each party in the coalition will want to prove that it can deliver.  for that, they need ""time and achievements,"" he said.  still, netanyahu ""will continue to cast a shadow"", plesner said. the driving force behind the coalition is yair lapid, a political centrist who will become prime minister in two years in a rotation agreement with bennett, if the government lasts that long. lapid called off a planned speech, saying he was ashamed that his 86-year-old mother had to witness the raucous behavior of his opponents. ""i wanted her to be proud of the democratic process in israel.  instead she, along with every citizen of israel, is ashamed of you and remembers clearly why it's time to replace you,"" he said. netanyahu's place in israeli history is secure, having served as prime minister for a total of 15 years more than any other, including the country's founding father, david ben-gurion. but his reputation as a political magician has faded particularly since he was indicted in 2019 for fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes. he refused calls to step down, instead lashing out at the media, judiciary and law enforcement, going so far as to accuse his political opponents of orchestrating an attempted coup.  last year, protesters began holding weekly rallies across the country calling on him to resign. netanyahu remains popular among the hard-line nationalists who dominate israeli politics, but he could soon face a leadership challenge from within his own party.  a less polarising likud leader would stand a good chance of assembling the right-wing coalition that netanyahu had hoped to form. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-14,Singapore reports four cases of heart inflammation after second jab of mRNA Covid-19 vaccines.,"

singapore, june 12 (bernama): singapore has reported four cases of heart inflamation involving young men aged between 18 to 30 years after taking the second dose of mrna covid-19 vaccines. the republic's expert committee on covid-19 vaccination in a statement issue late friday said most cases of ""myocarditis and pericarditis"" were reported to have occurred within a few days after receiving the second dose of the vaccine. ""however.  all have recovered or have been discharged well from hospital,"" it said. myocarditis and pericarditis are inflammatory conditions affecting the heart muscles and the outer lining of the heart respectively. however, the committee said that while further studies and investigations were on-going, the currently available data suggests that there might be a ""very small risk"" of myocarditis and pericarditis after the second dose of an mrna vaccine, particularly in young men. ""they occur more often in men compared to women.  patients with the condition show symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath or abnormal heartbeats. ""most cases are mild, recover without the need for significant intervention and do not suffer any long-term effects, although very rarely, severe cases may result in damage to the heart muscles,"" it explained. as a precaution, the committee recommended that vaccinated persons, in particular adolescents and younger men, should avoid strenuous physical activity for one week after their second dose. the committee noted that it has been closely monitoring international reports on the situation and reviewed the currently available international and local data. ""our assessment is that the benefits of receiving the mrna covid-19 vaccines, such as reduction in covid-19 infections and severe complications even if infected, continue to outweigh the risks of vaccination,"" it said. it added that increased occurrences of myocarditis and pericarditis after the second dose of mrna covid-19 vaccinations have been observed overseas including in the united states (us), in adolescents and young men below the age of 25 years. ""the risk of this has been estimated to be 1. 6 cases per 100, 000 doses for mrna vaccines in the us, which is comparable to the risk of anaphylaxis observed in singapore. ""to date, there is no observed incremental risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after the first dose of vaccine,"" it said.  bernama

2021-06-14,Commentary: Southeast Asian countries should not be rattled by China despite economic realities.,"an incursion by chinese aircraft into malaysian airspace is yet another reminder of beijing's belligerence, says this observernew south wales: earlier this month, 16 chinese military transport aircraft weresighted a little more than 100kmoff the coast of the east malaysian state of sarawak. the royal malaysian air force called it ""a serious threat to national sovereignty"". the ministry of foreign affairs summoned china's ambassador to malaysia to voice its displeasure over the incursion into malaysian airspace.  however, china's foreign ministry spokesperson dismissed malaysian concerns by claiming that the aircraft were there for ""routine flight exercises"". malaysia is not alone in being wary of chinese intentions in the region.  china's infamous ""nine-dash line"" around the south china sea and unilateral claims to as much as 80 per cent of the disputed waters, along with the construction of artificial islands, has caused much consternation. regular incursions by chinese fishing trawlers have occurred in indonesian, vietnamese and filipino waters, and the belligerence displayed by chinese naval vessels and aircraft has further fuelled suspicions. southeast asian leaders must balance economic realities with defending territorial sovereignty and national pride. the incursion by chinese aircraft into malaysian airspace comes barely two months after a controversial remark by the malaysian foreign affairs minister hishammuddin hussein during a visit to fujian province in southern china on apr 1. hishammuddin told his chinese counterpart wang yi that ""you will always be my elder brother"".  prominent malaysian opposition leader anwar ibrahim lamented that ""this is not the language and style that should be used in the diplomatic world and international relations, as it seemingly implies malaysia is a puppet to a foreign power"". anwar urged hishammuddin to retract his comment and apologise to malaysians.  hishammuddin later clarified that his remark was meant to show his respect to wang, who is an older person and a very senior diplomat. china as a superpowerhishammudin should have been more cautious with his language.  his remarks offer a further warning of the potential cost to southeast asian leaders of being seen to defer to china's sphere of influence. beijing has calculated that as china gained stature as a superpower southeast asian nations would not, and could not, challenge its economic and military might.  this was underscored after president xi jinping announced in 2015 that china had no intention of militarising the south china sea, only to then proceeded to build more artificial islands and install missiles and erect buildings and military bases on those islands. the risk for hishammudin was to again reinforce this lesson. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid. southeast asian countries, including malaysia, recognise that none of them has the capability to match china's military might.  and the region does indeed have deep ties with china economically, which beijing is eager to grow. construction of a high-speed railway service linking kunming in yunnan province with singapore as part of the belt and road initiative (bri) remains a top priority for china.  however, southeast asian leaders must balance economic realities with defending territorial sovereignty and national pride. china has been actively cultivating malaysia through the funding and construction of massive infrastructure projects.  in 2016, the east coast rail link (ecrl) costing 65. 5 billion ringgit (us$15. 8 billion) was launched to link kuantan on the eastern coast with ports in the western coast. the melaka gateway, a us$10. 5 billion commercial and property development project, was awarded to a malaysian company that included three chinese commercial partners.  three pipelines were also awarded to chinese companies at a cost of us$4. 1 billion. tight economic tiesmalaysia was right to be disappointed at china's action to send military planes close to its borders. yet after the ruling barisan nasional was voted out of office in 2018, the incoming prime minister mahathir mohamed proceeded to review these projects.  in a visit to beijing in august 2018, he warned about the ""new version of colonialism"" where rich countries preyed on poorer ones in what was taken to be a swipe to china. the three planned pipelines were scrapped a month later.  mahathir renegotiated terms for the ecrl and reduced the cost to 44 billion ringgit in 2019. with the collapse of the mahathir government in february 2020, prime minister muhyiddin yassin proceeded to mend ties with china.  in april this year, it was announced that the renegotiated ecrl would cost 50 billion ringgit. however, the malacca state government cancelled the melaka gateway project in november 2020 on the basis that there had been ""no development"". malaysia's experience in an example of how china influence is conditioning behaviour in southeast asia.  in 2019, nikkei asia reported that the 10-member association of southeast asian nations had overtaken the united states as the second-largest trading partner for china. chinese investments also flow into southeast asia, largely through the bri, the global times reporting in november 2020 that china's investment in southeast asia was more than 76 per cent of the total investment in countries and regions linked with the bri. but none of this should be cause for southeast asian leaders to surrender sovereign interests to a bully in beijing.  malaysia was right to be disappointed at china's action to send military planes close to its borders. malaysia should take a lesson of its own, that china has a ""new version of colonialism"".  responding collectively as a region should be the priority. jason lim is senior lecturer in asian

2021-06-14,IN FOCUS: How Johor’s residential property market has been hit hard by COVID-19.,"the johor skyline is now dotted with empty condominium units, due to an oversupply in the market and lack of foreign buyers. johor bahru: when singapore business owner jonathan gan purchased a four-room condominium at lovell country garden in 2018, he thought he had clinched his dream retirement home. the freehold apartment located near johor bahru's city centre was twice the size of his three-room hdb flat in singapore, but the cost was only half of the latter when he bought it directly from the developers. ""the best thing about the unit is the amazing view.  you never get anything close to it at such value in singapore,"" added the 42-year-old, who lives with his wife and two daughters. the apartment, like most units in the lovell development, overlooks the straits of johor.  the balcony opens up to a picturesque sea view and there is a sandy beach below. ""it was the ideal weekend home,"" said gan.  ""but now it's becoming a bugbear. ""just three years after he purchased it, gan, who bought the unit at around rm1 million (us$242,000), is having a hard time trying to sell it, even though the asking price is a fraction of what he paid for it. since the covid-19 pandemic hit last year, border closures between singapore and malaysia meant that he and his family could not visit his weekend home. furthermore, gan's business in singapore has been affected by the pandemic, and he now needs to sell the apartment to gain some liquidity. ""all this was never part of the plan.  but the house is just left there, collecting dust and its value is going down by the day.  we felt it is better to cut our losses and try to get rid of it,"" he told cna. despite being on the market for over a year, there have been no takers.  he has engaged agents and even advertised the unit on various property portals but to no avail. ""there is not much hope.  barely anyone has viewed or signalled interest,"" he said. gan is among property owners in johor bahru who are having issues trying to sell their properties, as the market is in the doldrums due to the prolonged effects of covid-19. condominium developments around johor bahru were built with foreign buyers in mind, but the pandemic has closed borders, leaving many of them empty.  units owned by those from china, singapore, hong kong have been left unoccupiedwhile homes that were left unsold have stayed empty.  landed property is also facing potential depreciation. johor's oversupply problemaccording to statistics compiled by property consultancy firm henry butcher, the value and volume of residential property transactions in johor had been climbing ""rather steadily"" from 2017 until 2019. in its report on the outlook of the malaysian property market in 2021, the firm noted that the volume of transactions rose 8 per cent in 2018 and 7. 5 per cent in 2019, while the value of the transactions increased by 1. 5 per cent in 2018 and 15. 9 per cent in 2019. the report highlighted that the movement control order (mco) imposed by the malaysian government from mar 18, 2020, was a key reason that reversed the upward trend. it said that in the first nine months of 2020, the volume and value of transactions declined by almost a quarter compared to the same period in 2019. property analyst debbie choy, who is director of knight frank malaysia's johor branch, said the situation is particularly bad for condominiums and serviced apartments, of which there is an oversupply in the iskandar region. ""many developments were targeting a large proportion of overseas buyers.  with the prolonged effects of covid-19 restricting movements, it has been challenging for developers or investors to offload either for sale or rent,"" said choy. the situation is exacerbated by the fact that foreigners are presently not allowed to purchase homes in malaysia under the malaysia my second home program (mm2h) scheme, which has been temporarily suspended since july 2020. mm2h was suspended by the ministry of tourism, arts and culture (motac) in line with the government's decision to bar foreigners from entering enter malaysia following the outbreak of covid-19. motac added that the government is currently reviewing the mm2h programme, and that foreigners still interested to participate must abide by the latest requirements when it is reinstated. mm2h president anthony liew was quoted by local media last sunday (jun 6) saying that the suspension has curtailed interest from singapore and china buyers in johor property. ""the three big chinese developers, country garden pacificview, r&f development and greenland group, have seen the demand for their developments in johor from chinese buyers drop,"" loke reportedly said. even owners of the more premium, newer developments in johor bahru are having problems trying to attract tenants. a taiwanese woman, who wanted to be known only as k, told cna that she has put up her 3-room condominium unit at the astaka for rent, after she headed back home when the pandemic hit. the astaka, a premium condominium located at bukit senyum in the heart of johor bahru, saw 70 per cent of its units snapped up by buyers when it was first launched in 2019. the two towers, standing at 65 and 70 storeys, have three- or four-room units of between 2,207 and 2,659 sq ft. however, after the pandemic hit, demand has dried up and owners who are not in johor are not able to find interested tenants. k told cna that she had purchased the unit in 2019, with the idea of renting it out for investment returns.  however, after almost two years, no tenant has made a ""suitable offer"". she first listed her 3-room unit at rm5,700 a month.  fifteen months later, she has lowered the rental price to rm3,800 and there has not been a single offer from potential tenants.  she purchased the unit for around rm2 million. ""i think considering the circumstances, i have no choice but to lower the rental price.  i notice that there have been no offers.  i am patient.  hopefully, when the pandemic is over, there will be people who are interested,"" said k. the demand from johoreans has also weakened, as they reel from the effects of the pandemic. khor yu leng, a political economist with consultancy firm segi enam advisors, said that besides border closures restricting foreign buyers or tenants, locals are also grappling with the economic impact of covid-19 and their disposable income has been restricted. she noted that locals with more spending power were typically johoreans who commuted daily to singapore for work.  however, with borders closed from daily commuting, this group is either out of work or is now based in singapore. ""the spending power of the former johor daily commuters and singapore residents who visited johor weekly or otherwise has diminished or disappeared from the johor economy,"" said khor. she noted that the impact on the johor economy meant that some johoreans have turned to the state government for financial assistance,and buying luxury condominium property is not realistic. ""a year later, with johor's economic umbilical still cut off from singapore, and malaysia suffering a big wave of covid-19, informal social support activities (to help the lower-income households) have been ongoing,"" added khor. even with the overall value and volume of transactions increasing prior to covid-19, khor noted there were signs that some condominium developments were struggling to sell their excess units. in its report, henry butcher malaysia highlighted that johor was the state with the highest proportion of unsold residential properties in the country, even before covid-19. the report said that johor contributes 19. 5 per cent of ""overhang"" residential properties and a whopping 73. 7 per cent of all overhang condominium apartments in the country in 2019. ""of these, approximately 34 per cent of the overhang service apartments/sohos are priced over rm1 million which were believed to have been designed specifically for foreign investors from singapore and china,"" the report said. landed homes also affectedbesides condominiums and serviced apartments, those with landed properties in the southern state are also concerned about depreciating values. a singaporean who wanted to be known only as mustaqim, who owns a two-storey 4,000 sq ft terrace home at gated community horizon hills, has expressed concern that the value of his house is depreciating since he purchased it in july 2017. horizon hills is popular among foreign buyers, especially singaporeans, as it is a mere 15-minute drive to tuas second link.  the development is also close to amenities such as the sunway iskandar township, which has hospitals, malls as well as prestigious international schools. mustaqim bought the house as a retirement home rather than an investment, but admitted he was worried that based onrecent price trendsin the area, his home has lost some of its value. he bought his home a decade after the development was launched in 2017, for around rm1. 8 million. ""with covid-19, some of my neighbours who are singaporeans have decided to sell their homes for rm1. 1 million to rm1. 2 million.  it is spoiling the market a bit but i can understand why with the borders closed,"" said mustaqim. ""i am concerned that this downward trend will continue and my home's value will be going lower and lower.  i would be owning a depreciating asset,"" he added. however, mustaqim, who is currently in singapore due to the borders being closed, is determined to wait out the pandemic. ""the value will rise again post-pandemic,"" said mustaqim. property agents in johor have also seen their livelihoods hit with the lower volume and value of transactions during covid-19. an agent who wanted to be quoted only as brian, told cna that he has been forced to take a second mortgage on his own home as the number of transactions has dried up since the pandemic. ""some months i barely make any transactions, so i've been looking around for another job to tide through over the next few months,"" he said. the agent, who specialises in selling condominiums in the central johor bahru area, said that most developments have the same problem – too many units on sale with ""almost zero"" demand. ""some months, we have to live with zero completed transactions.  so, the situation is really bad for us,"" added brian. the tightening of restrictions during the ongoing nationwide mco 3. 0 meant that agents are not able to legally arrange physical viewings of homes for any interested buyers or tenants.  with virtual viewings being the only permissible option, it becomes even harder to make a sale. cna has approached the johor chief minister's office, as well as the state housing and local government committee for comments on the state of the property market and whether measures will be taken to assist industry players. empty homes susceptible to crimeanother headache for owners whose properties have been left empty is their susceptibility to break-ins. economist khor said that properties that are not located within gated communities may be more vulnerable. investors with properties in johor but cannot be physically there are now confronting the practical problems of how to guard, maintain and have a house-sitter, she said. ""the reality of the prolonged border closure will surely crimp some future demand,"" she added. in september last year, it was reported that police had arrested two men for breaking into houses at taman bukit indah, a suburb where foreigners have been known to invest in property. johor police added that the pair had specifically targeted vacant homes whose owners were in singapore due to the border restrictions. rahmah zainolabidin, a singaporean who chose to remain in johor bahru during this pandemic, told cna that she has been taking care of homes belonging to her family members who have chosen to return to the city-state. she told cna how her sister's home, a terrace house located in a non-gated community in taman bukit indah, had been robbed in august 2020. ""when i was walking towards the home from afar, i could see that something was wrong.  the windows were pried open wide and the gate was ajar,"" said the 65-year-old. ""they broke the gate grilles and drilled into the safe, taking thousands of dollars in cash as well as jewellery,"" she added. rahmah said that her sister was considering selling the house, but she had to first set aside money to repair the damage inflicted. ""it is sad because she already got robbed, but now she has to fork out more money to try to sell it off.  and in this market, i'm convinced there will be little interest, especially with the number of robberies reported in the area,"" rahmah added. ""crime is a serious issue . . .  i don't think people would consider buying homes in areas with high incidences of break-ins. ""charmaine tay, a freelance agent who focuses on property deals in johor bahru and the medini iskandar malaysia area, told cna that houses located in areas with a high incidence of break-ins have seen a drop in value and demand. ""many buyers are aware that landed homes are susceptible to break-ins in johor, so they tend to look for those located within gated areas where there are security checks,"" said tay. ""but for those houses outside gated communities, especially in areas like taman bukit indah where robbery is common, they are harder to sell, and the value has depreciated faster recently,"" she addedbuyers from other states, overseas bargain hunters could spark recoverythose interviewed by cna said that there are two groups of buyers who could help pave the way towards recovery in the residential property sector. the first group is potential buyers from other states. choy of knight frank predicted that domestic tourism will likely recover first.  she noted how in the second half of 2020, the property market saw a slight rebound when movement restrictions were lifted domestically before another wave of infections hit in september. choy said that many malaysians who have been stuck in kuala lumpur would then take some ""leisure time off"" and possibly buy or rent properties in the smaller cities. however, she warned that the high-rise residential sector in johor would only see gradual and slow progress as the units, which are in abundant oversupply, are not priced right for locals. ""developers have since then restructured and re-looked at planning to target more local purchasers i. e.  by reducing unit sizing and thus, the end pricing – this makes the prices more palatable for the local community,"" said choy. the return of foreign buyers may also provide some relief. choy highlighted the reopening of borders will provide ""a more optimistic outlook with more certainty and flexibility on travel arrangements"", especially with the currently low prices. she noted that even as there will be bargain hunters from overseas, foreign buyers should note the johor land administration has stated that there is a minimum threshold of rm1 million on residential homes for non-malaysian citizens. with borders remaining shut in the short term, the situation seems especially bleak for those desperate to sell their homes like gan, who cannot find a buyer despite lowering his asking price for his four-room apartment at lovell country garden. ""it's a sticky situation.  although we had good times using it as a weekend home, ultimately buying it was a wrong decision we now regret,"" he said. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

in abundant oversupply, are not priced right for locals.', '""developers have since then restructured and re-looked at planning to target more local purchasers i. e.  by reducing unit sizing and thus,

2021-06-14,Pandemic Turbocharges Aging Theme for Global Stock Investors.,"photographer: jason alden/bloombergthe world's emergence from the coronavirus pandemic is set to unleash a wave of spending by older consumers, with increasing opportunities for investors in aging-linked stocks. that's the view of money managers who see huge pent-up demand from wealthy seniors for medical services and luxury goods.  they also expect that the forced adoption of the internet by older people during lockdown will open up this demographic permanently to e-commerce companies and social networks. the number of people aged 65 and over is projected to double to more than 1. 5 billion by 2050, greatly increasing their economic impact.  the total spending power of the older population globally was about $8. 4 trillion in 2020, according to world data lab.  that's expected to grow to $14 trillion over the next decade. ""the pandemic has accelerated many of the issues related to aging populations and has highlighted the urgency of resolving them,"" said christopher rossbach, chief investment officer at j.  stern & co.  ""we think they will be significant drivers for growth and investment. ""u. s. , china are dominant markets for seniors' consumption 
source: world data labnote:  data is for middle and upper classes in 2011 purchasing power parityunderpinning the thesis are global fertility rates that are forecast to keep falling as life expectancy rises, even as the virus takes a staggering human toll.  china's decision last month to allow three-child families may have only limited impact on the aging trend in the most populous country. here are some key focuses of investors who argue that the aging theme will be even more important as economies move past the pandemic. from cancer screening to hip replacements and cataract surgery, countless medical procedures have been postponed since the virus took hold.  as this changes, global health-care spending is projected to bounce back in 2021, rising 5. 8% to $8. 8 trillion, according to ihs markit. rossbach expects shares of medical device manufacturers to benefit and cited thermo fisher scientific inc. , medtronic plc, becton dickinson & co.  and alcon inc. shares of all four companies have underperformed the global stock benchmark so far this year, with u. s. -listed becton dickinson down 3% versus the msci ac world index's 11% gain. mirabaud asset management ltd.  also likes medtronic, as well as edwards lifesciences corp.  for exposure to the cardiovascular diseases sector, said global equities head anu narula. hearing aids are another market hurt by fewer in-person consultations, with morgan stanley estimating sales will normalize this year, following a 15% decline in the market in 2020.  among businesses in this field, it has an overweight recommendation on copenhagen-listed gn store nord a/s and equal-weight on demant a/s, which have both surged this year. ""the large contingent of developed countries that have universal health coverage is being joined by an increasing number of developing markets that are establishing and/or expanding universal health-care systems, especially in emerging asian markets,"" said mirabaud's narula. as well as long-delayed holidays, the travel sector is poised to pick up with support from cashed-up seniors.  ""older or richer people tend to want to visit relatives more,"" said sanjiv bhatia, founder of pembroke emerging markets. read more: european luxury sizzles with nasdaq-beating multiples rossbach also has his eye on a rebound in luxury spending, with lvmh and liquor makers pernod ricard sa and diageo plc among his preferred reopening bets. ""a general point is that as people age their purchasing power increases and they become more concerned with quality, not quantity, of their consumption,"" he said. insurers stand to benefit too, as a surge in unplanned early retirements since the emergence of covid-19 raises awareness of unforeseen health and employment risks. strategists at credit suisse group ag expect growth potential for insurers, particularly in markets with relatively low penetration such as china. juliana hansveden, a fund manager at nordea asset management, sees insurance, medical and the internet all coming together to create investment opportunities. she is expressing confidence in the theme with a bet on loss-making ping an healthcare & technology co. , which is helping patients in china avoid long waiting time at hospitals by providing online medical consultations.  it is also working with parent company ping an insurance group co.  to bundle its health-care offering with insurance policies, she said. read more: 'new normal' on the internet for older adultsj.  stern's rossbach expects growth across the board for companies that can tap seniors and their new-found confidence online.

""this morning, we have spoken to christian eriksen, who has sent his greetings to his team-mates.  his condition is stable, and he continues to be hospitalised for further examination,"" it tweeted. the 29-year-old player suffered a cardiac arrest, the team doctor confirmed, but the reason remained unclear. ""he was gone; we did cardiac resuscitation, it was a cardiac arrest.  we got him back after one defib (defibrillation),"" dr morten boesen told a news conference, adding that eriksen remained in hospital for further tests. ""the exams that have been done so far look fine.  we don't have an explanation to why it happened. ""the dbu also said that the team and staff had ""received crisis assistance and will continue to be there for each other after yesterday's incident"". the news will have come as relief to eriksen's current and former teammates, many of whom wished him well. the inter milan midfielder collapsed in the 43rd minute of denmark's euro 2020 opener, laying motionless on the pitch as medical personnel performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr). captain simon kjaer reportedly helped to clear eriksen's airways first and started cpr before medics took over.  goalkeeper kasper schmeichel was seen consoling eriksen's wife sabrina kvist.  both players earned widespread praise as heroes. the game was suspended temporarily but after receiving confirmation that eriksen was all right and in a stable condition and awake, uefa gave the danes an option to resume the game shortly or restart yesterday at noon local time. 1.  fabrice muambathe bolton man collapsed during an fa cup match in 2012 due to a cardiac arrest and was technically ""dead"" for 78 minutes before he was revived.  the former england under-21 midfielder had to retire soon after at the age of 24. 2.  antonio puertathe sevilla midfielder collapsed during a spanish la liga match in 2007 and again in the dressing room.  he was rushed to hospital, where he died three days later of multiple organ failure due to cardiac arrest at the age of 22. 3.  marc-vivien foethe cameroon midfielder, 28, died during a confederations cup match in 2003.  medical staff failed to restart his heart on the pitch and he was pronounced dead. reutersthe former tottenham star was said to have told his teammates to return to the field and denmark coach kasper hjulmand also insisted there was no pressure from uefa, but some felt the game should have been called off and rescheduled to a later date. manchester united great peter, the danish custodian's father, told the bbc: ""it's a ridiculous decision by uefa.  they should have tried to work out a different scenario and shown a little bit of compassion, and they didn't. ""when the game resumed, the atmosphere at parken stadium was considerably muted and the hosts appeared to be distracted, slipping to a 1-0 defeat courtesy of joel pohjanpalo's second-half winner. the header was one that kasper would normally have saved as it was straight at him, while kjaer had to be taken off in the 63rd minutes as the defender was too ""overwhelmed"" to continue. denmark's yussuf poulsen won a penalty when he went down under slight contact in the 73rd minute.  in the absence of usual spot-kick taker eriksen, pierre-emile hojbjerg assumed the responsibility but the midfielder could only hit his penalty straight at finland goalkeeper lukas hradecky and hjulmand later admitted that his players were ""traumatised"". in the aftermath of the shocking event, conspiracy theories sprung up on the internet, suggesting that eriksen had previously contracted covid-19 and had been vaccinated. but inter director giuseppe marotta dismissed those claims, saying there was no truth behind them, while eriksen's former cardiologist, dr sanjay sharma of st george's, university of london, added he had no heart issues during his seven-season spell at spurs. the dbu yesterday called off a scheduled press conference while the team's next training session was postponed indefinitely, local broadcaster tv2 reported. agence france-presse, reutersjoin st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-14,Will Bennett outdo his former mentor Netanyahu?.,"the outgoing israeli prime minister and his supporters are already trying to undermine the new coalition government.  will it survive?the netanyahu family is experienced in moving its belongings out of the official prime minister's residence on jerusalem's balfour street.  in 2016, prime minister benjamin netanyahu told a group of stunned settlers being evicted from their homes in the illegal west bank outpost of amona, ""i understand what it means to lose a home.  after the 1999 elections, with zero warning, me and my family were simply kicked out of the house on balfour street.  just like that, with all of our belongings, we were just thrown into the street.  we had to go to the sheraton plaza hotel, it felt terrible. ""the likud party won 19 knesset seats in the 1999 elections, seven fewer than the labor party, led by ehud barak.  barak's government, just like the one sworn in on june 13, was a diverse coalition of parties, with meretz on the left, the hamerkaz party in the centre and the ultra-orthodox parties on the right.  the partnership lasted less than two years. what can that short-lived government teach us about the future of israel's new government led by yamina party leader naftali bennett and yesh atid party head yair lapid? what are the prospects of their diverse coalition comprising parties from the conservative jewish right, whose leaders are committed to the settlement enterprise, and lawmakers from the meretz party that boycotts goods made in the settlements? can the fierce women's rights campaigner merav michaeli, chair of the labor party, get along with conservative interior minister ayelet shaked who has pledged to deport asylum seekers and their families?the cards that prime minister naftali bennett is holding are far worse than those barak was dealt in 1999.  first of all, there has never been an israeli prime minister, nor a leader of any democracy, whose party only won 6 percent of the vote (translated into seven seats in the 120-member knesset, one of whom is opposed to the new government).  bennett is a default option, the best of three highly imperfect alternatives, the other two being the continued rule of benjamin netanyahu after 12 years in power, or a fifth round of elections widely expected to perpetuate the political deadlock.  the new government, both its makeup and guidelines, is thus hardly the ideal choice of its left-wing or right-wing components. bennett, as well as yisrael beitenu party leader avigdor lieberman and new hope party chair gideon saar, would have felt more comfortable in the company of their former likud party colleagues than seated alongside representatives of labor, meretz and the palestinian ra'am (united arab list) parties.  the common denominator of the new government is its disgust with netanyahu's personality and with his indictment on corruption charges. the centre-right partners of the new government are in tune with his ideology and with his foreign and defence policies.  presumably, if netanyahu cedes his leadership of the likud, or if his party colleagues muster the courage to unseat him, many in the new government would negotiate a partnership with the likud. however, netanyahu declared war on his successor even before he started packing and moving to the opposition benches.  netanyahu of 2021 is not the same young prime minister defeated 22 years ago who took time off from politics.  this time, he enjoys the backing of hot-headed legions of supporters and an army of violent bots. in the government's final days, with the ground burning under their feet, leaders of the ultra-orthodox parties and their rabbis joined the chorus of incitement against bennett.  the language they adopted, and their threats of hell were reminiscent of the atmosphere that prevailed in the months prior to the november 1995 assassination of prime minister yitzhak rabin. one of the new government's first challenges will be to douse these flames, restore trust in the country's legal system, police and the media, and try to instil respect for pluralism. the architects of the strange bennett-lapid coalition were well aware that the opposition would identify cracks in its edifice and plant explosives to blow it up.  these explosives include legislation on highly sensitive issues, such as the relationship between religion and state, the annexation of palestinian territories, lgbtq rights and the recognition of the progressive streams of judaism challenging the monopoly of the ultra-orthodox establishment. to defuse these time bombs, the coalition agreement perpetuates the status quo on each of these issues.  however, netanyahu has a new type of tnt at his disposal in the shape of arch-nationalist knesset member itamar ben-gvir and his arab-hating coterie.  ben-gvir was elected to the knesset this year with netanyahu's support, and is exploiting his parliamentary immunity to violate the status quo at the most volatile venues – jerusalem's muslim holy sites.  netanyahu can rely on hamas and islamic jihad to respond to ben-gvir's provocations. and what would bennett do if rockets from gaza are fired at jerusalem in response to a visit by jewish knesset members to the al-aqsa mosque/temple mount compound, sacred to both jews and muslims? would the two arab members of the new government, islamist ra'am chair mansour abbas and regional cooperation minister issawi frej of meretz vote in favour of retaliation against gaza and the killing of palestinian civilians? and would lieberman and saar vote for restraint if israelis are killed in a hamas attack?and would the staunchly pro-settlement bennett, respect a court ruling to demolish the 40 homes in the illegal west bank outpost of evyatar? how would he manoeuvre between pressure from the american administration to pursue diplomatic negotiations with the palestinians on the two-state solution, his centre-left partners who support the establishment of a palestinian state and his own strong statements against it, let alone the resentment of his partners from the right-wing parties?the negotiations on a new nuclear deal with iran are yet another obstacle facing the new government, which will force it to adopt an extremely difficult decision.  if he adheres to netanyahu's militant policy opposing the agreement, bennett will place himself on a collision course with the biden administration which will be in power throughout his two-year term.  on the other hand, if the government agrees to go along with the biden administration's policy, netanyahu is likely to launch a public campaign accusing the new government of ""abandoning the jewish people to a second holocaust"". throughout his long rule, netanyahu was considered a magician walking on tightropes without a safety net.  bennett saw his performance up close when he served as his chief of staff when he was opposition leader between 2006 and 2008.  to survive in power long enough to start fixing some of the damage netanyahu has inflicted on israeli society, bennett will have to surpass his former master. the views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect al jazeera's editorial stance. follow al jazeera

more comfortable in the company of their former likud party colleagues than seated alongside representatives of labor, meretz and the palestinian ra'am (united arab list) parties."", ""the common denominator of the new government is its disgust with netanyahu's personality and with his indictment on corruption charges."", 'the centre-right partners of the new government are in tune with his ideology and with his foreign and defence policies.', 'presumably, if netanyahu cedes his leadership of the likud, or if his party colleagues muster the courage to unseat him, many in the new government would negotiate a partnership with the likud.', 'however, netanyahu declared war on his successor even before he started packing and moving to the opposition benches.', 'netanyahu of 2021 is not the same young prime minister defeated 22 years ago who took time off from politics.', 'this time, he enjoys the backing of hot-headed legions of supporters and an army of violent bots.', ""in the government's final days, with the ground burning under their feet, leaders of the ultra-orthodox parties and their rabbis joined the chorus of incitement against bennett."", 'the language they adopted, and their threats of hell were reminiscent of the atmosphere that prevailed in the months prior to the november 1995 assassination of prime minister yitzhak rabin.', ""one of the new government's first challenges will be to douse these flames, restore trust in the country's legal system, police and the media, and try to instil respect for pluralism."", 'the architects of the strange bennett-lapid coalition were well aware that the opposition would identify cracks in its edifice and plant explosives to blow it up.', 'these explosives include legislation on highly sensitive issues, such as the relationship between religion and state, the annexation of palestinian territories, lgbtq rights and the recognition of the progressive streams of judaism challenging the monopoly of the ultra-orthodox establishment.', 'to defuse these time bombs, the coalition agreement perpetuates the status quo on each of these issues.', 'however, netanyahu has a new type of tnt at his disposal in the shape of arch-nationalist knesset member itamar ben-gvir and his arab-hating coterie.', ""ben-gvir was elected to the knesset this year with netanyahu's support, and is exploiting his parliamentary immunity to violate the status quo at the most volatile venues – jerusalem's muslim holy sites."", ""netanyahu can rely on hamas and islamic jihad to respond to ben-gvir's provocations."", 'and what would bennett do if rockets from gaza are fired at jerusalem in response to a visit by jewish knesset members to the al-aqsa mosque/temple mount compound, sacred to both jews and muslims?', ""would the two arab members of the new government, islamist ra'am chair mansour abbas and regional cooperation minister issawi frej of meretz vote in favour of retaliation against gaza and the killing of palestinian civilians?"", 'and would lieberman and saar vote for restraint if israelis are killed in a hamas attack?and would the staunchly pro-settlement bennett, respect a court ruling to demolish the 40 homes in the illegal west bank outpost of evyatar?', 'how would he manoeuvre between pressure from the american administration to pursue diplomatic negotiations with the palestinians on the two-state solution, his centre-left partners who support the establishment of a palestinian state and his own strong statements against it, let alone the resentment of his partners from the right-wing parties?the negotiations on a new nuclear deal with iran are yet another obstacle facing the new government, which will force it to adopt an extremely difficult decision.', ""if he adheres to netanyahu's militant policy opposing the agreement, bennett will place himself on a collision course with the biden administration which will be in power throughout his two-year term."", 'on the other hand, if the government agrees to go along with the biden administration\'s policy, netanyahu is likely to launch a public campaign accusing the new government of ""abandoning the jewish people to a second holocaust"".', 'throughout his long rule, netanyahu was considered a magician walking on tightropes without a safety net.', 'bennett saw his performance up close when he served as his chief of staff when he was opposition leader between 2006 and 2008.  to survive in power long enough to start fixing some of the damage netanyahu has inflicted on israeli society, bennett will have to surpass his former master.', ""the views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect al jazeera's editorial stance."", 'follow al

2021-06-14,"157 suspected serious reactions to vaccines out of 3.7m doses here, Singapore News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. there have been 157 reports here of suspected reactions to the covid-19 vaccines severe enough to be life-threatening or result in hospitalisation, among other serious conditions. however, no deaths have been linked to the jab, the health sciences authority (hsa) said last friday. these ""suspected serious adverse events"" made up 0. 004 per cent of the almost 3. 7 million doses of pfizer-biontech and moderna jabs administered till may 23. these serious cases form part of the 4,704 ""suspected adverse event reports"" that hsa received till may 23.  these translate into 0. 13 per cent of administered doses, which is consistent with the percentage that had been reported by the authority on may 6, when it last gave an update on the safety record of both mrna vaccines. these reactions are suspected to be associated with the vaccinations, but may not have been caused by them. an adverse event or reaction related to vaccination is any undesirable medical condition that occurs after taking the vaccine, which does not necessarily have a direct link to the treatment.  they may be coincidental or related to an undiagnosed disease, but have to be reported by healthcare providers to hsa. reactions are considered serious if they result in hospitalisation, disability or life-threatening illnesses, among other things. anaphylaxis, which is the rapid onset of severe allergic reactions, was the most frequently reported serious adverse event, with 26 such cases.  all of them recovered after medical treatment, hsa said. it added that the incidence rate of anaphylaxis reported here with the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines is about 0. 85 cases for every 100,000 doses administered.  ""this is similar to the incidence rates reported overseas of around 0. 5 to two per 100,000 doses administered,"" said hsa. other severe allergic reactions numbered 23.  these include breathing difficulty, fast heart rate, an increase or decrease in blood pressure, chest discomfort and pain, fainting, limb numbness and weakness or pain, changes in vision, increase in liver enzymes, joint pain, fits, ringing in the ears and infections. the authority said most of those who had developed serious adverse events have recovered or are recovering.  ""these serious adverse events are being closely monitored by hsa,"" it added. hsa said that the most commonly reported reactions are consistent with those typically observed following vaccination. from the 4,704 reactions, the most common one was cases of rash, which accounted for more than one in four reported adverse events.  this was followed by cases of swelling of eyelids, face or lips, which occurred in about one in seven cases. these are typically resolved within a few days and are in line with the events described in the vaccines' product information, as well as those reported overseas. most of the adverse events were associated with the pfizer-biontech vaccine, which was rolled out for use here on dec 30 last year and comprised 83 per cent of the doses administered.  moderna was deployed on march 12 this year.  about 68 per cent of the total number of reactions reported were among people below the age of 60. hsa pointed out that trials of the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines found that those younger than 60 tend to experience more adverse effects occurring soon after vaccination, compared with those who are older. generally, younger people have more active immune responses and may experience more adverse effects, said hsa.  it pointed out that this is part of the body's natural response to build immunity against covid-19 infection. the authority added that 64 per cent of these reactions were reported in females. its update also noted that a greater frequency of heart attacks and strokes has not been observed in vaccinated persons locally. this comes after it was announced last friday that six people were reported to have suffered heart inflammation after receiving covid-19 vaccines four of whom were men aged below 30. as a precaution, experts have advised that vaccinated people, especially adolescents and younger men, should avoid strenuous physical activity for one week after their second dose. ""it is important to note that heart attacks and strokes can occur naturally within our population, regardless of whether people are vaccinated or not,"" said hsa. ""due to the large numbers of people being vaccinated, it is expected that, by coincidence, some individuals may experience other medical events such as heart attacks and strokes in the days or weeks after vaccination which may not be related to the vaccination. ""hsa said it is monitoring the incidence of anaphylaxis and bell's palsy, which are adverse events historically reported with vaccines. there have been 45 reported cases of bell's palsy, which causes temporary weakness or paralysis of facial muscles.  most of the cases were not serious, hsa said, and patients will generally have complete recovery even without treatment. the incidence rate for this reaction in singapore is estimated to be 3. 35 per 100,000 persons per month.  hsa said that this is within the background incidence of 1. 1 to 4. 4 per 100,000 persons per month before the introduction of vaccination. the authority said that it, along with the ministry of health, will continue to monitor the safety of covid-19 vaccines closely and update the public on any significant safety concerns detected with the vaccines. overall, the benefits of the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines continue to outweigh the known risks of covid-19 disease and its severe complications in a pandemic, hsa added. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

posted at jun 14 2021 10:04 amsharetokyo tokyo olympic organizers plan to give away about 150,000 condoms at next month's games, but are telling athletes to take them home rather than use them in the olympic village where social distancing rules and coronavirus measures are the top priority. large numbers of condoms have been given out at the games since the 1988 seoul olympics to raise awareness of hiv and aids, and organizers said the international olympic committee had requested their continued distribution. but athletes have been told to keep their distance from each other, meaning fewer opportunities to mingle and more. ""the distribution of condoms is not for use at the athlete's village, but to have athletes take them back to their home countries to raise awareness"" of hiv and aids issues, said tokyo 2020 in an emailed response to questions by reuters. officials have already barred overseas spectators and are asking those who do attend the delayed event to show their support by clapping rather than cheering or singing to try and reduce the risk of spreading the virus. dining has become another issue to resolve. organizers were originally planning to feed residents of the village in vast dining halls – the largest one with a capacity to seat 4,500 people at once. but now, the organizers will ask athletes to dine alone, maintain social distancing with others, and wipe down surfaces after eating. ""without the proper measures in place, it will only take one person to bring in the virus and spread it, especially in places like the athlete village,"" nobuhiko okabe, one of the infectious disease specialists advising tokyo 2020 on its coronavirus measures said at a news conference on friday. ""we have to do what we can to make sure an outbreak doesn't happen, and we really need the cooperation of all the athletes and delegations to make this work,"" he added.

[you'll likely qualify!]england gets its tournament started on sunday. benjamin netanyahu, israel's longest serving prime minister, was ousted on sunday night by a cross-party coalition government, raising hopes that the worst political crisis in the country's history is drawing to a close.  at a special session in the knesset, the israeli parliament, lawmakers voted narrowly in favour of removing mr netanyahu from high office and swearing in a unity government.  the coalition will be led by naftali bennett, the right-wing leader of the yamina party, who will serve athe pine island glacier on the west antarctic ice sheet is responsible for more than a quarter of antarctica's contribution to global sea level rise over the past decades.  now, a new study shows it is more vulnerable to rapid melting than thought, because climate change is weakening its natural braking system. why it matters: at stake is the future of a glacier containing about 160 trillion tons of ice, which if it were all to melt into the ocean would cause about 1. 6 feet of global sea level risso mad that i just learned this. . . at a low point in u. s. -russian relations, president joe biden and russian president vladimir putin appear to agree broadly on at least one thing — their first face-to-face meeting wednesday is a chance to set the stage for a new era in arms control.   the fabric of arms control has been fraying, notably with the abandonment in 2019 — first by washington, then by moscow — of the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty, which had governed a whole class of missiles for more than three decades.   last month the biden administration informed the russians that it would not reenter the treaty, and last week putin confirmed russia's exit. biden's meeting with queen elizabeth ii is his first in nearly four decades. western democracies are in a race to compete with autocratic governments, u. s.  president joe biden said on sunday.

""unfortunately my words have not been interpreted correctly in a recent interview with la stampa,"" dr cavaleri said in a statement to reuters. the astrazeneca shot ""maintains a favourable benefit risk profile in all ages but particularly in the elderly above 60"", he said. the ema's position is that the astrazeneca shot is safe and can be used for all age groups over 18.  however several eu member states have stopped administering it to people below a certain age, usually ranging from 50 to 65, restricting its use to older people, due to very rare cases of blood clotting, mainly among young people. on sunday evening, la stampa changed the headline on its article online and added a clarification with dr cavaleri's later comments to its article.  la stampa editor massimo giannini said he had no further comment. earlier this week, the italian government said it would restrict the use of the astrazeneca vaccine to people aged over 60, after a teenager who had received the shot died from a rare form of blood clotting. italian health minister roberto speranza told reporters on sunday that italy will continue to use the astrazeneca vaccine on the over 60s, including on those who have not received a first shot. like many european countries, italy briefly halted astrazeneca inoculations in march over concerns about the very rare blood clotting problems.  it resumed them the following month with the recommendation that the product be ""preferably"" used for people over the age of 60, after the ema said its benefits outweighed any risks. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-14,G7 summit: What have the wealthy democracies agreed on?.,"in a joint communique, the g7 pledges to address vaccine inequity, climate change and global taxes. the leaders of the g7 countries ended a three-day summit with a diverse set of initiatives, including a pledge to vaccinate poorer countries against the coronavirus, a promise to make large corporations pay their fair share of taxes and a plan to tackle climate change with a blend of technology and money. in a joint communique delivered on sunday at the end of the meeting in the british southwestern city of cornwall, the leaders of the g7 countries – canada, france, germany, italy, japan, the united kingdom and the united states – sought to show that international cooperation is back after the upheavals caused by the pandemic and the unpredictability of former us president donald trump. here is a round-up of the g7's main initiatives:the g7 made ambitious promises, such as sharing vaccine doses with less well-off nations that urgently need them.  uk prime minister boris johnson, who held a press conference at the conclusion of the summit, said the group would pledge at least 1 billion doses, with half of that coming from the us and 100 million from britain. many of the promised doses will flow through covax, a global vaccine buying system backed by the world health organization and gavi, the vaccine alliance. the pledge does not represent entirely new resources, and the donation is far short of the number of shots needed to fully vaccinate poorer nations.  moreover, the plan does not address distribution gaps that could make it difficult to deliver doses. who chief tedros adhanom ghebreyesus and other public health officials commended the vaccine pledge but said it is not enough.  to truly end the pandemic, he said, 11 billion doses are needed to vaccinate at least 70 percent of the world's population by mid-2022. ""we need more and we need them faster,"" tedros said. the g7 also urged china to cooperate with the un health agency on a ""transparent"" second-phase probe into the origins of the global coronavirus pandemic. ""we . . .  call for a timely, transparent, expert-led, and science-based who-convened phase 2 covid-19 origins study including, as recommended by the experts' report, in china,"" the group said in their final statement. climate change was a key focus of the leaders' final day of talks with the g7 countries formally backing the ramp-up of collective action to tackle the environmental crisis. ""we commit to . . .  halving our collective emissions over the two decades to 2030, increasing and improving climate finance to 2025 and to conserve or protect at least 30 percent of our land and oceans by 2030,"" read the joint communique. the seven leaders also agreed to raise their contributions to meet an overdue spending pledge of $100bn a year to help poorer countries cut carbon emissions and cope with global warming, but campaigners said firm cash promises were missing. alongside plans billed as helping speed infrastructure funding in developing countries and a shift to renewable and sustainable technology, the world's seven largest advanced economies again pledged to meet the climate finance target. however, climate groups said such promises lacked detail.  a spokesman for british prime minister boris johnson said individual nations were expected to set out the size of the increases ""in due course"". max lawson, head of inequality policy at oxfam, said it was ""unacceptable that most of the g7 missed the opportunity to make new pledges of climate finance. """"developing countries were looking for progress on this front ahead of landmark climate talks in glasgow.  vague promises of new financing for green development projects should not distract from this goal,"" he said. the decision had been widely anticipated after finance ministers earlier this month embraced placing a global minimum tax of at least 15 percent on large multinational companies, in an attempt to stop corporations from using tax havens to avoid taxes and thus robbing some countries of much-needed revenue.  the proposal will now go to g20 nations meeting in italy next month. the wealthy nations demanded russia take action against those conducting cyberattacks and using ransomware, and called for an investigation into the use of chemical weapons on russian soil. ""we call on russia to urgently investigate and credibly explain the use of a chemical weapon on its soil, to end its systematic crackdown on independent civil society and media, and to identify, disrupt, and hold to account those within its borders who conduct ransomware attacks, abuse virtual currency to launder ransoms, and other cybercrimes,"" a communique issued after the conclusion of the leaders' summit in britain said. the g7 also called for an immediate end to hostilities in ethiopia's tigray region. ""we are deeply concerned by the ongoing conflict in ethiopia's tigray region and reports of an unfolding major humanitarian tragedy,"" said the communique.  ""we call for an immediate cessation of hostilities, unimpeded humanitarian access to all areas and the immediate withdrawal of eritrean forces. ""fighting broke out in the region in november between government troops and the region's former ruling party, the tigray people's liberation front (tplf).  troops from neighbouring eritrea also entered the conflict to support the ethiopian government. the leaders of the wealthy democracies say they will work together to challenge china's ""non-market economic practices"" and to call on beijing to respect human rights in xinjiang and hong kong. us president joe biden had wanted to persuade fellow democratic leaders to present a more unified front to compete economically with beijing and strongly call out china's ""nonmarket policies and human rights abuses"". the g7 communique said: ""with regard to china, and competition in the global economy, we will continue to consult on collective approaches to challenging non-market policies and practices which undermine the fair and transparent operation of the global economy. ""the leaders also said they will promote their values by calling on china to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms in xinjiang, where beijing is accused of committing serious human rights abuses against the uighur minority, and in the semi-autonomous city of hong kong. un chief warns virus could mutate and become resistant to the vaccines. protesters march to downing street and call on g7 leaders to end their support to israel following gaza assault. the 'build back better world' project is aimed squarely at competing with china's belt and road initiative. follow al jazeera

tackle climate change with a blend of technology and money.', 'in a joint communique delivered on sunday at the end of the meeting in the british southwestern city of cornwall, the leaders of the g7 countries – canada, france, germany, italy, japan, the united kingdom and the united states – sought to show that international cooperation is back after the upheavals caused by the pandemic and the unpredictability of former us president donald trump.', ""here is a round-up of the g7's main initiatives:the g7 made ambitious promises, such as sharing vaccine doses with less well-off nations that urgently need them."", 'uk prime minister boris johnson, who held a press conference at the conclusion of the summit, said the group would pledge at least 1 billion doses, with half of that coming from the us and 100 million from britain.', 'many of the promised doses will flow through covax, a global vaccine buying system backed by the world health organization and gavi, the vaccine alliance.', 'the pledge does not represent entirely new resources, and the donation is far short of the number of shots needed to fully vaccinate poorer nations.', 'moreover, the plan does not address distribution gaps that could make it difficult to deliver doses.', 'who chief tedros adhanom ghebreyesus and other public health officials commended the vaccine pledge but said it is not enough.',

sustainable technology, the world's seven largest advanced economies again pledged to meet the climate finance target."", 'however, climate groups said such promises lacked detail.', 'a spokesman for british prime minister boris johnson said individual nations were expected to set out the size of the increases ""in due course"".', 'max lawson, head of inequality policy at oxfam, said it was

2021-06-14,They grieved when their baby was born blind. Now they see a world of possibilities for him.,"eric and wei shi panicked at first: how could they raise elliot to be like everyone else? would he lag developmentally? could he ever be rich and successful? a year on, they're using his story to inspire others. singapore: there are nine photos of baby elliot displayed above the koh family's dining table.  they provide a window into a time when life was very different for his parents. in one, elliot is just out of hospital, a newborn being burped by his father.  in another, he is cuddled up to his mother, warmly dressed against the spray of jewel's indoor waterfall.  there is also one of his parents kissing him, their arms encircling him protectively. eric, 32, and wei shi, 31, put the photos up one evening last july when elliot was four months old.  they were looking forward to showing them to him as he grew older. they have never got to do so.  the very next day, they brought him to the doctor, suspecting a developmental delay.  a day later, they found out elliot was blind and was unlikely to ever have sight. eric remembers both of them bursting into tears on the spot.  ""my wife was still listening to the doctor intently to hear his explanation and diagnosis,"" he says.  ""i just walked out of the room and cried. ""nothing much needed to be said. ""the clinic was crowded, but his world went silent when he walked out of the doctor's office.  he called his mother, broke it to her and they cried on the phone together. he was still in shock as he tried to process how it had come to this. it started with a comment from wei shi's father, who had noticed elliot seemingly having trouble tracking things with his eyes. the couple did not think much of it then.  newborns often do not see very well yet, and their son would catch up, they rationalised. but the signs kept coming.  he showed no interest in the toys his grandmother placed in front of him.  he did not seem to smile or look at his surroundings. and when wei shi brought elliot on a play date, she noticed that her friend's baby of the same age was curious and excited, reaching out to grab toys, while elliot remained passive and did not lift his head. at that point, they decided to take him to a doctor, although they were still ""not too worried"".  but the paediatrician referred them to an ophthalmologist, who gave them the news that shook their world. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid. the couple did not exchange many words that day.  but questions kept running through their minds.  what could they do for elliot? what will happen to him when they are gone?wei shi could not help but wonder: had she done anything — maybe it was her diet or lifestyle — during her pregnancy or even during the delivery that could have resulted in this?but eric made it clear that neither of them was to blame. ""we can't solve the problem just by assigning blame,"" he says.  ""i was just focused on providing support for elliot and wei shi, just to be there and give them what they need. ""elliot, now 15 months old, was eventually diagnosed with leber congenital amaurosis, an inherited disease that causes vision loss. it affects about two to three newborns in every 100,000 births, according to the united states' national library of medicine and the american association for paediatric ophthalmology and strabismus. ""the doctors said it wasn't detectable on any scan because the retinas were just so tiny.  and it's not something that was avoidable,"" she added. once i knew that, i started to think that maybe i should focus on what i can control rather than the past, which is beyond my control. a new frienderic and wei shi wanted more answers to all the questions they had.  being young, modern parents, as they described themselves, they turned to google first. they searched for the abstract, like how the blind visualise things, as well as answers as to how they could interact with and take care of elliot. watch: raising a blind baby and the lessons we've learnt from it (12:02)they joined facebook groups for parents of children with the same disorder.  while these were international groups, it was encouraging to see that the other children were growing up well. the couple also picked up useful tips on caring for elliot, but the issue was a lack of local context.  they knew his condition was rare but had still hoped that help would be readily available for blind infants in singapore. for example, wei shi remembers looking for pre-schools or specialised therapies for visually impaired babies and children.  but she came away disappointed. ""it made me panic a little because i didn't know better,"" she says.  ""and if there's nothing on the internet, where can i find this information?""she recalls asking the doctors as much as possible about what to expect and so on.  but there were times the couple were also at a loss to know what to ask, she adds. help came from an unexpected source.  as eric sat in hospital waiting for elliot to undergo tests, he flicked his phone's screen and went on reddit, which he browsed regularly.  he had never made a post on the forum — but that day, he did. it was, simply: baby born blind.  need help. the replies he got surprised and touched him.  some pointed out local resources and organisations that support the blind; others said they had visually impaired friends and were happy to share their experiences. ""people were so willing to help,"" he says.  ""they gave us more than enough resources for us to get by. ""that was how they met cheryl yeo.  an orientation and mobility specialist from guide dogs singapore, the 29-year-old teaches people with visual impairment how to travel independently, and the skills they eventually need to use a guide dog. the kohs had tried ringing up several organisations but could not get through in the post-circuit breaker period, with people still working from home.  cheryl, whose calls were rerouted to her mobile, was the first person to call them back. the conversation lasted almost two hours.  the couple were anxious and, she recalls, sounded overwhelmed. ""one of the big questions eric asked was whether elliot would be able to get a girlfriend,"" she says.  ""it's rather funny, but it's actually quite a big concern because it's about how he's going to grow up, be like everyone else and find a job. ""she told them stories about her clients, like the schools they attended, their jobs and, in answer to eric's question, how some of them were looking for girlfriends.  ""it's just (about) showing him that it's quite possible to be independent even though you're growing up with vision impairment,"" she says. she arranged for them to speak to some of her clients and linked them up with other organisations and services they could tap for support. it was a great comfort to the couple.  ""what we wanted at that point in time was just reassurance, that somebody understood what we were going through,"" says eric.  ""she's been a great help. ""they count her as one of their friends now.  she visits them regularly, teaching them how to interact and play with elliot, and even brings along her husband and eight-month-old baby. bringing up babyas the months went by, the family developed their own routine.  it bears similarities to those of other families with young children, but with noticeable tweaks. during breakfast, wei shi puts elliot's hand on her jaw so he can feel the chewing motion.  it is to encourage him, but it is no picnic; he does not like food, and the colourful vegetables in his porridge do nothing to entice him. ""in the past, i introduced exciting stuff with different textures.  but it was disappointing if he didn't eat,"" she says.  ""nowadays i don't care already.  i'd just throw everything into a pot to make porridge. ""his play area is strewn with toys that tend to make sounds or play music.  one of his favourites is a spinning toy that makes a rattling sound.  there is a dinosaur whose buttons he presses to hear sounds, and a toy piano on one side of the living room. his books are heavy on texture, have buttons that play music, and one has braille markings, passed to him from another family with a visually impaired child. wei shi points out, however, that his condition does not mean they cannot do visual activities like reading a book with him.  the activity simply must be adapted so he can understand. ""if he wasn't visually impaired, i'd probably just point to the different pictures and tell him it's a cow.  but he won't be able to relate to all this.  so i tell him this is a book, this is how a book works, you have to flip the pages and press the button,"" she cites. while there are toys that he cannot fully enjoy, such as stacking cups and animal figures, the couple make a point of letting him feel the different shapes and textures. what has met with little success, however, is an activity board filled with locks, switches and lights, known as a toddlers' busy board.  it was handmade by eric during his wife's pregnancy. the appeal of these toys often comes from children watching their parents use them.  but eric has not given up hope.  ""perhaps when he's 15, he'll start getting interested,"" quips the father. each activity they plan for him is purposeful, from the nightly baby massages to help him relax before bedtime, to naming his body parts out loud as they touch each one. like other parents, they take him out to enjoy new experiences, though the highlight of the outing may only be something like elliot sitting on artificial grass at jewel. it can be tiring, wei shi says, to plan all the activities and look after him.  but his sweet smile when he crawls to her and feels her face spurs the couple on.  that action is a sign of improvement too. ""all the lost sleep, the time spent with him to bring him to who he is today, is totally worth it,"" she says. his biggest achievementeric and wei shi learnt from the start that being blind meant elliot would have no visual motivation to lift his head and reach forward, which would result in other developmental delays, such as in standing and even crawling. so sometimes they cannot imagine he has come this far. crawling is a difficult milestone to achieve, says wei shi.  besides the lack of visual motivation, there is the fear of moving head-first into an unfamiliar, dark space.  and many visually impaired babies would skip this stage. getting the hang of it was not easy for elliot.  it took months of effort, professional therapy and his parents' perseverance with shaking a rattle in front of him to encourage him before he began making tentative movements forward. ""i would've been okay if he'd skipped crawling altogether.  i thought it was just good exercise for him,"" says wei shi.  ""but one fine day, he just pushed up and started crawling. ""i was really, really proud of him. ""their pride grows when they see him exploring the house by himself, even the corners he had not explored before, or moving across the living room to get closer to the sound of nursery rhymes from the television. he now goes for physiotherapy, speech therapy and occupational therapy about once a month at kk women's and children's hospital.  and they have high hopes for him once again. ""nobody wants their kid to be lousy,"" says eric.  ""like any other singaporean parent, our initial thought was for our baby to be rich, successful and happy with what he does. ""while that changed when they discovered elliot's condition, they have come to understand over the months that he can achieve as much as a sighted person. ""our expectations shouldn't be (lowered) from . . .  'i want my kid to be successful' to 'okay, just be independent,'"" says eric.  ""you just have to realise that he'll have to reach these targets in a different way. ""dealing with reactions from others, however, is still a work in progress. eric was recently reminded of an incident when elliot was about six months old and was wearing baby spectacles that stopped him pressing his eyes, a tendency among visually impaired children that could result in sunken eyes, notes wei shi. he was in a baby carrier with eric, who was picking up breakfast for the family, and on that one trip, at least three people stopped to ask about the spectacles. ""i just got annoyed and walked away,"" recalls eric, who also felt sad.  ""at that point in time, we'd accepted it . . .  but it's generally not so easy to just start telling people and open up about it. ""last month, when elliot received his first cane — a blue, child-sized one — the emotions hit home again. ""we're not ashamed of him.  and we know that the best thing to do is to get him used to walking with a cane so he can be independent as soon as possible,"" says eric. ""but when people can easily tell he's visually impaired . . .  i don't feel i'm ready to go out there and explain yet. ""raising awarenesswei shi says that before her son came along, she had never interacted closely with a visually impaired person, let alone be friends with one.  in parenting elliot, she and eric have grown more socially aware. they began noticing little things that could help a blind person to navigate through society.  not all public buses and traffic lights, for example, have audio cues.  even escalators could provide auditory cues for approaching users to inform them of the direction, cites eric. pre-school education is also a challenge.  the couple began approaching schools a year ahead of their son turning 18 months old.  out of ""more than 10 schools"", most rejected them, despite the kohs' offer to bring in a vision therapist to guide the teachers on how to work with elliot. ""the reason they gave is along the lines of . . .  'we're afraid we don't know how to take care of the baby properly,'"" he says. ""i understand this from their perspective . . .  liability is something no company would want to have.  but we just wanted them to be a little more understanding and inclusive. ""eventually, they found a school willing to help them. ""compared to 10 years ago, when there was less awareness of the needs of the special needs community, today's society has made great progress,"" he adds.  ""but obviously, as a parent, i hope more can be done. ""wei shi is doing her part with an instagram account she created in september to document elliot's developmental milestones and the various ways she helps him learn. the account, @blindandshine, has more than 1,500 followers.  she has also attracted some collaborations with brands.  ""i don't want any other pair of parents to feel the helplessness that we felt should the same thing happen to them,"" she says. she can also advocate for elliot at a pragmatic level, for example after he received three sets of braille blocks for christmas.  these well-intentioned gifts were the likely result of a google search for ""braille toys"", she says. ""(but) people have the misunderstanding that maybe he can't play with normal toys,"" wei shi adds.  ""he can, just maybe he needs adaptations. ""she knew, however, where they were coming from — she had once been in their shoes.  ""i had preconceived thoughts, not because i'm an elitist but simply because of a lack of awareness.  and nobody told me these things,"" she says. love is blindthe change the couple have undergone in their lives in the past year has been both unexpected and dramatic.  every month, however, they still take a family photo, their camera set up on a tripod as they coax elliot to face forward. ""he always looks down,"" says wei shi.  ""it's not meaningful for him because he doesn't know why we're pausing. ""but each photo is lovingly saved, not so much for him to enjoy in future but for his parents to look back on as he grows. just visible in the background of one of the photos on their wall is a pegboard with the words ""today's brew"", mimicking the look of a cafe. today, the board stands on the television console, unmissable as one enters their home — and it reads ""love's blind"".  because the love within the family, as wei shi says, comes from the heart rather than by sight. they still grieve over what could have been, but it is not a case of ""oh, we're so sad"", says eric. ""we didn't know this was going to happen.  but looking at his growth and happiness, we're just as happy taking care of him as any other parent would be of their child. ""to mark each milestone in elliot's life, such as his first birthday or when he got his first cane, eric also takes out a recorder and documents the moment with his voice. ""today, people will know your story, and you'll inspire many people,"" eric talks away into the recorder.  ""you want to be an influencer and earn money? be a politician? also can.

photos of baby elliot displayed above the koh family's dining table."", 'they provide a window into a time when life was very different for his parents.', 'in one, elliot is just out of hospital, a newborn being burped by his father.', ""in another, he is cuddled up to his mother, warmly dressed against the spray of jewel's indoor waterfall."", 'there is also one of his parents kissing him, their arms encircling him protectively.', 'eric, 32, and wei shi, 31, put the photos up one evening last july when elliot was four months old.', 'they were looking forward to showing them to him as he grew older.', 'they have never got to do so.', 'the very next day, they brought him to the doctor, suspecting a developmental delay.', 'a day later, they found out elliot was blind and was unlikely to ever have sight.', 'eric remembers both of them bursting into tears on the spot.', '""my wife was still listening to the doctor intently to hear his explanation and diagnosis,"" he says.', '""i just walked out of the room and cried.', '""nothing much needed to be said.', '""the clinic was crowded, but his world went silent when he walked out of the doctor\'s office.', 'he called his mother, broke it to her and they cried on the phone together.', 'he was still in shock as he tried to process how it had come to this.', ""it started with a comment from wei shi's father, who had noticed elliot seemingly having trouble tracking things with his eyes."", 'the couple did not think much of it then.', 'newborns often do not see very well yet, and their son would catch up, they rationalised.', 'but the signs kept coming.', 'he showed no interest in the toys his grandmother placed in front of him.', 'he did not seem to smile or look at his surroundings.', ""and when wei shi brought elliot on a play date, she noticed that her friend's baby of the same age was curious and excited, reaching out to grab toys, while elliot remained passive and did not lift his head."", 'at that point, they decided to take him to a doctor, although they were still ""not too worried"".', 'but the paediatrician referred them to an ophthalmologist, who gave them the news that shook their world.', 'it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.', 'the couple did not exchange many words that day.', 'but questions kept running through their minds.', 'what could they do for elliot?', 'what will happen to him when they are gone?wei shi could not help but wonder: had she done anything — maybe it was her diet or lifestyle — during her pregnancy or even during the delivery that could have resulted in this?but eric made it clear that neither of them was to blame.', '""we can\'t solve the problem just by assigning blame,"" he says.', '""i was just focused on providing support for elliot and wei shi, just to be there and give them what they need.', '""elliot, now 15 months old, was eventually diagnosed with leber congenital amaurosis, an inherited disease that causes vision loss.', ""it affects about two to three newborns in every 100,000 births, according to the united states' national library of medicine and the american association for paediatric ophthalmology and strabismus."", '""the doctors said it wasn\'t detectable on any scan because the retinas were just so tiny.', 'and it\'s not something that was avoidable,"" she added.', 'once i knew that, i started to think that maybe i should focus on what i can control rather than the past, which is beyond my control.', 'a new frienderic and wei shi wanted more answers to all the questions they had.', 'being young, modern parents, as they described themselves, they turned to google first.', 'they searched for the abstract, like how the blind visualise things, as well as answers as to how they could interact with and take care of elliot.', ""watch: raising a blind baby and the lessons we've learnt from it (12:02)they joined facebook groups for parents of children with the same disorder."", 'while these were international groups, it was encouraging to see that the other children were growing up well.', 'the couple also picked up useful tips on caring for elliot, but the issue was a lack of local context.', 'they knew his condition was rare but had still hoped that help would be readily available for blind infants in singapore.', 'for example, wei shi remembers looking for pre-schools or specialised therapies for visually impaired babies and children.', 'but she came away disappointed.', '""it made me panic a little because i didn\'t know better,"" she says.', '""and if there\'s nothing on the internet, where can i find this information?', '""she recalls asking the doctors as much as possible about what to expect and so on.', 'but there were times the couple were also at a loss to know what to ask, she adds.', 'help came from an unexpected source.', ""as eric sat in hospital waiting for elliot to undergo tests, he flicked his phone's screen and went on reddit, which he browsed regularly."", 'he had never made a post on the forum — but that day, he did.', 'it was, simply: baby born blind.', 'need help.', 'the replies he got surprised and touched him.', 'some pointed out local resources and organisations that support the blind; others said they had visually impaired friends and were happy to share their experiences.', '""people were so willing to help,"" he says.', '""they gave us more than enough resources for us to get by.', '""that was how they met cheryl yeo.', 'an orientation and mobility specialist from guide dogs singapore, the 29-year-old teaches people with visual impairment how to travel independently, and the skills they eventually need to use a guide dog.', 'the kohs had tried ringing up several organisations but could not get through in the post-circuit breaker period, with people still working from home.', 'cheryl, whose calls were rerouted to her mobile, was the first person to call them back.', 'the conversation lasted almost two hours.', 'the couple were anxious and, she recalls, sounded overwhelmed.', '""one of the big questions eric asked was whether elliot would be able to get a girlfriend,"" she says.', '""it\'s rather funny, but it\'s actually quite a big concern because it\'s about how he\'s going to grow up, be like everyone else and find a job.', '""she told them stories about her clients, like the schools they attended, their jobs and, in answer to eric\'s question, how some of them were looking for girlfriends.', '""it\'s just (about) showing him that it\'s quite possible to be independent even though you\'re growing up with vision impairment,"" she says.', 'she arranged for them to speak to some of her clients and linked them up with other organisations and services they could tap for support.', 'it was a great comfort to the couple.', '""what we wanted at that point in time was just reassurance, that somebody understood what we were going through,"" says eric.', '""she\'s been a great help.', '""they count her as one of their friends now.', 'she visits them regularly, teaching them how to interact and play with elliot, and even brings along her husband and eight-month-old baby.', 'bringing up babyas the months went by, the family developed their own routine.', 'it bears similarities to those of other families with young children, but with noticeable tweaks.', ""during breakfast, wei shi puts elliot's hand on her jaw so he can feel the chewing motion."", 'it is to encourage him, but it is no picnic; he does not like food, and the colourful vegetables in his porridge do nothing to entice him.', '""in the past, i introduced exciting stuff with different textures.', 'but it was disappointing if he didn\'t eat,"" she says.', '""nowadays i don\'t care already.', ""i'd just throw everything into a pot to make porridge."", '""his play area is strewn with toys that tend to make sounds or play music.', 'one of his favourites is a spinning toy that makes a rattling sound.', 'there is a dinosaur whose buttons he presses to hear sounds, and a toy piano on one side of the living room.', 'his books are heavy on texture, have buttons that play music, and one has braille markings, passed to him from another family with a visually impaired child.', 'wei shi points out, however, that his condition does not mean they cannot do visual activities like reading a book with him.', 'the activity simply must be adapted so he can understand.', '""if he wasn\'t visually impaired, i\'d probably just point to the different pictures and tell him it\'s a cow.', ""but he won't be able to relate to all this."", 'so i tell him this is a book, this is how a book works, you have to flip the pages and press the button,"" she cites.', 'while there are toys that he cannot fully enjoy, such as stacking cups and animal figures, the couple make a point of letting him feel the different shapes and textures.', ""what has met with little success, however, is an activity board filled with locks, switches and lights, known as a toddlers' busy board."", ""it was handmade by eric during his wife's pregnancy."", 'the appeal of these toys often comes from children watching their parents use them.', 'but eric has not given up hope.', '""perhaps when he\'s 15, he\'ll start getting interested,"" quips the father.', 'each activity they plan for him is purposeful, from the nightly baby massages to help him relax before bedtime, to naming his body parts out loud as they touch each one.', 'like other parents, they take him out to enjoy new experiences, though the highlight of the outing may only be something like elliot sitting on artificial grass at jewel.', 'it can be tiring, wei shi says, to plan all the activities and look after him.', 'but his sweet smile when he crawls to her and feels her face spurs the couple on.', 'that action is a sign of improvement too.', '""all the lost sleep, the time spent with him to bring him to who he is today, is totally worth it,"" she says.', 'his biggest achievementeric and wei shi learnt from the start that being blind meant elliot would have no visual motivation to lift his head and reach forward, which would result in other developmental delays, such as in standing and even crawling.', 'so sometimes they cannot imagine he has come this far.', 'crawling is a difficult milestone to achieve, says wei shi.', 'besides the lack of visual motivation, there is the fear of moving head-first into an unfamiliar, dark space.', 'and many visually impaired babies would skip this stage.', 'getting the hang of it was not easy for elliot.', ""it took months of effort, professional therapy and his parents' perseverance with shaking a rattle in front of him to encourage him before he began making tentative movements forward."", '""i would\'ve been okay if he\'d skipped crawling altogether.', 'i thought it was just good exercise for him,"" says wei shi.', '""but one fine day, he just pushed up and started crawling.', '""i was really, really proud of him.', '""their pride grows when they see him exploring the house by himself, even the corners he had not explored before, or moving across the living room to get closer to the sound of nursery rhymes from the television.', ""he now goes for physiotherapy, speech therapy and occupational therapy about once a month at kk women's and children's hospital."", 'and they have high hopes for him once again.', '""nobody wants their kid to be lousy,"" says eric.', '""like any other singaporean parent, our initial thought was for our baby to be rich, successful and happy with what he does.', '""while that changed when they discovered elliot\'s condition, they have come to understand over the months that he can achieve as much as a sighted person.', '""our expectations shouldn\'t be (lowered) from .', '.', '.', '\'i want my kid to be successful\' to \'okay, just be independent,\'"" says eric.', '""you just have to realise that he\'ll have to reach these targets in a different way.', '""dealing with reactions from others, however, is still a work in progress.', 'eric was recently reminded of an incident when elliot was about six months old and was wearing baby spectacles that stopped him pressing his eyes, a tendency among visually impaired children that could result in sunken eyes, notes wei shi.', 'he was in a baby carrier with eric, who was picking up breakfast for the family, and on that one trip, at least three people stopped to ask about the spectacles.', '""i just got annoyed and walked away,"" recalls eric, who also felt sad.', '""at that point in time, we\'d accepted it .', '.', '.', ""but it's generally not so easy to just start telling people and open up about it."", '""last month, when elliot received his first cane — a blue, child-sized one — the emotions hit home again.', '""we\'re not ashamed of him.', 'and we know that the best thing to do is to get him used to walking with a cane so he can be independent as soon as possible,"" says eric.', '""but when people can easily tell he\'s visually impaired .', '.', '.', ""i don't feel i'm ready to go out there and explain yet."", '""raising awarenesswei shi says that before her son came along, she had never interacted closely with a visually impaired person, let alone be friends with one.', 'in parenting elliot, she and eric have grown more socially aware.', 'they began noticing little things that could help a blind person to navigate through society.', 'not all public buses and traffic lights, for example, have audio cues.', 'even escalators could provide auditory cues for approaching users to inform them of the direction, cites eric.', 'pre-school education is also a challenge.', 'the couple began approaching schools a year ahead of their son turning 18 months old.', 'out of ""more than 10 schools"", most rejected them, despite the kohs\' offer to bring in a vision therapist to guide the teachers on how to work with

them.', '""compared to 10 years ago, when there was less awareness of the needs of the special needs community, today\'s society has made great progress,"" he adds.', '""but obviously, as a parent, i hope more can be done.', '""wei shi is doing her part with an instagram account she created in september to document elliot\'s developmental milestones and the various ways she helps him learn.', 'the account, @blindandshine, has more than 1,500 followers.', 'she has also attracted some collaborations with brands.', '""i don\'t want any other pair of parents to feel the helplessness that we felt should the same thing happen to them,"" she says.', 'she can also advocate for elliot at a pragmatic level, for example after he received three sets of braille blocks for christmas.', 'these well-intentioned gifts were the likely result of a google search for ""braille toys"", she says.', '""(but) people have the misunderstanding that maybe he can\'t play with normal toys,"" wei shi adds.', '""he can, just maybe he needs adaptations.', '""she knew, however, where they were coming from — she had once been in their shoes.', '""i had preconceived thoughts, not because i\'m an

console, unmissable as one enters their home — and it reads ""love\'s blind"".', 'because the love within the family, as wei shi says, comes from the heart rather than by sight.', 'they still grieve

2021-06-14,Singapore firm that developed COVID-19 breath test pivoted from detecting lung cancer to coronavirus.,"singapore: when covid-19 hit singapore early last year, local start-up breathonix had to stop all its clinical trials for its lung cancer breathalyser test due to pandemic restrictions. the company's ceo dr jia zhunan had been working on a way to detect disease from a person's breath since her days as a doctoral student. but although tests for lung cancer detection had to stop, the firm soon found a new purpose a breath test for covid-19. it was a ""natural"" switch because no other clinical trials were allowed at the time, and there was a lot of interest in a quick way to detect the highly infectious coronavirus, said breathonix's business development and strategy head wayne wee. ""the technology, the hardware, even the know-how is the same,"" the 26-year-old told cna.  ""it's just collecting a different set of data. ""on may 24, breathonix announced that its covid-19 breath analysis system was the first to secure provisional authorisation in singapore. this came a week before prime minister lee hsien loong said in anational addressthat covid-19 testing must be done ""faster, and more liberally and extensively"". many different tests have become available, such as antigen rapid tests (art), saliva tests and breathalysers, mr lee noted then, adding that diy tests will also be sold at pharmacies. trials speeded upbreathonix is supported by the national university of singapore's (nus) graduate research innovation programme. around mid-2020, the company started a small study with the national centre of infectious diseases (ncid), and the accuracy was high enough for them to expand it to a larger trial. as with many innovations linked to covid-19, what might have taken three years or more was then compressed into one year with clinical trials and regulatory approvals speeded up. and the firm did it all on a budget of less than s$1 million, said mr wee. ""it was quite a steep learning curve for us (as it was our) first time doing all these things . . .  we tried to seek consulting help from nus.  and if that's not enough, we had to source for or hire some experts to join the team,"" he added. they also had a lot of help from stakeholders like the ministry of health and ncid, said mr wee. rather than having a swab thrust up your nose, a covid-19 test using the company's brefence go covid-19 breath test system takes just one breath. the exhaled breath then passes into a mass spectrometer, and the breath is analysed for volatile organic compounds (voc) or biomarkers that indicate covid-19 infection. the trick, says mr wee, is to figure out what vocs to look for and what to ignore.  for example, smokers or people who have consumed alcohol would emit certain vocs, which the analysis would omit. it currently has an accuracy of 85. 7 per cent sensitivity and 97 per cent specificity correctly identifying those without the disease.  clinical trials are ongoing with an algorithm with artificial intelligence to further improve accuracy. the world health organization (who) recommends a sensitivity of 80 per cent and specificity of 97 per cent for rapid antigen tests (art), while the gold standard for covid-19 tests remains the polymerase chain reaction or pcr test. both art and pcr tests require nasal swabs.  while art tests can produce results in 30 minutes, it may take a day for pcr tests. ""less than a second to process""according to mr wee, their breath test takes only 40 to 60 seconds, which eliminates the need for a holding area while people wait for test results. ""once we capture the data from the breath, the analysis of our own algorithm takes less than a second to process . . .  we are able to give the results in real-time to the person on the spot,"" he said. ""if you're tested negative, you are cleared to go . . .  if you're tested positive, you will be redirected to take the pcr test and then you'll be isolated or quarantined. ""another advantage is that the test can be conducted by trained non-medical staff members. a pilot deployment at tuas checkpoint started on may 31 and is still ongoing.  the machine is placed at different locations at the checkpoint to see if it is suited for use in such an environment. for example, the team thought that strong winds or car fumes may affect the test results, but the performance so far has been ""quite promising"", said mr wee. beyond singapore, breathonix is looking at other countries, including malaysia and vietnam, for more trials.  it has already conducted trials at changi airport, as well as in dubai, and are seeking approval in the united arab emirates. it hopes to get full approval from singapore's health sciences authority by the end of the year. each test costs us$5 to us$20, depending on the volume of the deployment, which is much cheaper than pcr tests, said mr wee. it is thus useful for venues with high traffic like large events, schools, worker dormitories or workplaces where routine testing is done. ""our bigger vision is really to make breath tests (an) annual screening tool for every single individual,"" said mr wee. ""on top of doing a blood test and other tests, you also do a breath test, where we are able to detect and identify if you are at risk of any disease . . .  such as lung cancer, nose cancer, tuberculosis, maybe even flu.

sections of fans at wembley stadium booed england players for taking a knee before the european championship game against croatia on sunday. the boos, which could be heard over those fans applauding, came despite pleas from the team to respect the anti-racism gesture.  croatia's players did not take a knee as expected ahead of the group d game, which england won 1-0. ""everybody should cheer for england,"" british prime minister boris johnson said a short time later at the g7 summit, while not saying if he would take a knee if he was a player. some england fans claim taking a knee is a political act but the english football association said again ahead of the team's opening euro 2020 match that the gesture is important to them and should be respected.  there had been booing at england's two warmup games for the tournament that were played in middlesbrough. ""they are doing this as a mechanism of peacefully protesting against discrimination, injustice and inequality,"" the fa said in a statement to fans.  ""this is personally important to the players and the values the team collectively represents.  this gesture of unity and fighting against inequality can be traced back as far as the 18th century. ""it is not new, and english football has made it very clear that it does not view this as being aligned to a political organisation or ideology.  there can be no doubt as to why the players are taking the knee and what it represents in a footballing context. ""the jeering was by some fans who also chanted ""no surrender"" during the national anthem.  that's a dated reference to the conflict endured for generations that saw britain hit by terrorist attacks from the irish republic army. croatia's national anthem was also booed by some of the 22,500 fans allowed into wembley, which could lead to the country's soccer association being fined by uefa. 100% online and fully accredited, level 7 qualification for board directors.  over six months, develop the skills to become a confident and truly effective board membercroatia's national anthem was also booed by some of the 22,500 fans allowed into wembleythat is generous.   i could hardly hear that anthem over the booing.   may have been the coverage though, and different at the match.  good on the england players for drawing attention to a cause that has meaning for them. get politics out of sport.   just play the game. the boos were drowned out by most of the fans applauding.  great match, england were great. well they were booing because the knee taking means nothing. i stand with wilfred zaha on that issue. what do we expect with one of the most reactionary right-wing governments ever?they took the knee and sterling took the boot!ludditetoday  07:56 am jstthe boos were drowned out by most of the fans applauding. yes, that's what i heard on my tv.  a timely reminder that the edl/bnp/ukip knuckle draggers are a small minority.  mickelicioustoday  08:29 am jstwhat do we expect with one of the most reactionary right-wing governments ever?every time this topic is raised with lying johnson i expect him to say, ""gosh.  look, yes.  jolly good.  fine people on both sides.  certainly.  i think.

2021-06-14,"Heart inflammation after Covid-19 jab rare: Experts, Singapore News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. heart conditions associated with the covid-19 mrna vaccines are extremely rare and it remains unclear if the vaccines are responsible for them, experts told the straits times after a handful of cases raised some concerns. six individuals here were reported to have suffered myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after getting an mrna vaccine, among whom four are young men less than 30 years old.  the other two are a man and a woman both aged above 40. the health sciences authority (hsa) said most of the cases had occurred within a few days after receiving the second dose of the vaccine, and that all have recovered or been discharged well from hospital. the united states and israel two major users of the mrna vaccines have also reported a slightly increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis in young men after the second dose of mrna vaccination. but there is no need to be overly concerned as these events are rare, experts said. professor ooi eng eong, an expert on emerging infectious diseases at duke-nus medical school, said it also remains unclear if it is indeed mrna vaccines causing these adverse events and how vaccination could have resulted in them. as at june 7, more than 1,888,000 people in singapore have received both doses of mrna vaccines by either pfizer biontech or moderna. an article last friday by the american academy of paediatrics cited a rate of 16 cases of myocarditis/pericarditis per million second doses in people aged 16 to 39 years old. such inflammation of the heart was also reported in some covid-19 patients last year, most likely the result of an overactive immune system giving rise to the inflammation. vaccine maker moderna issued a statement last friday stating that it is aware of reports of such cases after people took its vaccine, but added that it has not established a causal association with its vaccine after carefully reviewing the available safety data to date. as mrna vaccines lead to a similar, but milder, immune response, they could also give rise to inflammation, said prof ooi. ""but these cases, if indeed caused by the vaccine, will be much fewer compared with covid-19-induced heart inflammation ones. ""it is also important to note that the occurrence of some rare events is natural for any vaccine, especially when large numbers have been vaccinated, he stressed. ""no other vaccine has come under the scrutiny as covid-19 vaccines.  in about six months, over 1. 5 billion people have been vaccinated under close observation,"" he added. he said it is unclear why young men may be more susceptible, and that it is difficult to conduct the necessary studies to determine a correlation.

vaccines are extremely rare and it remains unclear if the vaccines are responsible for them, experts told the straits times after a handful of cases raised some concerns.', 'six individuals here were reported to have suffered myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after getting an mrna vaccine, among whom four are young men less than 30 years old.', 'the other two are a man and a woman both aged above 40. the health sciences authority (hsa) said most of the cases had occurred within a few days after receiving the second dose of the vaccine, and that all have recovered or been discharged well from hospital.', 'the united states and israel two major users of the mrna vaccines have also reported a slightly increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis in young men after the second dose of mrna vaccination.', 'but there is no need to be overly concerned as these events are rare, experts said.', 'professor ooi eng eong, an expert on emerging infectious diseases at duke-nus medical school, said it also remains unclear if it is indeed mrna vaccines causing these adverse events and how vaccination could have resulted in them.', 'as at june 7, more than 1,888,000 people in singapore have received both doses of mrna vaccines by either pfizer biontech or moderna.', 'an article last friday by the american academy of paediatrics cited a rate of 16 cases of myocarditis/pericarditis per million second doses in people aged 16 to 39 years old.', 'such inflammation of the heart was also reported in some covid-19 patients last year, most likely the result of an overactive immune system giving rise to the inflammation.', 'vaccine maker moderna issued a statement last friday stating that it is aware of reports of such cases after people took its vaccine, but added that it has not established a causal association with its vaccine after carefully reviewing the available safety data to date.', 'as mrna vaccines lead to a similar, but milder, immune response, they could also give rise to inflammation, said prof ooi.', '""but these cases, if indeed caused by the vaccine, will be much fewer compared with covid-19-induced heart inflammation ones.', '""it is also important to note that the occurrence of some rare events is natural for any vaccine, especially when large numbers have been vaccinated,

2021-06-14,"Rare earth metals at the heart of China's rivalry with US, Europe.","what if china were to cut off the united states and europe from access to rare minerals that are essential to electric vehicles, wind turbines and drones?at a time of frequent geopolitical friction among those three powers, washington and brussels want to avoid this scenario by investing in the market for 17 minerals with unique properties that today are largely extracted and refined in china. ""the expected exponential growth in demand for minerals that are linked to clean energy is putting more pressure on us and europe to take a closer look at where the vulnerabilities are and the concrete steps these governments can take,"" said jane nakano, a senior fellow at the washington-based center for strategic and international studies. in 2019, the united states imported 80 percent of its rare earth minerals from china, the us geological survey says. the european union gets 98 percent of its supply from china, the european commission said last year. amid the transition to green energy in which rare earth minerals are sure to play a role, china's market dominance is enough to sound an alarm in western capitals. cars and turbines -rare earth minerals with names like neodymium, praseodymium and dysprosium are crucial to the manufacture of magnets used in industries of the future like wind turbines and electric cars.  and they are already present in consumer goods such as smartphones, computer screens and telescopic lenses. others have more traditional uses, like cerium for glass polishing and lanthanum for car catalysts or optical lenses. this week the us senate passed a law aimed at improving american competitiveness that includes provisions to improve critical minerals supply chains, following a similar executive order issued by president joe biden in february. washington aims to boost production and processing of rare earths and lithium, another key mineral component, while ""working with allies and partners to increase sustainable global supply and reduce reliance on geopolitical competitors,"" deputy director of the national economic council sameera fazili said tuesday. boosting us production -the best hope for boosting american production can be found at the mountain pass mine in california. once one of the major players in the sector, the mine suffered as china rose and ate up its market share, aided by beijing's heavy government subsidies. mp materials relaunched the mine in 2017 and aims to make it a symbol of america's industrial rebirth, saying the concentration of rare earths at its site is one of the world's largest and highest-grade rare earth deposits, with soil concentrations of seven percent versus 0. 1 to four percent elsewhere. the company's aim is to separate rare earth minerals from each other via a chemical process, and then by 2025 manufacture the magnets that industry uses -- as market-leading chinese firms currently do. the project was supported by the us government, while a chinese firm is a minority shareholder. elsewhere, australian company lynas has won several contracts in the united states, including an ore refinery in texas for the military that was supported by the defense department. complications for europe -in europe, bernd schafer, ceo and managing director of rare earth mineral consortium eit raw materials, said this month that an ""action plan"" will soon be presented to the european commission on how to boost production. europe, however, faces a more complicated path to achieving this goal, said david merriman, a specialist in batteries and electric cars for london-based consultancy roskill. ""europe is expected to rely on importing raw materials or semi-processed materials and become more a processing base or recycling base,"" he said. china is expected to remain dominant for some time to come, but schafer said that if recycling is scaled up, ""20 to 30 percent of europe's rare earth magnet needs by 2030 could be sourced domestically in the eu from literally zero today. ""the desire to accelerate rare earth production comes amid a shortage of semiconductors, which are essential for the computing and automotive industries and mostly manufactured in asia. the scarcity ""has caused global manufacturers to think about their supply chain in a new way, and think about vulnerabilities,"" a spokesman for mp materials said, adding that several european automotive and wind power firms are already in contact with the company. alb/cs/dwit is compulsory to have your car insured in singapore.  why not make the most of it by looking for the best car insurance plan in town when your policy is up for renewal? while it can be tempting to simply renew your existing car [. . . ] the post 5 best car insurance plans in singapore (2021) appeared first on singsaver blog we compare, you save. newly-crowned french open champion barbora krejcikova hailed her mentor and former wimbledon champion jana novotna who died in 2017, saying: ""at the end of her life, i had to be there.

taking the country's total case count to 62,276. of the new cases, 10 are community transmissions with eight linked to past cases, said moh in a news release.  five of the community cases have already been placed on quarantine, while three were detected through surveillance.  the remaining two community cases are unlinked.  there are no new cases from the migrant worker dormitories. moh also reported three imported cases, all of whom have been placed on stay-home notice since their arrival in singapore. of the 13 new cases, seven are asymptomatic, and were detected from screening and surveillance, while six were symptomatic. overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased from 116 cases in the week before to 36 cases in the past week.  the number of unlinked cases in the community has also fallen from 17 cases in the week before to 15 cases in the past week. the two unlinked cases are a 23-year-old fully vaccinated male india national who works as a nursing aide at all saints home (hougang) and a 27-year-old male india national who works as an engineer at ecoxplore.  the latter case is the source of a new cluster named after his case number. there are four cases linked to the new cluster.  they are:a 50-year-old bangladeshi man who is employed by theng liang lee services as a conservancy worker at 115 bukit merah view market & food centre. a 72-year-old singaporean man who is fully vaccinated and works at a sundry shop at the location. a 67-year-old singaporean woman who is fully vaccinated and a food stall vendor at the location. a 65-year-old singaporean man who is fully vaccinated and a food stall vendor at the location. the food centre is closed to all members of the public for three days from sunday to 15 june, as moh's epidemiological investigations have found that there is likely ongoing transmission among individuals who work at the location. all staff and tenants who have been working at the location from 25 may have been placed on quarantine, and will be tested during quarantine.  in order to disrupt any wider, undetected community transmission, moh will conduct special testing operations for all staff and tenants who have been working in 116 bukit merah view from 25 may.  moh will also extend free covid-19 testing to members of the public who had visited the shops at 115 and 116 bukit merah view between 25 may and 12 june. there are two new cases linked to the cluster, named after the case number of the 27-year-old male india national who works at ecoxplore. they are a 19-year-old singaporean woman who works as a warehouse assistant at dhl express (singapore) and a 39-year-old singaporean woman who is employed by cleen first services as a cleaner at emerald park condominium.  both are household contacts and family members to each another.  they are household contacts of the male india national. two cases are linked and not part of a cluster.  one of them is a 59-year-old singaporean woman who works as a part-time cleaner at crystal lodge and is a close contact of a previous case.  the other is a 66-year-old singaporean man who is a retiree, and a family member of a previous case.  of the three imported cases, two are singapore permanent residents who returned from india, and one is a work permit holder who arrived from indonesia and is a foreign domestic worker. with 31 more patients discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities on sunday, 61,869 cases – or 99. 3 per cent of the total – have fully recovered from the infection. most of the 130 hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while one of them is in critical condition in the intensive care unit. a total of 243 patients – with mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive – are isolated and cared for at community facilities. apart from the 34 patients who have died from covid-19 complications, 15 others who tested positive for the virus were determined to have died from unrelated causes, including three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and another four, whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease. among the 80 confirmed cases

2021-06-14,G7: World leaders promise one billion Covid vaccine doses for poorer nations.,"by joseph lee & becky mortonbbc newsleaders of the major industrial nations have pledged one billion covid vaccine doses to poor countries as a ""big step towards vaccinating the world"", boris johnson has said. at the end of the g7 summit in cornwall, the pm said countries were rejecting ""nationalistic approaches"". he said vaccinating the world would show the benefits of the g7's democratic values. there was also a pledge to wipe out their contribution to climate change. after the first meeting of world leaders in two years, mr johnson said ""the world was looking to us to reject some of the selfish, nationalistic approaches that marred the initial global response to the pandemic and to channel all our diplomatic, economic and scientific might to defeating covid for good"". he said the g7 leaders had pledged to supply the vaccines to poor countries either directly or through the world health organization's covax scheme including 100 million from the uk. the communique issued by the summit pledges to ""end the pandemic and prepare for the future by driving an intensified international effort, starting immediately, to vaccinate the world by getting as many safe vaccines to as many people as possible as fast as possible"".  it also includes steps to tackle climate change, with leaders re-committing to the target of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 at the latest and pledging to eliminate most coal power.  mr johnson rejected suggestions the vaccines pledge was a moral failure by the g7 as it was not enough to cover the needs of poorer countries. he referred to the the uk's involvement in the development of the oxford-astrazeneca vaccine. ""already of the 1. 5 billion vaccines that have been distributed around the world, i think that people in this country should be very proud that half a billion of them are as a result of the actions taken by the uk government in doing that deal with the oxford scientists and astrazeneca to distribute it at cost,"" he said. he added that ""we are going flat out and we are producing vaccines as fast as we can, and distributing them as fast as we can"". the target to vaccinate the world by the end of next year would be met ""very largely thanks to the efforts of the countries who have come here today"", mr johnson said. the leaders slightly exceeded their target of donating a billion covid vaccines to poorer countries within the next year, if funding for future doses is included alongside individual jabs.  there was also a commitment to build the frameworks to prevent and fight future pandemics.  elsewhere in the 25-page communique, there were several references to china, which president biden said was a change from previous meetings of the world's advanced economies.  pledges made this time included working together to respond to china's impact on world trade.  on the recovery from covid there was even a reference to prime minister boris johnson's trademark domestic policy the need to reduce inequalities by ""levelling up"". charities and campaigners issued statements calling out vague promises and missed opportunities, but mr johnson will feel that post-brexit britain has staged a diplomatic show that was both competent and confident. mr johnson also dismissed the suggestion that patents for vaccines should be waived in order to boost global supply, something which the us backed last month. he said he wanted to protect ""incentives for innovation"" while building up manufacturing capacity, especially in africa. elsewhere in their communique, g7 leaders also pledged to: the communique calls for a ""timely, transparent, expert-led, and science-based who-convened"" investigation into the origins of covid-19. us president joe biden has previously said the us intelligence community is split on whether coronavirus came from human contact with an infected animal or from a lab accident a theory rejected by china. mr johnson said ""the advice that we've had is it doesn't look as though this particular disease of zoonotic origin came from a lab"", but he added: ""clearly anybody sensible would want to keep an open mind about that"". french president emmanuel macron said the international community needed clarity about the origins of the virus but said it was up to the who to investigate. with g7 countries accounting for 20% of carbon emissions, mr johnson said: ""we were clear this weekend that action needs to start with us. ""but pressed on the lack of binding agreements and timetables, the prime minister says he will not ""pretend our work is done"" and he will be ""on everybody's case"" to make further progress ahead of the cop26 summit in scotland later this year. kirsty mcneill from crack the crises, a coalition of charities and ngos including save the children and oxfam, said the g7 summit was a ""historic missed opportunity"" on covid-19 and climate change. leaders arrived ""with good intentions but without their cheque books"", she said. joanna rea, from unicef uk, said the g7 pledge on vaccines was ""the beginning of the action required to end this pandemic"" but called for a ""rapid acceleration of dose sharing in the next three months to ensure millions of vaccines get to the people in countries who need them the most"". how significant are g7's climate pledges?in pictures: world leaders bask in cornwall sun at g7 summitg7 pledges climate action but disappoints activistsisrael's new pm bennett vows to unite nationhis pledge comes as his government is voted in, ending benjamin netanyahu's 12-year hold on power. lockdown easing in england to be delayedg7 leaders promise one billion vaccine doseswhat putin really wants from bidenhow chinaâs youth are shunning the rat race'we make it or we die' video'we make it or we die'netanyahu: a shrewd leader who reshaped israeltech firms use remote monitoring to help honey beeswhat happened when the soviets tried to dig to the centre of the earth?the rebels working with islamic state in central africaformer farmer, 84, is accidental asmr youtube star.  videoformer farmer, 84, is accidental asmr youtube star'i lost my father and pregnant wife to covid'football phrases15 sayings from around the worldlockdown easing in england to be delayed1israel's new pm bennett vows to unite nation2what putin really wants from biden3whatsapp launches privacy campaign after backlash4china to g7: small groups do not rule the world5queen meets joe biden at windsor castle6how chinaâs youth are shunning the rat race7thousands join protests against catalan pardons8swiss voters reject key climate change measures9eriksen suffered cardiac arrest doctor10â© 2021 bbc.  the bbc is not responsible for the content of external sites.  read about our approach to external linking.

2021-06-14,[UPDATE] Tackling challenges faced by Covid-hit construction sector.,"singapore (edgeprop) lego-style modular construction or prefabricated prefinished volumetric construction (ppvc) was intended to wean singapore's construction sector from its dependence on a foreign workforce.  it is faster, more efficient and environmentally friendly compared to conventional construction.  (see also: covid-19 catalyses digitalisation in construction)however, even ppvc specialists have not been spared the ravages of the covid pandemic.  they have been just as affected by the travel ban on long-term pass holders from india and bangladesh due to a surge in covid infections.  this immediately cut off the supply of construction workers from the two main source countries. the ppvc method does not require as many workers onsite compared to a conventional construction site.  (picture: samuel isaac chua/the edge singapore)""based on my experience, the construction industry is facing a 20%-30% shortage in foreign manpower, and the situation is aggravated by the tighter border controls,"" says khor yew chai, director (ppvc) at dragages singapore, a member of bouygues constrution, a global leader in the building sector. under the ppvc method, frameworks and modules are built in a factory off-site.  ""we still need workers in these factories to produce the modules,"" adds khor.  ""the difference is that with ppvc, we do not require as many workers onsite compared to a conventional construction site. ""dragages' modules are built in a factory located in johor, malaysia, before being transported to a factory in singapore to be assembled.  however, most of the construction materials are imported from overseas, especially china, notes khor.  ""the rise in costs of sea transport and raw materials since last year is a challenge for contractors trying to complete their projects on schedule,"" he adds. lego-style assembly onsite.  (picture: samuel isaac chua/the edge singapore)dragages is not alone.  many of the precast components are manufactured in malaysia, notes tan cheng chuah, managing director of construction professionals and pm link, two companies under cpg corp, a professional development consultancy firm. malaysia entered a 14-day covid ""total lockdown"" with effect from june 1 to contain its daily infections.  it has since been extended by another two weeks to june 28.  ""the initial movement control order and the current full movement control order have impacted the completion timelines for ongoing projects in singapore as precast factories in malaysia have to stop production and deliveries,"" continues tan.  ""the result is that overall tender prices for construction projects have escalated by 20%-30% over the past year. ""productivity at construction sites has dropped due to the safe management measures (smm) introduced as part of the phase two (heightened alert) measures put in place from may 16 to june 13. the government is aware of the manpower shortage and subsequent knock-on effects on ongoing infrastructure and development projects.  in a speech at the orangetee business conference on may 24, the minister for national development, desmond lee, said: ""[the tighter border controls] has significantly worsened manpower shortages in our construction sector, as south asian countries are where we recruit and hire most of our construction work permit holders. ""this is a double-blow for the construction industry, which had already been struggling with a manpower crunch since the start of the pandemic last year.  ""we have been cautious in reopening our borders and have also been careful in bringing in migrant workers, to reduce the risk of importing the virus,"" adds lee.  ""it's a difficult trade-off. ""the minister for national development, desmond lee, speaking at ​the orangetee business conference on may 24.  (picture: orangetee)last year, the government introduced a $1. 36 billion construction support package to help contractors bear part of the additional costs they had to incur due to construction delays and smm. the government has stepped in with more support measures, including an additional 49-day extension for public-sector construction projects on top of the 122-day extension under the covid-19 (temporary measures) act, or cotma, last year.  contractors who have been awarded contract sums of up to $100 million will receive 0. 1% of the awarded contract sum for every month of delay as payment for non-manpower-related qualifying costs under cotma. foreign worker levy rebates for work permit holders will be increased from $90 per worker per month to $250 per worker per month, from may to december 2021. to alleviate the manpower crunch, the government will temporarily allow new construction work-permit holders from china to enter singapore to work first and take their skills certification tests locally instead of in china. ""governmental support measures such as the jobs support scheme helped to a certain extent as they covered about 15%-20% of manpower cost.  in addition, the ex-gratia payment from the government for supporting material and equipment [purchases] also helped contractors,"" says chuck kho, deputy ceo of cpg consultants, which is part of cpg corp. kho: some of cpg consultants' clients have preferred to delay tenders due to concerns over funding, cost escalations, labour shortage, and the prolonged environment of heightened risk and uncertainty.  (picture: cpg corp. )a cotma law has been amended to allow construction companies in singapore to apply to the authorities for adjustments to contract sums so that project partners will more equitably share the burden of increased foreign manpower costs due to the covid pandemic.  ""this is to ensure no single stakeholder group in the construction industry bears an undue share of the burden imposed by covid-19,"" said minister lee in parliament on may 11. ""the co-sharing mechanisms involve some documentation process and substantiation of the qualifying costs,"" says dragages' khor.  ""the catch is that all parties involved — contractors, including subcontractors and suppliers — must have the same objective of sharing the cost. ""dragages has six ongoing projects in singapore, and is focused on completing four of them by the end of the year, for instance, the 613-unit condominium project, the garden residence; the 805-unit condominium, park colonial; and the grade-a office development, capitaspring. khor yew chai, director (ppvc) at dragages singapore, a member of bouygues constrution, a global leader in the building sector.  ppvc specialists have not been spared the ravages of the covid pandemic.  (picturel dragages singapore)most ongoing construction projects in singapore however, are facing delays of between six and 12 months, says cpg consultants' kho.  further delays are likely, he cautions, ""as overlapping problems cause a ripple effect across the industry"". for instance, some of cpg consultants' clients have preferred to delay tenders due to concerns over funding, cost escalations, labour shortage, and the prolonged environment of heightened risk and uncertainty, says kho. for firms engaged in the built environment, the main cost component in project prolongation is inevitably manpower, notes tan of construction professionals.  besides more measures on manpower cost-sharing, another way to alleviate the rise in manpower costs is for a more flexible procurement method to cushion the uncertainty due to covid, he adds. instead of an all-cost-inclusive construction tender or consultancy tender, for example, public agencies may consider including a provisional sum for costs that cannot be estimated or foreseeable in the short term, such as the costs of swab tests, prolongation costs, and the costs of implementation of mandatory smm, tan suggests. tan: one option to solve the foreign worker crunch is to train a pool of local skilled workers to reduce the reliance on foreign labour.  (picture: cpg corp. )the covid-related construction delays is taking a toll on the finances of developers and contractors.  ""if these delays are prolonged, it is likely that some of the smaller developers may face serious cashflow issues,"" warns chia ngiang hong, president of the real estate developers' association of singapore (redas). one issue that most, if not all, developers are concerned about is the additional buyer's stamp duty (absd).  since the july 2018 property cooling measures, developers are subjected to a 30% absd, of which 5% is non-remittable. developers were given a 12-month extension to the five-year project completion period last year, as part of cotma.  however, the absd period was only extended by six months, to 5. 5 years. most of the government assistance to the industry, including the reprieve to the completion deadline, was handed out close to the onset of the pandemic last year, says redas' chia.  ""if developers continue to face the threat of having to pay heavy penalties with regard to the absd on land cost, they will likely adopt a more conservative attitude when negotiating with contractors,"" he adds. an extension of the developers' absd period will provide relief from ""the time pressure"" that developers and their contractors face, continues chia. most ongoing construction projects in singapore are facing delays of between six and 12 months.  further delays are likely, as overlapping problems cause a ripple effect across the industry.  (picture: samuel isaac chua/the edge singapore)""the reality is that there is no easy solution while most singaporeans are not inclined to switch to manual labour professions, whether skilled or not,"" says cpg consultants' kho. despite rapid technological advancements taking place in the construction sector, robotics and automation cannot completely displace workers — ""at least not in the next 10 years"", says construction professionals' tan. one option to solve the foreign worker crunch is to train a pool of local skilled workers to reduce the reliance on foreign labour, adds tan.  adequate training and remuneration should be sufficient to entice local skilled construction workers to enter and stay in the industry, he argues.  ""this should go hand in hand with the widespread adoption of ppvc technology and digitalisation as a long-term solution for singapore's built environment.

""thank you for running with me for 11 years,"" the 35-year-old actor-host wrote in his post, accompanied by photos of him with a bouquet of flowers, a cake and a certificate of completion. lee had announced in april that he was leaving the wildly popular variety show due to an ankle injury he had sustained last year. as he was one of the original cast members, the production team took pains to return to the same locations where running man had started filming in july 2010. another original cast member, comedian jee seok-jin, said: ""even the staff members are sad for kwang-soo's final recording.  let's talk about him a lot today. ""lee then retorted: ""you didn't say anything while we weren't recording, but as soon as the cameras turned on, you came out with that line ready.

2021-06-14,Australia's Victoria state expects further easing of COVID-19 curbs.,"sydney: australia's victoria state expects to announce a further easing of covid-19 restrictions this week, acting premier james merlino said on sunday (jun 13), as the state reported one new locally acquired infection for a second straight day. the latest infection was a close contact of a previously reported case and had already been quarantined, victoria's health department said. victoria recorded 92 cases in its latest wave of covid-19 infections, which triggered a two-week snap lockdown late last month.  the state emerged from the lockdown on friday as new cases declined, but some physical distancing rules remain. ""my expectation is by later in the week, we will be in a position to announce further easing of restrictions for regional victoria and . . .  for metropolitan melbourne,"" merlino said. merlino added he was keen to get people back to attending sporting events and theatre, though he had no announcement to make yet in that regard. under existing curbs, melbourne residents can only travel up to 25km from home while outdoor gatherings are limited to 10 people.  masks are required indoors and outdoors at all public spaces. more than 3,000 primary close contacts of infected cases are already in quarantine with about 122 exposure sites listed on the victorian government website. australia has fared much better than many other developed countries during the pandemic, with more than 22,300 local covid-19 cases and 910 deaths since march last year, mostly in victorian aged-care homes. snap lockdowns, internal border controls and tough social distancing rules have helped it contain prior outbreaks. new south wales and neighbouring queensland are on high alert after an infected woman and her husband travelled from victoria through several country towns in both states. with no new cases on sunday, new south wales has not reported any locally acquired infection in more than a month, while queensland last reported cases in late march. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

""the distribution of condoms is not for use at the athlete's village, but to have athletes take them back to their home countries to raise awareness"" of hiv and aids issues, said tokyo 2020 in an emailed response to questions by reuters. officials have already barred overseas spectators and are asking those who do attend the delayed event to show their support by clapping rather than cheering or singing to try and reduce the risk of spreading the virus. dining has become another issue to resolve.  organisers were originally planning to feed residents of the village in vast dining halls – the largest one with a capacity to seat 4,500 people at once. but now, the organisers will ask athletes to dine alone, maintain social distancing with others, and wipe down surfaces after eating. ""without the proper measures in place, it will only take one person to bring in the virus and spread it, especially in places like the athlete village,"" nobuhiko okabe, one of the infectious disease specialists advising tokyo 2020 on its coronavirus measures said at a news conference on friday. ""we have to do what we can to make sure an outbreak doesn't happen, and we really need the cooperation of all the athletes and delegations to make this work,"" he added.

2021-06-14,"G7 vows action on COVID-19 vaccines, climate change.","carbis bay, england: group of seven (g7) leaders on sunday (jun 13) vowed to start delivering 1 billion doses of covid-19 vaccines and to step up action on climate change, in a summit call to arms by a revived democratic alliance that also confronted china and russia. in a final communique issued at their first physical summit in nearly two years, the leaders of the elite club largely hewed to us president joe biden's push to regain the west's cohesion after the tumultuous era of his predecessor donald trump. ""we will harness the power of democracy, freedom, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights to answer the biggest questions and overcome the greatest challenges,"" the leaders said. but the pledge on vaccines for poorer nations fell drastically short of the 11 billion doses that campaigners say are needed to end a pandemic that has claimed nearly 4 million lives and wrecked economies around the globe. ""i'm afraid there will be smiles (at the g7) but they are not solutions,"" former british prime minister gordon brown told sky news, calling the summit ""an unforgivable moral failure"". ""millions of people will go unvaccinated and thousands of people i'm afraid will die,"" said brown, who helped coordinate international responses to the world's last major economic shock in 2008. likewise, the g7's pledges to deliver more aid for countries at the sharp end of climate change, and to phase out fossil fuel investments, were decried as too little, too late ahead of a un summit in november. ""the g7 have failed to set us up for a successful cop26 as trust is sorely lacking between rich and developing countries,"" said greenpeace international executive director jennifer morgan. ""we need authentic leadership and that means treating the pandemic and the climate crisis for what they are: an interconnected inequality emergency,"" she said. ""green industrial revolution""nevertheless, british prime minister boris johnson, the summit's host, said the g7 wanted to ""drive a global green industrial revolution to transform the way we live"". ""there is a direct relationship between reducing emissions, restoring nature, creating jobs and ensuring long-term economic growth,"" he said. johnson also touted a g7 pledge to get 40 million more girls into schools over the next five years, as part of the post-pandemic reconstruction. a white house official agreed the three-day gathering in cornwall, southwest england, had been an ""unusually substantive and productive g7"". angela merkel, attending her last g7 as german chancellor, said biden had brought ""new momentum"" to efforts to tackle the world's problems. india and south africa, who took part in the g7 talks as guests, had pressed for the gathering to waive intellectual property rights on western vaccines.  but britain and germany were notable holdouts on that. campaigners also complained the g7 had failed to flesh out how it will pay for a newly agreed ""nature compact"" to protect 30 per cent of the world's land and oceans from despoliation by 2030. the leaders committed to nearly halve their carbon emissions by 2030, relative to 2010, and to phase out the use of ""unabated coal"" fuel whose emissions have not gone through any filtering ""as soon as possible"". they vowed to end most government support for the fossil fuel sector overseas, and to phase out petrol and diesel cars. the g7 had sharp words for beijing and moscow, in the build-up to a nato summit in brussels on monday and biden's first sit-down with russian president vladimir putin in switzerland on wednesday. they demanded china end abuses including forced labour in xinjiang, where activists say up to 1 million people from uyghur and other muslim minorities are interned in camps, and in hong kong. and they pressed china to let experts from the world health organization (who) investigate further how covid-19 first emerged, amid suspicions that the coronavirus may have escaped from a chinese laboratory. the allies adopted a us initiative to counter china in infrastructure funding for poorer nations, promising to ""collectively catalyse"" hundreds of billions of investment. thebuild back better world (b3w)project is aimed squarely at competing with beijing's trillion-dollar belt and road infrastructure initiative, which has been widely criticised for saddling small countries with unmanageable debt. and the g7 demanded that russia ""credibly explain"" the use of chemical agents on its soil, end its ""systematic crackdown"" on opposition groups and media, and ""hold to account"" criminals waging ransomware attacks. royal blessinga lingering row between britain and the european union over post-brexit trading arrangements in northern ireland hung over the talks. but london sought to bring all sides together using the ""soft power"" diplomacy of queen elizabeth ii and her heir prince charles, at a friday night reception for leaders and eu chiefs. joined on saturday by counterparts from australia, south africa and south korea with india also taking part remotely they then enjoyed an evening beach barbecue around fire pits, featuring a sea shanty band and toasted marshmallows. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

largely hewed to us president joe biden's push to regain the west's cohesion after the tumultuous era of his predecessor donald trump."", '""we will harness the power of democracy, freedom, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights to answer the biggest questions and overcome the greatest challenges,"" the leaders said.', 'but the pledge on vaccines for poorer nations fell drastically short of the 11 billion doses that campaigners say are needed to end a pandemic that has claimed nearly 4 million lives and wrecked economies around the globe.', '""i\'m afraid there will be smiles (at the g7) but they are not solutions,"" former british prime minister gordon brown told sky news, calling the summit ""an unforgivable moral failure"".', '""millions of people will go unvaccinated and thousands of people i\'m afraid will die,"" said brown, who helped coordinate international responses to the world\'s last major economic shock in 2008. likewise, the g7\'s pledges to deliver more aid for countries at the sharp end of climate change, and to phase out fossil fuel investments, were decried as too little, too late ahead of a un summit in november.', '""the g7 have failed to set us up for a successful cop26 as trust is sorely lacking between rich and developing countries,"" said greenpeace international executive director jennifer morgan.', '""we need authentic leadership and that means treating the pandemic and the climate crisis for what they are: an interconnected inequality emergency,"" she said.', '""green industrial revolution""nevertheless, british prime minister

out how it will pay for a newly agreed ""nature compact"" to protect 30 per cent of the world\'s land and oceans from despoliation by 2030. the leaders committed to nearly halve their carbon emissions by 2030, relative to 2010, and to phase out the use of ""unabated coal"" fuel whose emissions have not gone through any filtering ""as soon as possible"".', 'they vowed to end most government support for the fossil fuel sector overseas, and to phase out petrol and diesel cars.', ""the g7 had sharp words for beijing and moscow, in the build-up to a nato summit in brussels on monday and biden's

serbia's novak djokovic celebrates with the trophy after winning the french open against greece's stefanos tsitsipas at roland garros, paris june 13, 2021.  — reuters pic

follow us on instagram and subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates. paris, june 14 — for the second time in six years novak djokovic is halfway to a calendar year sweep of all four grand slam titles after winning the french open for a second time on sunday. the 34-year-old dug deep into his reserves of resilience to hit back from two sets down against greece's stefanos tsitsipas to win 6-7(6) 2-6 6-3 6-2 6-4 and increase his grand slam tally to 19. that takes him only one behind the men's record 20 held by rafa nadal and roger federer and there is nothing to suggest the world number one will not surpass his two career rivals. he can already claim something neither of those two can, after his win over the 22-year-old tsitsipas made him the first player in the professional era to win each of the four grand slams at least twice. having already claimed the australian open this year, he has a shot at becoming the first man to win all four majors in the same year since rod laver in 1969 and he could even complete a 'golden slam' by adding the olympic title in tokyo. ""everything is possible,"" djokovic told reporters. ""i've achieved some things that a lot of people thought it would be not possible for me to achieve.  everything is possible, and i did put myself in a good position to go for the golden slam.  but, you know, i was in this position in 2016 as well. ""it ended up in a third-round loss in wimbledon. ""wimbledon returns later this month after last year's tournament was cancelled because of the pandemic. djokovic won it in 2019 and will be the favourite to add a sixth title on the grass, after which he will turn his thoughts to the olympic games and the us open. ""obviously i will enjoy this win and then think about wimbledon in a few days' time.  i don't have an issue to say that i'm going for the title in wimbledon,"" he said. ""of course i am.  i won in '18 and '19 there.  hopefully i can keep that run going. ""as far as chasing down federer and nadal, djokovic said he has always considered it a possibility despite the fact that when he won his second grand slam title at the 2011 australian open, nadal had nine and federer was on 16. ""i never thought it was a mission impossible to reach the grand slams of these guys,"" djokovic said.  ""i mean, i'm not there, but it's one less.  but they are still playing. ""obviously they're playing great, especially rafa with his level.  we all have still opportunities at wimbledon, all the other slams.  i'll keep on going.  i'll keep on chasing.  at the same time i'll keep on paving my own path. ""his long-time coach marian vajda joked after sunday's comeback win that he and goran ivanisevic, who is also part of the team, would retire if djokovic won the calendar slam. ""i think it is possible, much more possible.  he loves to play in wimbledon and us open,"" he told reporters.  ""as much as novak is healthy, and he's healthy right now, he's in great shape, i think he has ability to win the grand slam for this year.  i'm pretty sure. ""it did not look likely when djokovic trailed by two sets against an inspired tsitsipas on sunday — the effort of beating nadal in a seismic semi-final appearing to catch up on him. but djokovic said some words of wisdom from a young fan helped him out. ""i don't know the boy.  he was in my ear the entire match basically, especially when i was two sets to love down.  he was encouraging me.  he was actually giving me tactics,"" djokovic, who presented the excited fan with his racket at the end, said. ""he was like, 'hold your serve, get an easy first ball, then dictate, go to his backhand'.  he was coaching me literally.  i found that very cute, very nice.

2021-06-14,Shannon Deery: Life in Victoria must continue as Covid spot fires emerge.,"we're in a position to experiment with methods other than lockdown to stop covid's spread — but it will take courage from authorities. another lockdown done and dusted.  there must be no more, except in the most desperate of circumstances. the devastating social impacts and dire economic consequences of forcing businesses to close, stopping kids going to school, keeping people locked in their homes and keeping family and friends apart, are now only too well known. after four lockdowns we might know what to expect, but that doesn't make it any easier. kids helpline recorded a 184 per cent increase in youth suicide attempts in victoria from december 2020 to may 2021 compared to one year earlier. reasons for the surge included ""the impact of isolation and lockdowns"" and the ""increased stress"" of young people not being at school.  consequently, there has been an increase in young people trying to access community-based mental health services. this was recognised by the state government last week with the immediate injection of $10m into critical mental health services. after a record $3. 8bn investment in mental health announced in last month's budget, the extra $10m is small money.  but it is recognition that critical services need funding right now. the government is no doubt feeling justified in locking victorians up for a fourth time. modelling by the burnet institute, released last week, found that without the action up to 2000 victorians would have contracted covid-19 by august. there can be no arguing the lockdown worked.  of course it did.  when people can't mix, the virus can't spread.  but there must be another way.  how can it be that after more than 15 months we're no more advanced at dealing with this virus? fortunately, unlike so many countries around the world still dealing with uncontrollable levels of the virus, victoria is not in that position.  just two cases were discovered after more than 80 days of no locally acquired transmissions.  which leaves us in the unique position to be bold with our approach, and experiment with methods that don't force the state to grind to a halt.  but it will take courage from authorities to let life continue while putting out the spot fires that will no doubt continue to emerge. victorian members of the committees for cities and regions are now calling on the state government to develop a long-term covid readiness plan.  they rightly point out staged restrictions and recovery road maps are too often inconsistently applied. ""this unpredictability of government decision-making contributes to the general unease in the community about unforeseeable restrictions that could be imposed upon victorians at any moment,"" they say. ""the lack of a clear and consistent approach to reopening and locking down victorian communities erodes business and consumer confidence to plan, resulting in damaging effects to local economies, community mental health outcomes and the reputation of victoria as the place to be. ""among other things they want ""a common set of publicly available and industry-informed standards to be applied to decision-making on covid restrictions in victoria. ""the government has long kept the rationale behind its decision-making process secret, saying only it is based on ""public health advice"". but increased transparency over the process will not only instil confidence, but could prompt a public debate about how to move forward.  and how to do so without another lockdown. it beggars belief that four days after wild storms lashed parts of the state, tens of thousands of victorians remain in the dark. more than 250,000 homes in storm damaged areas lost power last thursday.  thousands were last night still waiting for the lights to come back on.  in the middle of winter and with ongoing covid-19 restrictions in place, they've sat for days with no power, no lighting and for many, no heating. the net of blame could be cast far and wide.  but ultimately, this is an act of god and the blame game serves little purpose. what is hard to fathom is the virtual radio silence over the issue. the fact that hundreds of thousands of people were left without power, lights and heating is nothing short of a disaster. but the pandemic is all consuming.  the morning after the storms acting premier james merlino fronted the media to announce an easing of restrictions.  there was reference to the storms, but not much of substance. energy minister lily d'ambrosio put out a series of tweets, and thanked energy companies for their efforts in restoring services to normal. in normal times, it's hard to imagine ms d'ambrosio not fronting the media at least once, but probably multiple times, to update the community and instil a sense of confidence. it begs the question: with such intense government focus on covid, what else is being ignored, or given less attention than it deserves?carrying on the business of government alongside a pandemic response has been a problem for governments the world over.  taxpayers should be concerned about the reintroduction of the virus, particularly through government error. because every time covid-19 returns through a hotel quarantine breach or similar failure by authorities, the government is forced to again turn all attention to eliminating the scourge.  and that can only be to the detriment of other critical functions.  — shannon deery is herald sun state politics editorshannon deery is the herald sun's state political editor.  he joined the paper in 2007 and covered courts and crime before joining the politics team in 2020. to join the conversation, please

will take courage from authorities."", 'another lockdown done and dusted.', 'there must be no more, except in the most desperate of circumstances.', 'the devastating social impacts and dire economic consequences of forcing businesses to close, stopping kids going to school, keeping people locked in their homes and keeping family and friends apart, are now only too well known.', ""after four lockdowns we might know what to expect, but that doesn't make it any easier."", 'kids helpline recorded a 184 per cent increase in youth suicide attempts in victoria from december 2020 to may 2021 compared to one year earlier.', 'reasons for the surge included ""the impact of isolation and lockdowns"" and the ""increased stress"" of young people not being at school.', 'consequently, there has been an increase in young people trying to access community-based mental health services.', 'this was recognised by the state government last week with the immediate injection of $10m into critical mental health services.', 'after a record $3.', ""8bn investment in mental health announced in last month's budget, the extra $10m is small money."", 'but it is recognition that critical services need funding right now.', 'the government is no doubt feeling justified in locking victorians up for a fourth time.', 'modelling by the burnet institute, released last week, found that without the action up to 2000 victorians would have contracted covid-19 by august.', 'there can be no arguing the lockdown worked.', 'of course it did.', ""when people can't mix, the virus can't spread."", 'but there must be another way.', ""how can it be that after more than 15 months we're no more advanced at dealing with this virus?"", 'fortunately, unlike so many countries around the world still dealing with uncontrollable levels of the virus, victoria is not in that position.', 'just two cases were discovered after more than 80 days of no locally acquired transmissions.', ""which leaves us in the unique position to be bold with our approach, and experiment with methods that don't force the state to grind to a halt."", 'but it will take courage from authorities to let life continue while putting out the spot fires that will no doubt continue to emerge.', 'victorian members of the committees for cities and regions are now calling on the state government to develop a long-term covid readiness plan.', 'they rightly point out staged restrictions and recovery road maps are too often inconsistently applied.', '""this unpredictability of government decision-making contributes to the general unease in the community about unforeseeable restrictions that could be imposed upon victorians at any moment,"" they say.', '""the lack of a clear and consistent approach to reopening and locking down victorian communities erodes business and consumer confidence to plan, resulting in damaging effects to local economies, community mental health outcomes and the reputation of victoria as the place to be.', '""among other things they want ""a common set of publicly available and industry-informed standards to be applied to decision-making on covid restrictions in victoria.', '""the government has long kept the rationale behind its decision-making process secret, saying only it is based on ""public health advice"".', 'but increased transparency over the process will not only instil confidence, but could prompt a public debate about how to move forward.', 'and how to do so without another lockdown.', 'it beggars belief that four days after wild storms lashed parts of the state, tens of thousands of victorians remain in the dark.', 'more than 250,000 homes in storm damaged areas lost power last thursday.', 'thousands were last night still waiting for the lights to come back on.', ""in the middle of winter and with ongoing covid-19 restrictions in place, they've sat for days with no power, no lighting and for many, no heating."", 'the net of blame could be cast far and wide.', 'but ultimately, this is an act of god and the blame game serves little purpose.', 'what is hard to fathom is the virtual radio silence over the issue.', 'the fact that hundreds of thousands of people were left without power, lights and heating is nothing short of a disaster.', 'but the pandemic is all consuming.', 'the morning after the storms acting premier james merlino fronted the media to announce an easing of restrictions.', 'there was reference to the storms, but not much of substance.', ""energy minister lily d'ambrosio put out a series of tweets, and thanked energy companies for their efforts in restoring services to normal."", ""in normal times, it's hard to imagine ms d'ambrosio not fronting the media at least once, but probably multiple times, to update the community and instil a sense of confidence."", 'it begs the question: with such intense government focus on covid, what else is being ignored, or given less attention than it deserves?carrying on the business of government alongside a pandemic response has been a problem for governments the world over.', 'taxpayers should be concerned about the reintroduction of the virus, particularly through government error.', 'because every time covid-19 returns through a hotel quarantine breach or similar failure by authorities, the government is forced to again turn all attention to eliminating the scourge.', 'and that can only be to the detriment of other critical functions.', ""— shannon deery is herald sun state politics editorshannon deery is the herald sun's state political editor."", 'he joined the

2021-06-14,Football: Sterling gives England opening Euro 2020 win over Croatia.,"london: raheem sterling finally found his tournament touch when his 61st-minute goal gave england a deserved 1-0 win over croatia at wembley on sunday (jun 13) as they began a european championship with a victory for the first time in nine attempts. sterling, something of a surprise starter after a flat end to the domestic season but a favourite of manager gareth southgate, slid home after great work by kalvin phillips to end an individual drought that had run through england's three previous major tournaments. ""it feels good.  i grew up two minutes down the road, so i knew i had to score here, and it was a great feeling to do it,"" said the wembley-raised forward. southgate said he was unaware of england's previous run of opening-game failures despite having played in one of them in 1996 but, as expected, was not getting carried away by a solid but unexceptional display. ""it's for everybody else to get excited and throw their beer around and do whatever they want,"" he said.  ""it's brilliant to give that joy to people.  but for us, it's on to the next one and preparing for a really tough game on friday (against scotland). ""but i was really pleased with the way we settled so quickly.  big occasion, sweltering hot day, every reason to look nervous at the start, but we didn't.  with and without the ball, we were composed.  although it was always going to be a game of few clear chances, we looked the bigger threat throughout. ""the game lacked the jeopardy of the teams' 2018 world cup semi-final, won by croatia, and losing on sunday was no disaster for them given the way the draw pans out, but it was a morale-boosting victory for england as they set off once again in search of their first title since 1966. pace flaggedroared on by a noisy 22,500 crowd a quarter of wembley's capacity they started full of bright intentions and put huge pressure on the visitors. phil foden, his bleached hair channelling paul gascoigne from euro 96, almost gave them a dream start when he cut in from the right and curled a low shot against a post. phillips, impressive all afternoon, then had a 25-yard shot blocked but, instead of riding the early momentum, england lost their way and, with the sun beating down, the pace and energy seeped out of the game either side of the break. england eventually shook themselves out of the torpor and struck when phillips drove through the retreating defence, rode two tackles and played the ball expertly into the path of the darting sterling who, under pressure, just got enough on the ball to steer it home. sterling had looked lively all day and celebrated his first major tournament goal with gusto, though he should have added a second 13 minutes later but blazed wildly over the bar. another bright spot for england was the introduction of substitute jude bellingham who, at 17 years and 349 days, became the youngest player to appear in the european championship finals. croatia also threw on their attacking subs as they tried to show a bit more ambition but though england's defence looked a little shaky at times there were few chances for an equalizer as, conversely to england, they lost their opening euro match for the first time in their six tournaments. ""we didn't do enough up front and couldn't engineer our trademark fast-flowing moves, but i am optimistic that we'll improve and get it right in the next two games,"" said coach zlatko dalic. they are against scotland and the czech republic, who meet on monday, with croatia playing the czechs in glasgow on friday. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

""they understand the challenge, the need for many of the adjustments that they have to make.  there is a certain optimism, that we can get through this. ""asked if there could be more financial support for the sector, mr iswaran said the government remains committed to help, but any aid will be based on an assessment of the situation going forward. responding to queries, cag also said tenants in airport terminals will continue to have their rental fees waived until they are allowed to reopen. jewel changi airport will open from monday, but the terminals will stay closed to the public for now to give the staff some time to get used to the new measures. mr iswaran said the change in operations at the airport is a major one.  ""when we talk about the changi experience, what it means is travellers from all over the world coming, and in fact, mingling as they experience changi,"" he added. ""now, we want to segment the passengers.  we are taking a much more calibrated approach.

""deep cleaning and disinfection of changi airport's passenger terminal buildings and jewel changi airport have been completed,"" the civil aviation authority of singapore and changi airport group said yesterday.  ""(they) are on track to reopen safely and progressively. ""passenger terminal buildings remain closed to the public, however, and jewel's reopening is only the first of a phased process, with airport operations having undergone significant changes, including the segregation of about 14,000 airport workers into different risk zones. this is to minimise the transmission risks revealed by the t3 cluster, which began at the arrival halls and baggage claim areas, where staff came into contact with passengers. the cluster spawned 108 cases, 43 of whom were airport workers. staff working in the highest-risk areas will have to wear personal protective equipment at all times, except when they are eating or resting.  inbound and outbound passengers will also no longer have opportunities to intermingle. increased testing will become part and parcel of working life for some airport employees. since may 23, those in higher-risk roles have had to take an additional antigen rapid test between a seven-day routine polymerase chain reaction test. some are now taking covid-19 breath tests as part of a small-scale pilot, with the airport authorities hoping that routine testing will be quicker and more comfortable for airport workers. the disposable traciex breathalyser, which has just been approved by the health sciences authority, is non-invasive, has been shown by trials to be almost as accurate as the pcr test, and can generate results within two minutes. it may eventually replace the antigen rapid tests for workers. minister for transport s.  iswaran, who visited t3 yesterday, said the breathalyser could be a game changer, but still urged caution. ""we are using this opportunity to administer the trial in the airport, and we will continue to scale it up so that there is more data,"" he said.  ""in the first instance, it is promising, but we need to do a lot of work, and i think the testing will continue and gather pace as we go forward. ""asked about the transport ministry's strategy for reopening borders, mr iswaran said it depends on circumstances here and in the countries singapore is engaging. in singapore, factors to consider include how extensively and quickly the population is vaccinated, how widely available tests and testing facilities are, and if tracing of new cases remains effective. the operations at changi airport as a point of entry are also critical, he said, and the airport authorities have fundamentally re-examined operations in the last few weeks. he said singapore is in conversation with ""many potential partners"", including south korea, and that both hong kong and singapore remain fully committed to resuming their air travel bubble. ""right now, our engagement with all our partners has been on the various preparatory elements whether vaccination, testing or other kinds of protocols.  when the conditions are right, then we will be able to mobilise,"" he said. see the big storyjoin st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-14,"Macron and Johnson clash over Northern Ireland, as Brexit tensions rise at G7.","carbis bay, england: growing tensions between britain and the european union threatened to overshadow the group of seven summit's conclusion on sunday (jun 13), with london accusing france of ""offensive"" remarks that northern ireland was not part of the united kingdom. ever since the united kingdom voted to leave the european union in 2016, the two sides have been trying to work out how to deal with post-brexit trade and the british province, which has a land border with eu member ireland. ultimately, the talks keep coming back to the delicate patchwork of history, nationalism, religion and geography that intertwine in northern ireland, but the latest spat over the brexit divorce deal is centred on sausages. during talks with emmanuel macron at the g7 summit, british prime minister johnson queried how the french president would react if toulouse sausages could not be sold in paris markets, echoing london's accusation that the eu is preventing sales of british chilled meats in northern ireland. british media reported that macron responded by inaccurately saying northern ireland was not part of the united kingdom, remarks british foreign minister dominic raab described as ""offensive"". ""various eu figures here in carbis bay, but frankly for months now and years, have characterised northern ireland as somehow a separate country and that is wrong,"" raab said.

2021-06-14,New Zealand's Ardern pans Christchurch mosque attacks film amid backlash.,"wellington: new zealand prime minister jacinda ardern on monday (jun 14) criticiseda planned movieabout her response to the 2019 christchurch mosque attacks as poorly timed and focussed on the wrong subject. the us-backed film they are us has sparked an intense backlash among new zealand muslims, with community leaders slamming the project for pushing a ""white saviour"" narrative. ardern said the attacks when a white supremacist gunman ran amok at two mosques during friday prayers, killing 51 and seriously injuring another 40 remained ""very raw"" for many new zealanders. she said filmmakers had not consulted her about the movie, which is set to star australia's rose byrne as the centre-left leader. ""in my view, which is a personal view, it feels very soon and very raw for new zealand,"" ardern told tvnz. ""and while there are so many stories that should be told at some point, i don't consider mine to be one of them they are the community's stories, the families' stories. ""ardern won widespread praise for her empathetic and inclusive handling of the attacks, the worst mass shooting in modern new zealand history, including wearing a scarf when meeting mourners. the movie's title references a line from a speech she gave in the immediate aftermath of the atrocity when she pledged to support the muslim community and tighten gun laws. a petition from the national islamic youth association calling for the production to be shut down has gathered more than 58,000 signatures. the association said the proposed film ""sidelines the victims and survivors and instead centres the response of a white woman"". it said the muslim community had not been properly consulted about the project, which has been scripted by new zealand writer andrew niccol. ""entities and individuals should not seek to commercialise or profit from a tragedy that befell our community, neither should such an atrocity be sensationalised"", association co-chair haris murtaza said. muslim poet mohamed hassan said the filmmakers needed to focus on members of the community that bore the brunt of the attacks, not use them as props in a feel-good story about ardern. ""you do not get to tell this story.  you do not get to turn this into a white saviour narrative.  this is not yours,"" he tweeted. the attacker, australian self-declared white supremacist brenton tarrant, was jailed for life without parole last year, the first time a whole-of-life term has been imposed in new zealand. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

															reutersst petersburg: romelu lukaku struck twice as belgium confirmed their status as one of the favourites for euro 2020 with a confident 3-0 victory over russia on saturday. despite being without key performer kevin de bruyne, world number one ranked belgium were rarely in trouble against a russia side that struggled to impose themselves. roberto martinez's belgium top group b on three points, ahead on goal difference of finland who beat denmark in the group's other game in copenhagen. the red devils are unbeaten in 10 games in all competitions and have suffered just one defeat in their last 24 outings.  they have also scored in each of their last 31 games. the visitor's grabbed the lead in the 10th minute when andrei semyonov failed to deal with a ball into the box from leander dendoncker, and lukaku turned and fired into the bottom corner. lukaku celebrated his goal by running to the television camera and shouting ""chris, chris, i love you"" in tribute to christian eriksen, the danish midfielder and his club team-mate at inter milan, who had been rushed to hospital after collapsing during the earlier game in the group. belgium were calm in possession and finding plenty of time and space against a russia side who struggled to get a firm grip on the game. the russians reached the quarter-finals in the world cup they hosted in 2018 but the energy of those performances was missing, despite playing at home in front of more than 26,000 fans. stanislav cherchesov struggled to find either the tempo to their attacks or a way to provide quality service to striker artem dzyuba who was too often left isolated. it was no surprise when the second goal came, in the 34th minute, when russia keeper anton shunin could only parry thorgan hazard's shot towards thomas meunier, who made no mistake. russia applied some pressure after the interval but the beligans coped without too much panic and the game already felt decided before lukaku wrapped up the win with a well-taken effort after racing on to a through ball from meunier. lukaku said the eriksen situation had left him in tears before the game. ""i cried a lot because i was scared, obviously.  you live strong moments together.  i spent more time with him than with my family,"" he said. ""my thoughts are with him, his girlfriend, his two kids and his family,"" he added. ""i enjoyed the game but for me, it was difficult to play because my mind was with christian.  i hope he is healthy and i dedicate this performance to him,"" added the former manchester united striker. cherchesov conceded his team had struggled after falling behind to lukaku's opener. ""our tournament is continuing.  we are doing our job.  we chose our system, it worked partly but then started to break down.  the belgians scored and then it was difficult to get the ball off them. ""the russians host finland on wednesday and will need to quickly get their campaign on track. ""we will get out of the situation.  we put ourselves there, so we must now get out of it,"" cherchesov added. lukaku and the belgian team had taken the knee before the kick-off but the anti-racist gesture was met with jeers and whistles from the crowd. phuket: a hospital ambulance crashed off the road during a storm in the small hours of monday in muang district.  the driver and two nurses escaped with only minor injuries. ayutthaya: eighteen employees of phra nakhon si ayutthaya hospital were found to be infected with covid-19 but the situation was under control and it remains open, hospital director chokchai leetho-chawalit said. wellington: polynesian seafarers likely reached antarctica hundreds of years before the western explorers usually credited with discovering the frozen continent, a new study has concluded.

2021-06-14,"UK, EU show little sign of defusing post-Brexit row.","carbis bay: britain and the european union showed little sign of defusing a post-brexit trade dispute on saturday (jun 12), with both sides repeating their opposing positions even after us president joe biden encouraged them to find a compromise. since britain completed its exit from the eu late last year, relations between the two have soured, with both accusing the other of acting in bad faith over part of their brexit divorce deal that covers border issues with northern ireland. at a group of seven summit in southwestern england, a meeting of the world's largest advanced economies, prime minister boris johnson held talks with french president emmanuel macron, german chancellor angela merkel and top eu officials ursula von der leyen and charles michel. the eu told london once again that it must implement the brexit deal in full and introduce checks on certain goods moving from britain to its province of northern ireland.  britain again called for urgent and innovative solutions within the part of the deal called the northern ireland protocol. ""both sides must implement what we agreed on,"" von der leyen, european commission president, said after meeting johnson alongside michel, the european council president. ""there is complete eu unity on this,"" she said, adding that the deal had been agreed, signed and ratified by both johnson's government and the bloc. johnson's spokesman responded: ""the pm (prime minister) in all cases (expressed) confidence in the uk's position as regards to the northern ireland protocol and the desire for pragmatism and compromise on all sides. ""although there was no sign of a narrowing of positions, the threats of last week over the so-called ""sausage wars"" were absent.  an eu official said there was a feeling the rhetoric needed to be toned down. since britain exited the bloc's orbit, johnson has unilaterally delayed the implementation of some provisions of the protocol, including checks on chilled foods such as sausages moving from the mainland to northern ireland, saying it was causing disruption to some supplies to the british province. the united states has expressed grave concern the dispute could undermine the 1998 good friday peace deal. that agreement largely brought an end to the ""troubles"" three decades of conflict between irish catholic nationalist militants and pro-british protestant ""loyalist"" paramilitaries in which 3,600 people were killed. brexitthough brexit was not part of the formal agenda for the g7 summit in the english seaside resort of carbis bay, it has more than once threatened to cloud the meeting. france's macron offered to reset relations with britain as long as johnson stood by the brexit deal a characterisation of the meeting that was rejected by the british team. brexit has strained the situation in northern ireland.  the province has an open border with eu member ireland so the northern ireland protocol was agreed as a way to preserve the bloc's single market after britain left. the protocol essentially kept the province in the eu's customs union and adhering to many of the single market rules, creating a regulatory border in the irish sea between the british province and the rest of the united kingdom. london says the protocol is unsustainable in its current form because of the disruption to some goods supplies. the pro-british ""unionist"" community in northern ireland say they are now split off from the rest of the united kingdom and the brexit deal breaches the 1998 peace deal.  but the open border between the province and ireland was a key principle of good friday deal. biden, who is proud of his irish heritage, has made clear that any steps that imperilled the peace agreement would not be welcomed by washington. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

as of june 9, singapore has vaccinated around 44 per cent of its population with at least one dose of the pfizer-biontech or moderna vaccines.  three in four seniors above 60 have had their jabs or booked an appointment.  ― photo by ili nadhirah mansor fo

follow us on instagram and subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates. singapore, june 12 — mr jake goh, 51, a principal of a privately-run pre-school, does not mind it when people label him as a conspiracy theorist or an anti-vaccine advocate. ""whether i am a conspiracy theorist or not, time will tell.  i'm not trying to argue with people, i'm just here to offer an alternative view.  if they decide to let their children be jabbed, i can only warn them,"" said mr goh. he is an admistrator of two telegram groups that discuss covid-19 and vaccine injuries, each with thousands of members surfacing claims that the two authorised vaccines here — pfizer-biontech and moderna — have caused serious side effects such as stroke. this is despite the fact that the singapore government has authorised the pfizer-biontech vaccine for teens aged 12 to 15, with an expert committee and the health sciences authority (hsa) assessing that the vaccine is safe and efficacious to use for this group. ""you can gather a lot of knowledge from the internet.  not everything the doctor says about vaccines is correct,"" said mr goh. mr goh was not always so radical, having dutifully received flu jabs and other types of vaccines in the past.  his transformation to become an anti-vaccine advocate began last year during the pandemic, after reading articles about the drug industrial complex behind cholesterol research. nowadays, he gets his information from youtubers who discuss health issues and have a wide following, as well as from health journals that he reads to ""get to the source"" directly.   after all, newspapers can be biased, he claimed. his contrarian views have led to conflicts with people around him.  his best friends removed him from their facebook friends list because his anti-vaccine posts have become ""too extreme"" lately. his sister, who lives in france where some 110,000 people have died from covid-19, often chides him for telling others not to get the jab when he has not seen firsthand how horrific the disease can become outside of singapore. but he is immovable in his radical belief that a good vaccine is not available because their development is rushed: ""people say i believe in conspiracy theories, that i am an anti-vaxxer, that i am crazy.  oh yes, i get that a lot. ""mr goh is not the only one who has been socially distanced this way during the pandemic. artist zelda, 34, has also seen her family ties and long-standing relationships strained or severed, as a result of her wild and unsubstantiated claims — such as one proclaiming that vaccines are part of a money-grubbing conspiracy by the ""global public health mafia"". first, it was with her father, who reads the newspapers and has been vaccinated, and whom she often had heated arguments with. to her, official narratives from governments and experts obscure the truth, while alternative viewpoints from youtube commentators deserve to be heard. then, the fallout also spread to her close friends, whom she has known for decades, after she began sharing articles depicting covid-19 as a lab-made bioweapon, and defending these articles when her friends challenged her. sick of arguing whenever zelda shares articles about such theories on their mutual chat groups, some of her childhood friends have since shut her out of their lives.  she declined to give her full name. wistfully, one of these friends told today: ""she was always the first one to diffuse an argument.  but now she believes so much in this that she's willing to just abandon friends over it. ""speaking to today, zelda recounted how voicing out these ""alternative facts"" during the pandemic had caused people around her to blow a fuse. with her father, she no longer desires to discuss such theories at the dinner table.  ""we just say hello and good morning, that sort of thing.  it's much healthier this way. """"in this pandemic, it is quite sobering that the things that we believe in shape us, down to the relationships that we have,"" she added, referring to how she is no longer on talking terms with some of her friends. as singaporeans, and people elsewhere, suffer from an information overload regarding covid-19 — where fact, fiction and half-truths abound — it takes patience and effort to engage people with strongly held beliefs that are based on falsehoods, sid ms tin pei ling, member of parliament (mp) for macpherson. ""(they) could have good intentions too.  but if one shuts them out completely, it means there are no more chances to give them the right facts, and does not give you the opportunity to understand each other better,"" the chairperson of the government parliamentary committee for communications and information said. beyond that, misinformation about the virus has far more serious implications as it could waylay singapore's pandemic plans, experts said. as of june 9, singapore has vaccinated around 44 per cent of its population with at least one dose of the pfizer-biontech or moderna vaccines.  three in four seniors above 60 have had their jabs or booked an appointment. but along with this progress, the number of incidents involving misinformation has also increased lately, some noted. there have been three incidents about coronavirus-related falsehoods requiring the use of singapore's fake news law, the protection from online falsehoods and manipulation act (pofma), in the span of a month from april to may, noted mr ryan lim, founding partner of digital management consultancy qed consulting. on june 8, health minister ong ye kung acknowledged these issues playing out on social media that had cast doubt on the safety of covid-19 vaccines, claiming that mrna vaccines, such as pfizer's and moderna's, do not work. he was referring to a petition by 12 doctors, who had disagreed with the government's decision to roll out mrna vaccines, and also discouraged parents from vaccinating their children. eleven of the doctors later retracted their statement, and the authorities as well as a number of other infectious diseases experts were quick to respond to these vaccine claims. while the viral situation is under control in singapore presently, dr shashi jayakumar, head of s rajaratnam school of international studies' centre of excellence for national security (cens), warned that the covid-19 situation could very well turn critical again for singapore. and if it does, and if trust in the state and institutions is shaken as a result, malicious rumours, falsehoods, half-truths and misinformation would be back to plague singapore's pandemic response once again. ""we are starting from a good position now.  but hypothetically, if there is wave after wave of infections, and lockdowns after lockdowns are needed, that would be the fertile ground for malicious misinformation to proliferate,"" he said. fact, fiction and the unknowntracing the roots of misinformation to their sources would likely reveal one of several motivations behind its spread: these include political and ideological reasons, commercial profit, mischief, but also cases of genuine misunderstanding, said experts. qed's mr lim said: ""such false content tends to thrive in an environment with a high degree of anxiety and ambiguity.  the successful spread will create a vicious circle that encourages more of such content to be created. ""to date, pofma has been used in 14 separate instances concerning covid-19-related falsehoods. but the amount of misinformation being spread during the pandemic is far more numerous than those flagged by the fake news law, which on its own, is insufficient to stop people from believing these claims, said experts. associate professor alton chua from the wee kim wee school of communication and information at nanyang technological university said that while pofma is designed to nip the spread of falsehood in the bud, it is no silver bullet when it comes to shaping beliefs. people can also suffer from confirmation bias, choosing to interpret information in a way that conforms to their existing beliefs, he said.  that means that those who are sceptical about covid-19 vaccines, for example, tend to exaggerate reports they come across about post-vaccination complications.   ""the mindset of 'better be safe than sorry' is ironically what compels these people to share untruths,"" he said. fast-evolving pandemic conducive for misinformationwhen it comes to covid-19, however, the scientific nature of the coronavirus and vaccines renders it hard for people to make their own conclusions about the science.  thus, it is key that people can turn to experts with the right credentials and experience to help them sort fact from fiction. what makes this pandemic a perfect storm for misinformation to be reinforced and spread is because it concerns a new virus, fast-emerging viral strains, and cutting-edge vaccines that will take time to fully understand them. and with science still playing catch-up with an evolving disease, there is a danger that misinformation can fill in the void and could even foster mistrust of scientific methods. dr carol soon and mr shawn goh from the institute of policy studies (ips) at the lee kuan yew school of public policy said that a study they conducted last year had found that false information relating to health and medicine was second out of 11 topics that were most frequently believed by singaporeans. falsehoods about international and foreign affairs came out tops in the study. falsehoods on vaccine safetydr soon and mr goh warned that they have observed increasingly active forms of ""online mobilisation"" among people who circulate unverified information or mistruths about covid-19 vaccine safety and its purported side effects. the ips researchers observed that people have been setting up facebook groups to share misinformation, and creating google forms to solicit stories and cases of vaccine injuries, often without the full context. ""mobilisation is also taking place in closed-group platforms such as whatsapp and telegram.  the end-to-end encryption technology that undergirds instant messaging apps hinders timely misinformation detection and debunking,"" they said. mr jake goh, who runs one such group on telegram, claimed that its purpose is to create awareness because ""transparency is needed in public health"", so that the public can make an informed decision about vaccines. ""we are filling the gap that the ministry of health and all the relevant authorities are not providing or not announcing,"" he said. he claimed that his vaccine scepticism is backed by his own research into the clinical trial data of existing vaccines. the hsa reported in may that out of the 3. 7 million vaccine doses administered until may 23, there were 157 reports of serious adverse effects such as anaphylaxis, but no deaths have been linked to the vaccines so far. on this, ips' dr soon and mr shawn goh said that it is often the case that those who go the extra mile to look up information on vaccine efficacy may end up reinforcing their own beliefs. ""their false beliefs may be reinforced when they draw invalid conclusions from scientific studies without a full appreciation of their robustness, or if they turn to 'scientific journals' that are not actually recognised by the expert community,"" they said. referring to these online mobilisation efforts, dr soon and mr shawn goh added: ""without intervention, these online spaces allow anti-vaccine views to fester and gain perceived legitimacy as they grow in size. ""establishing links between vaccines and deaths: what public needs to understandexperts stressed the importance in trusting the scientific method — that conclusions can only be reached after observations, experiments and measurements are done. professor teo yik ying, dean of the saw swee hock school of public health, said that there is a clear difference between proof of absence and the absence of proof. it is one thing to issue a statement such as ""in all the participants in the clinical trials, we have not observed a death event"", as opposed to ""this vaccine does not cause death in anyone who takes it"", he said. ""there is a need to systematically review the evidence of any mortality event that is suspected to be linked to the vaccine to understand whether taking the vaccine caused the fatality,"" he added. because proper science takes time, it thus falls to a close partnership among responsible scientists, responsible media and trusted public agencies to be agile in responding to fake news in the meantime, he said. all three parties are essential to this effort, since no single stakeholder holds all the cards needed to combat fake news. the media and fact-checking organisations, for example, do not have the complete information needed to deal with complex scientific problems, but they should have access to trusted experts and policymakers to distill the information for the public. this also means people should be wary of scientists who are not properly informed themselves, as well as irresponsible ones who could have been generating and spreading misinformation, said prof teo. orchestrated disinformation campaignsanother aspect of misinformation concerns the threat of state-led disinformation campaigns, in the light of efforts by some countries to promote ""vaccine diplomacy"". china, for example, is donating vaccines to regions where its competition with the us for influence is intense, reported reuters news agency.  the us has also announced its plans to donate 500 million doses of vaccines to the developing world, including in asia. but could vaccine diplomacy also take on a more aggressive stance, such as by resorting to disinformation campaigns to discredit another country's vaccine? are such efforts already underway in singapore?it is possible, though drawing a link between a falsehood and a state-originated disinformation campaign is difficult, said ms dymples leong, a senior analyst at cens. she noted that there has been misinformation revolving not just around vaccines in general, but also certain vaccines in particular. asked whether vaccine geopolitics are at play in singapore, cens' dr jayakumar said there is no doubt that vaccine diplomacy is now an important ""calling card"" of national soft power, so there are tensions whenever that soft power is being undermined. he said that messages of indeterminate origin have been bandied around on social media creating fear about certain vaccine types, though he agreed with ms leong that it is not easy to conclude that these are state-led efforts. nevertheless, singapore is also being closely watched for what vaccines it buys and uses for its national vaccination programme, he added. ""it is universally recognised that when we choose certain vaccines, questions may be asked as to why we did not choose another one,"" said dr jayakumar.

greater transparency, engagement the antidote?with such a wide spectrum of motivations behind the spread of misinformation, tackling pandemic falsehoods is a challenging task for any government, said experts. singapore cannot ignore malicious falsehoods, lest they take hold in society, said those interviewed. ms tin, the macpherson mp, told today: ""the government is faced with the responsibility to contain and control the virus in the fastest time possible to reduce the damage to our people to the minimum possible. ""after all, at the national level, if there are people who are spreading misinformation, discouraging people from receiving the vaccination or from complying with the safety rules, then you can imagine how much it will slow down our pandemic response or even derail it. ""fortunately, singapore is not faring too bad when it comes to managing misinformation, said assoc prof chua from the wee kim wee school of communication and information. many were apprehensive when singapore's vaccination programme began in earnest earlier this year, but the myths were quickly dispelled through the mainstream media and with the help of infectious diseases experts, said assoc prof chua. ips' dr soon and mr goh said of these efforts: ""effective communication of science is needed to build resilience against vaccine misinformation and foster public trust in science. ""public messaging should be clear and simple, for example by stating that vaccines are safe and effective, and highlighting scientific consensus on the matter helps inoculate people from being swayed by misinformation that claim otherwise. ""dr jeremy lim, from the saw swee hock school of public health, said that disagreements between doctors and professionals can still be cordial, agreeing to disagree. that said, transparency must also come from scientists, doctors, public health professionals too, considering that the nature of novel diseases means there will be limited data and experience to go by. ""in public communications, it's important to share views and recognise alternative ways of interpreting data, as well as be clear why one disagrees with certain points made,"" said dr lim. while some may argue that alternative views have been shut out of the official narrative, singapore's public communications strategies by and large have allowed national vaccination take-up rate to maintain a healthy trajectory, said those interviewed.  after all, the proof is in the pudding, they said. but at the individual level, when confronted with someone with wildly differing views that are based on falsehoods, ms tin urged people to not dismiss them and instead listen closely to their concerns. ""sometimes that can be very difficult to do and it can be an emotional experience,"" said ms tin.  ""but we just have to try. "" ― todayloading. . . © 2021, malay mail, all rights reserved.

conspiracy theorist or not, time will tell.', ""i'm not trying to argue with people, i'm just here to offer an alternative view."", 'if they decide to let their children be jabbed, i can only warn them,"" said mr goh.', 'he is an admistrator of two telegram groups that discuss covid-19 and vaccine injuries, each with thousands of members surfacing claims that the two authorised vaccines here — pfizer-biontech and moderna — have caused serious side effects such as stroke.', 'this is despite the fact that the singapore government has authorised the pfizer-biontech vaccine for teens aged 12 to 15, with an expert committee and the health sciences authority (hsa) assessing that the vaccine is safe and efficacious to use for this group.', '""you can gather a lot of knowledge from the internet.', 'not everything the doctor says about vaccines is correct,"" said mr goh.', 'mr goh was not always so radical, having dutifully received flu jabs and other types of vaccines in the past.', 'his transformation to become an anti-vaccine advocate began last year during the pandemic, after reading articles about the drug industrial complex behind cholesterol research.', 'nowadays, he gets his information from youtubers who discuss health issues and have a wide following, as well as from health journals that he reads to ""get to the source"" directly.', 'after all, newspapers can be biased, he claimed.', 'his contrarian views have led to conflicts with people around him.', 'his best friends removed him from their facebook friends list because his anti-vaccine posts have become ""too extreme"" lately.', 'his sister, who lives in france where some 110,000 people have died from covid-19, often chides him for telling others not to get the jab when he has not seen firsthand how horrific the disease can become outside of singapore.', 'but he is immovable in his radical belief that a good vaccine is not available because their development is rushed: ""people say i believe in conspiracy theories, that i am an anti-vaxxer, that i am crazy.', 'oh yes, i get that a lot.', '""mr goh is not the only one who has been socially distanced this way during the pandemic.', 'artist zelda, 34, has also seen her family ties and long-standing relationships strained or severed, as a result of her wild and unsubstantiated claims — such as one proclaiming that vaccines are part of a money-grubbing conspiracy by the ""global public health mafia"".', 'first, it was with her father, who reads the newspapers and has been vaccinated, and whom she often had heated arguments with.', 'to her, official narratives from governments and experts obscure the truth, while alternative viewpoints from youtube commentators deserve to be heard.', 'then, the fallout also spread to her close friends, whom she has known for decades, after she began sharing articles depicting covid-19 as a lab-made bioweapon, and defending these articles when her friends challenged her.', 'sick of arguing whenever zelda shares articles about such theories on their mutual chat groups, some of her childhood friends have since shut her out of their lives.', 'she declined to give her full name.', 'wistfully, one of these friends told today: ""she was always the first one to diffuse an argument.', ""but now she believes so much in this that she's willing to just abandon friends over it."",

believe in shape us, down to the relationships that we have,"" she added, referring to how she is no longer on talking terms with some of her friends.', 'as singaporeans, and people elsewhere, suffer

that, misinformation about the virus has far more serious implications as it could waylay singapore's pandemic plans, experts said."", 'as of june 9, singapore has vaccinated around 44 per cent of its population with at least one dose of the pfizer-biontech or moderna vaccines.', 'three in four seniors above 60 have had their jabs or booked an appointment.', 'but along with this progress, the number of incidents involving misinformation has also increased lately, some noted.', ""there have been three incidents about coronavirus-related falsehoods requiring the use of singapore's fake news law, the protection from online falsehoods and manipulation act (pofma), in the span of a month from april to may, noted mr ryan lim, founding partner of digital management consultancy qed

as pfizer's and moderna's, do not work."", ""he was referring to a petition by 12 doctors, who had disagreed with the government's decision to roll out mrna vaccines, and also discouraged parents from vaccinating their children."", 'eleven of the doctors later retracted their statement, and the authorities as well as a number of other infectious diseases experts were quick to respond to these vaccine claims.', ""while the viral situation is under control in singapore presently, dr shashi jayakumar, head of s rajaratnam school of international studies' centre of excellence for national security (cens), warned that the covid-19 situation could very well turn critical again for singapore."", ""and if it does, and if trust in the state and institutions is shaken as a result, malicious rumours, falsehoods, half-truths and misinformation would be back to plague singapore's pandemic response once again."", '""we are starting from a good position now.', 'but hypothetically, if there is wave after wave of infections, and lockdowns after lockdowns are needed, that would be the fertile ground for malicious misinformation to proliferate,"" he said.', 'fact, fiction and the unknowntracing the roots of misinformation to their sources would likely reveal one of several motivations behind its spread: these include political and ideological reasons, commercial profit, mischief, but also cases of genuine misunderstanding, said experts.', 'qed\'s mr lim said: ""such false content tends to thrive in an environment with a high degree of anxiety and ambiguity.', 'the successful spread will create a vicious circle that encourages more of such content to be created.', '""to date, pofma has been used in 14 separate instances concerning covid-19-related falsehoods.', 'but the amount of misinformation being spread during the pandemic is far more numerous than those flagged by the fake news law, which on its own, is insufficient to stop people from believing these claims, said experts.', 'associate professor alton chua from the wee kim wee school of communication and information at nanyang technological university said that while pofma is designed to nip the spread of falsehood in the bud, it is no silver bullet when it comes to shaping beliefs.', 'people can also suffer from confirmation bias, choosing to interpret information in a way that conforms to their existing beliefs, he said.', 'that means that those who are sceptical about covid-19 vaccines, for example, tend to exaggerate reports they come across about post-vaccination complications.', '""the mindset of \'better be safe than sorry\' is ironically what compels these people to share untruths,"" he said.', 'fast-evolving pandemic conducive for misinformationwhen it comes to covid-19, however, the scientific nature of the coronavirus and vaccines renders it hard for people to make their own conclusions about the science.', 'thus, it is key that people can turn to experts with the right credentials and experience to help them sort fact from fiction.', 'what makes this pandemic a perfect storm for misinformation to be reinforced and spread is because it concerns a new virus, fast-emerging viral strains, and cutting-edge vaccines that will take time to fully understand them.', 'and with science still playing catch-up with an evolving disease, there is a danger that misinformation can fill in the void and could even foster mistrust of scientific methods.', 'dr carol soon and mr shawn goh from the institute of policy studies (ips) at the lee kuan yew school of public policy said that a study they conducted last year had found that false information relating to health and medicine was second out of 11 topics that were most frequently believed by singaporeans.', 'falsehoods about international and foreign affairs came out tops in the study.', 'falsehoods on vaccine safetydr soon and mr goh warned that they have observed increasingly active forms of ""online mobilisation"" among people who circulate unverified information or mistruths about covid-19 vaccine safety and its purported side effects.', 'the ips researchers observed that people have been setting up facebook groups to share misinformation, and creating google forms to solicit stories and cases of vaccine injuries, often without the full context.', '""mobilisation is also taking place in closed-group platforms such as whatsapp and telegram.', 'the end-to-end encryption technology that undergirds instant messaging apps hinders timely misinformation detection and debunking,"" they said.', 'mr jake goh, who runs one such group on telegram, claimed that its purpose is to create awareness because ""transparency is needed in public health"", so that the public can make an informed decision about vaccines.', '""we are filling the gap that the ministry of health and all the relevant authorities are not providing or not announcing,"" he said.', 'he claimed that his vaccine scepticism is backed by his own research into the clinical trial data of existing vaccines.', 'the hsa reported in may that out of the 3.', '7 million vaccine doses administered until may 23, there were 157 reports of serious adverse effects such as anaphylaxis, but no deaths have been linked to the vaccines so far.', ""on this, ips' dr soon and mr shawn goh said that it is often the case that those who go the extra mile to look up information on vaccine efficacy may end up reinforcing their own beliefs."", '""their false beliefs may be reinforced when they draw invalid conclusions from scientific studies without a full appreciation of their robustness, or if they turn to \'scientific journals\' that are not actually recognised by the expert community,"" they said.', 'referring to these online mobilisation efforts, dr soon and mr shawn goh added: ""without intervention, these online spaces allow anti-vaccine views to fester and gain perceived legitimacy as they grow in size.', '""establishing links between vaccines and deaths: what public needs to understandexperts stressed the importance in trusting the scientific method — that conclusions can only be reached after observations, experiments and measurements are done.', 'professor teo yik ying, dean of the saw swee hock school of public health, said that there is a clear difference between proof of absence and the absence of proof.', 'it is one thing to issue a statement such as ""in all the participants in the clinical trials, we have not observed a death event"", as opposed to ""this vaccine does not cause death in anyone who takes it"", he said.', '""there is a need to systematically review the evidence of any mortality event that is suspected to be linked to the vaccine to understand whether taking the vaccine caused the fatality,"" he added.', 'because proper science takes time, it thus falls to a close partnership among responsible scientists, responsible media and trusted public agencies to be agile in responding to fake news in the meantime, he said.', 'all three parties are essential to this effort, since no single stakeholder holds all the cards needed to combat fake news.', 'the media and fact-checking organisations, for example, do not have the complete information needed to deal with complex scientific problems, but they should have access to trusted experts and policymakers to distill the information for the public.', 'this also means people should be wary of scientists who are not properly informed themselves, as well as irresponsible ones who could have been generating and spreading misinformation, said prof teo.', 'orchestrated disinformation campaignsanother aspect of misinformation concerns the threat of state-led disinformation campaigns, in the light of efforts by some countries to promote ""vaccine diplomacy"".', 'china, for example, is donating vaccines to regions where its competition with the us for influence is intense, reported reuters news agency.', 'the us has also announced its plans to donate 500 million doses of vaccines to the developing world, including in asia.', ""but could vaccine diplomacy also take on a more aggressive stance, such as by resorting to disinformation campaigns to discredit another country's vaccine?"", 'are such efforts already underway in singapore?it is possible, though drawing a link between a falsehood and a state-originated disinformation campaign is difficult, said ms dymples leong, a senior analyst at cens.', 'she noted that there has been misinformation revolving not just around vaccines in general, but also certain vaccines in particular.', 'asked whether vaccine geopolitics are at play in singapore, cens\' dr jayakumar said there is no doubt that vaccine diplomacy is now an important ""calling card"" of national soft power, so there are tensions whenever that soft power is being undermined.', 'he said that messages of indeterminate origin have been bandied around on social media creating fear about certain vaccine types, though he agreed with ms leong that it is not easy to conclude that these are state-led efforts.', 'nevertheless,

"" that will happen, the 71-year-old netanyahu added, ""sooner than people think"". the new government, formed after an inconclusive march 23 election, plans largely to avoid sweeping moves on hot-button international issues such as policy toward the palestinians, and to focus on domestic reforms. palestinians were unmoved by the change of administration, predicting that mr bennett, a former defence chief who advocates annexing parts of the occupied west bank, would pursue the same right-wing agenda as likud party leader netanyahu. israel's longest-serving leader, mr netanyahu was prime minister since 2009, after a first term from 1996 to 1999. but he was weakened by his repeated failure to clinch victory in four elections over the past two years, including a vote in march, and by an ongoing corruption trial, in which he has denied any wrongdoing. under the coalition deal, mr bennett, a 49-year-old orthodox jew and high-tech millionaire, will be replaced as prime minister by centrist yair lapid, 57, a popular former television host, in 2023. with his far-right yamina party winning only six of parliament's 120 seats in the last election, mr bennett's ascension to the premiership as the head of a kaleidoscope of parties was a political jaw-dropper. interrupted by non-stop shouts of ""liar"" and ""shame"" from netanyahu loyalists in parliament, mr bennett thanked him for his ""lengthy and achievement-filled service on behalf of the state of israel"". but little love has been lost between the two men: mr bennett once served as mr netanyahu's chief of staff and had a rocky relationship with him as defence minister.  in the run-up to the new government, bennett spurned mr netanyahu's call to join with him, rather than with mr lapid. on the international stage, with his polished english and booming baritone voice, mr netanyahu has become the face of israel. he has resisted international calls for palestinian statehood he has described as a danger to israel's security, while forging formal relations with the united arab emirates, bahrain, morocco and sudan and decrying iran's nuclear programme. united states president joe biden congratulated mr bennett, mr lapid and the rest of the new cabinet and said he looked forward to working with mr bennett to strengthen the ""close and enduring"" relationship between their two countries. ""my administration is fully committed to working with the new israeli government to advance security, stability, and peace for israelis, palestinians, and people throughout the broader region,"" he said in a statement. both abroad and at home, mr netanyahu has been a polarising figure.  often referred to by his nickname bibi, mr netanyahu is loved by his supporters and loathed by critics.  his ongoing corruption trial – on charges he denies – has only deepened the rift. his opponents have long reviled what they see as mr netanyahu's divisive rhetoric, underhand political tactics and subjection of state interests to his own political survival.  some have dubbed him ""crime minister"" and have accused him of mishandling the coronavirus crisis and its economic fall-out. addressing parliament, mr bennett echoed mr netanyahu's call for the us not to return to the 2015 nuclear pact between iran and world powers, a deal abrogated by mr biden's predecessor donald trump. ""renewal of the nuclear agreement with iran is a mistake, an error that would again grant legitimisation to one of the darkest and violent regimes in the world,"" mr bennett said.  ""israel will not allow iran to equip itself with nuclear weapons. ""thanking mr biden for his ""years of commitment to israel's security"", and for ""standing by israel"" during fighting with hamas militants in gaza last month, mr bennett said his government would pursue good relations with us democrats and republicans. ""the government will make an effort to deepen and enhance our relations with both parties – bipartisan,"" mr bennett said. mr bennett has drawn anger from within the right-wing camp for breaking a campaign pledge by joining forces with mr lapid – and an allegation from netanyahu that he defrauded the electorate. mr bennett has said another election – a likely outcome if no government were formed – would have been a disaster for israel. both mr bennett and mr lapid have said they want to bridge political divides and unite israelis under a government that will work hard for all its citizens. their cabinet faces huge foreign, security and financial challenges: iran, a fragile ceasefire with palestinian militants in gaza, a war crimes probe by the international criminal court, and economic recovery following the coronavirus pandemic. bennett listed as priorities reforms in education, health, cutting red tape to grow businesses and lower housing costs. coalition leaders have said it would pass a two-year budget to help stabilise the country's finances and maintain a ""status quo"" on issues of religion and state. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-14,"G-7's billion Covid-19 vaccine plan counts some past pledges, limiting impact, United States News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. washington (reuters) a g-7 plan to donate 1 billion covid-19 vaccine doses to poorer countries will have limited impact because it includes some previous pledges, but it still offers a small lifeline to a global vaccine buying system, some experts said. leaders from the group of seven major economies announced the move on friday (june 11).  a us initiative announced on thursday to donate 500 million doses of the pfizer and biontech se vaccine is part of the g-7 pledge. many of the promised doses will flow through covax, a global vaccine buying system backed by the world health organisation and gavi, the vaccine alliance. the pledge does not represent entirely new resources, and the donation is far short of the 5 billion to 6 billion shots needed by poorer nations.  moreover, the plan does not address distribution gaps that could make it difficult to deliver doses. but experts said it is still a much-needed boost to covax, which has so far only distributed 83 million shots worldwide. covax has struggled to secure deliveries as wealthy nations reserve enough shots to vaccinate their populations several times over. ""it's going to rescue covax from its pretty dire predicament right now, so it's a very significant step,"" said stephen morrison, the director of the global health policy center at the centre for strategic and international studies, a think tank. britain's 100 million dose pledge is ""entirely new"", according to a spokesperson.  but the european union's 100 million dose commitment was promised during a summit in may, and the us commitment partially replaces earlier promises to fund covax directly. the united states has already donated us$2 billion (s$2. 7 billion) to covax, according to a white house official.  in february, the biden administration pledged us$2 billion more.  but that second us$2 billion will now fund the purchase of the pfizer doses, along with us$1. 5 billion in additional funds, according to the official. even if the shots are acquired and shipped, they risk overwhelming developing countries' limited distribution infrastructure, especially if many are delivered together late this year. the world bank extended a us$12 billion line of credit for developing countries to build out vaccine distribution infrastructure, but governments have drawn down only about us$3 billion. ""the low-income countries are wary of increasing their debt profile, that is the reality,"" said edwin ikhuoria, executive director for the one campaign, a nonprofit focused on poverty and public health. others argue that wealthy countries should find a way to ship doses more quickly, especially as some near expiry in countries with high vaccination rates, including those made by johnson & johnson inc.

2021-06-14,PSG.LGD outlast T1 to reach WePlay AniMajor grand finals.,"chinese powerhouse psg. lgd is the first team to reach the grand finals of the weplay animajor after they defeated southeast asian squad t1 in an intense 2-1 showdown in the upper bracket finals. psg. lgd emerged as the heavy favourites to win the animajor after a blazing start in the group stage, where they topped the standings with a stellar 11-3 record.  that earned the chinese squad an upper bracket berth in the playoffs, where they continued their dominance by knocking eu/ western european teams alliance and team nigma down to the lower bracket en route to the upper bracket finals. meanwhile, t1 earned a direct seed to the upper bracket of the animajor playoffs as the top team of the southeast asian regional league.  despite being pegged as one of the weaker playoff-seeded teams, t1 defied expectations by taking down team aster and quincy crew — the top teams of the chinese and north american regional leagues, respectively — to face off against psg. lgd for a spot in the grand finals. psg. lgd crushed t1 in game one but threw away their chance to sweep the series late into game two.  however, the chinese team were undeterred heading into game three and proceeded to dominate their opponents to claim the 2-1 series victory and claim their spot in the grand finals.  read on for a breakdown of the weplay animajor upper bracket finals:game onethe upper bracket finals opened with t1 going with their tried-and-true four-protect-one strategy anchored by star carry player nuengnara ""23savage"" teeramahanon's medusa.  meanwhile, psg. lgd countered with a fast-paced, hard-hitting lineup led by a tri-core of spectre for wang ""ame"" chunyu, a mid leshrac for cheng ""nothingtosay"" jin xiang, and an offlane dragon knight for zhang ""faith_bian"" ruida.  the support duo of zhao ""xinq"" zixing on hoodwink and zhang ""y`"" yiping on winter wyvern brought up the rear and provided crowd control. psg. lgd took control of game one early, as nothingtosay's leshrac and faith_bian's dragon knight demolished enemy towers and took map control for their team to give ame's spectre the space he needed to free farm.  the chinese team's early lead allowed them to hit their timings early and strike before 23savage's medusa was able to come online. with 23savage far from being able to solo carry and the rest of t1 essentially neutered, psg. lgd dominated the team fights and took game one after 31 minutes.  ame and xinq notably combined for 22 of their team's 32 total kills without giving up a single death between the two of them. game twopsg. lgd went with ame on spectre and nothingtosay on leshrac again for game two.  however, their lineup also featured a lot of burst damage with faith_bian on axe, xinq on skywrath mage, and y` on enchantress. t1 looked to bounce back with a more balanced lineup headed by a tri-core of monkey king for 23savage, puck for karl ""karl"" jayme, and an offlane doom for carlo ""kuku"" palad. t1 put up a much better fight in game two as they led 12-9 in kills held a narrow gold lead by the 20-minute mark.  however, psg. lgd were able to win crucial midgame fights to take the lead heading into the late game, where their lineup was much stronger than t1. knowing they were in the driver's seat, psg. lgd amped up the aggression and tried to force one last decisive engagement.  however, t1 punished their opponents' over-aggression and were the ones to win that crucial clash and the second game of the series after 47 minutes of action. karl's puck was the difference maker for t1 as they forced the series to a deciding game three, as he provided crucial crowd control and burst damage en route to a game-high 12 kills against three deaths. game threet1 put karl on puck again in game three then took the spectre-axe duo for 23savage and kuku.  xepher on winter wyvern and whitemon on warlock rounded out the line-up by providing huge team fight ultimates. meanwhile, psg. lgd countered their opponents' slower line-up with a fast-paced tri-core of wraith king for ame, leshrac again for nothingtosay, and doom for faith_bian.  xinq on nyx assassin and y` on phoenix comprised the chinese team's support duo. psg. lgd took control of game three from the get-go and never looked back.  the chinese team built up a 10-4 kill lead and a 8,000 gold advantage by the 20-minute mark which only ballooned up to a 16-6 kill lead and 20,000 gold advantage ten minutes later.  despite t1's best efforts to defend, their line-up simply failed to get off the ground and could do little to stop psg. lgd from claiming the 2-1 series victory after 35 minutes. with their victory, psg. lgd guarantee themselves at least a top 2 finish in the weplay animajor along with us$100,000 and 450 dota pro circuit (dpc) points.  of course, they will have their sights set on being crowned as major champions on sunday (13 june) and claim the lion's share of us$200,000 and 500 dpc points. meanwhile, t1 drop down to the lower bracket finals, where they will take on north american giants evil geniuses (eg), who were the finalists of the one esports singapore major.  those two squads will be facing off before the grand finals for the right to challenge psg. lgd for the championship of the weplay animajor. psg. lgd:wang ""ame"" chunyucheng

2021-06-14,Risk of heart inflammation after second dose of mRNA Covid-19 vaccine “very small”: S’pore expert committee.,"they occur more often in men compared to women. authordatecategorysingapore – according to the expert committee on covid-19 vaccination in singapore, there is a ""very small risk"" of heart inflammation after receiving the second dose of an mrna covid-19 vaccine; however, the ""benefits continue to outweigh the risks. ""the expert committee is closely monitoring international reports regarding the second dose of an mrna covid-19 vaccine being associated with a small risk of myocarditis and pericarditis in young men, said the ministry of health (moh) in a media release on friday (jun 11). myocarditis and pericarditis are inflammatory conditions affecting the heart muscles and the outer lining of the heart, respectively. they occur more often in men compared to women.  patients have shown symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or abnormal heartbeats, said moh. although most cases are mild, with patients recovering without the need for significant intervention and do not suffer long-term effects, ""very rarely severe cases may result in damage to the heart. ""increased occurrences of myocarditis and pericarditis after the second dose of mrna covid-19 vaccinations have been observed overseas in israel and the united states (us) in young men below the age of 25 years. the risk of this has been estimated to be 1. 6 cases per 100,000 doses for mrna vaccines in the us, which is comparable to the risk of anaphylaxis observed in singapore. locally, the health sciences authority (hsa) has reported four cases involving young men aged between 18 to 30 years. moh noted that the incidents occurred at the upper end of the expected range for the age group.  most of the cases were reported within a few days after receiving the second dose of the vaccine. all of the men have recovered or been discharged well from the hospital. myocarditis and pericarditis are separate and distinct conditions from heart attacks caused when blood flow to the heart is blocked. ""we have reviewed the currently available international and local data,"" said moh. ""our assessment is that the benefits of receiving the mrna covid-19 vaccines, i. e. , reduction in covid-19 infections and severe complications even if infected, continue to outweigh the risks of vaccination. ""as a precaution, adolescents and younger men, in particular, should avoid strenuous physical activity for one week after their second dose. ""during this time, they should seek medical attention promptly if they develop chest pain, shortness of breath, or abnormal heartbeats,"" advised the expert committee. /tisgread related: about 2,000

2021-06-14,Coronavirus: Athletes told to take courtesy condoms home amid physical distancing rules in Olympic Village.,"follow onadvertisement

tokyo -- 
	tokyo olympic organizers plan to give away about 150,000 condoms at next month's games, but are telling athletes to take them home rather than use them in the olympic village where physical distancing rules and coronavirus measures are the top priority. 
	large numbers of condoms have been given out at the games since the 1988 seoul olympics to raise awareness of hiv and aids, and organizers said the international olympic committee had requested their continued distribution. 
	but athletes have been told to keep their distance from each other, meaning fewer opportunities to mingle and more. 
	""the distribution of condoms is not for use at the athlete's village, but to have athletes take them back to their home countries to raise awareness"" of hiv and aids issues, said tokyo 2020 in an emailed response to questions by reuters. 
	officials have already barred overseas spectators and are asking those who do attend the delayed event to show their support by clapping rather than cheering or singing to try and reduce the risk of spreading the virus. 
	dining has become another issue to resolve. 
	organizers were originally planning to feed residents of the village in vast dining halls – the largest one with a capacity to seat 4,500 people at once. 
	but now, the organizers will ask athletes to dine alone, maintain social distancing with others, and wipe down surfaces after eating.

""my expectation is by later in the week, we will be in a position to announce further easing of restrictions for regional victoria and . . .  for metropolitan melbourne,"" merlino said. merlino added he was keen to get people back to attending sporting events and theatre, though he had no announcement to make yet in that regard. under existing curbs, melbourne residents can only travel up to 25 kilometres (15. 5 miles) from home while outdoor gatherings are limited to 10 people.  masks are required indoors and outdoors at all public spaces. also read: covid-19: australia's victoria enters 7-day lockdownmore than 3,000 primary close contacts of infected cases are already in quarantine with about 122 exposure sites listed on the victorian government website. australia has fared much better than many other developed countries during the pandemic, with more than 22,300 local covid-19 cases and 910 deaths since march 2020, mostly in victorian aged-care homes. snap lockdowns, internal border controls and tough social distancing rules have helped it contain prior outbreaks. new south wales, australia's most populous state, and neighbouring queensland are on high alert after an infected woman and her husband travelled from victoria through several country towns in both states. with no new cases on sunday, new south wales, which includes the largest city, sydney, has not reported any locally acquired infection in more than a month, while queensland last reported cases in late march. get our daily newsletter
