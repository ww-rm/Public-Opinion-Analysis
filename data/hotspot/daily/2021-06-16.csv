2021-06-16,Centuries-old shipwrecks discovered in Singapore waters; artefacts to be displayed in museums.,"
                    wednesday, 16 jun 2021
                both wrecks, bearing chinese ceramics as their primary cargo, were found in the waters off pedra branca.  iseas yusof ishak institutesingapore (the straits times/ann): two shipwrecks one dating possibly to the 14th century and the other to the 18th have been excavated within singapore's waters a first for the nation and a groundbreaking development for its maritime heritage. both wrecks, bearing chinese ceramics as their primary cargo, were found in the waters off pedra branca, a rocky outcrop surrounded by shallow waters where ships throughout history have come to grief. the plan is to display the artefacts in museums here from the end of this year. maritime archaeologist michael flecker, who supervised both excavations, described the first wreck as a ""pretty remarkable"" find, as it is contemporary with the temasek period that spans the 1300s to 1600s. while research may never reveal the exact vessel that sank, as no remnants of its hull remain, the second wreck has been identified as the india-built merchant vessel shah munchah. it sank in 1796 as it was returning to india from china. how the wrecks were discoveredit all started with an accident. a singapore-registered barge carrying two bulk loader cranes encountered bad weather while on its way to kuantan and ran aground at pedra branca on dec 30, 2014. the two cranes were at risk of toppling onto pedra branca's famous horsburgh lighthouse, which was built in 1851. to prevent this from happening, dynamite was attached to the two cranes, and they were blown up while two boats pulled them away from the lighthouse, scattering metal into the sea. commercial divers were then hired to clear the area of these scraps. it was while diving to retrieve the scraps in 2015 that ramdzan salim, a project manager, and ahmad qamarulhazman, a diver, stumbled across stacks of old ceramic plates, said dr michael flecker, a visiting fellow at the iseas-yusof ishak institute's archaeology unit. at around the same time, a 10-week-long archaeological dig was being carried out at a site in empress place. the divers, while following media coverage of the findings, realised that some plates retrieved near pedra branca looked very similar to artefacts retrieved in empress place, and decided to hand over the plates to the institute for further research and safekeeping. upon the institute's confirmation that the plates were high quality celadon ceramics dated to the 14th century, the national heritage board partnered the institute to conduct a survey at the pedra branca site, discovering a shipwreck in 2016. following the end of excavation works for the first shipwreck, nhb and iseas conducted a survey around pedra branca and uncovered a second shipwreck dating to the late 18th century.  efforts were then made to excavate this shipwreck between 2019 and 2021. the first wreck was located about 100m north-west of the island, the national heritage board (nhb) and iseas announced on wednesday (june 16).  the second wreck was found 300m east of pedra branca. what was foundin an interview with the straits times about the historic finds, dr flecker said various chinese ceramics formed a large majority of the haul from the first wreck, with some matching those previously excavated in mainland singapore. for instance, longquan greenware dishes from the first wreck match those that had been unearthed earlier at fort canning, with both bearing a double fish motif. ""from fort canning, there is a plate that is so similar you might almost be tempted to think they used the same stamp (to produce the motif),"" said dr flecker, a visiting fellow at iseas. while research is ongoing, dr flecker said the find would be especially significant if it could be proven that the vessel was going to call at singapore something he believes to be true. ceramics from the wreck are also similar to those excavated at empress place in 2015, and more research will be done to improve existing knowledge on maritime trading history in the region during the 14th century. dr flecker, who has about 30 years of maritime archaeology experience, added that the yuan blue-and-white ceramic haul from the first wreck is also the largest that has been recovered from a shipwreck to date. ""there's only been three other (wreck) sites with yuan blue-and-white porcelain anywhere in the world, and in much smaller quantities,"" he said, adding that it was clear from the primary cargo of both vessels chinese ceramics that they were loaded in china. the shah munchah wreck site yielded a much wider range of artefacts, from instruments to cannons. among the surprising finds were percussion instruments, including a tambourine and a coconut shaker with a handle, said dr flecker. wooden frame parasols, metal betel nut cutters and a myriad of figurines were also retrieved by divers. the heaviest finds were four anchors as long as 5m and weighing 2. 5 tonnes each and nine cannons, which required a craned vessel to remove them from the seabed. dr flecker said the anchors were designed in the admiralty style, adding: ""they are suitable for very large sailing vessels so it's a good find and it's well worth getting them up for conservation. ""the nine cannons, which dr flecker described as a ""representative set"" of what was used then, were typically mounted on ships employed by the east india company in the 18th and early 19th centuries, and used for defence as well as signalling. artefacts are currently being stored at facilities managed by both nhb and iseas, where they will be cleaned, conserved and catalogued. about the shah munchah, dr flecker said: ""had she survived another 23 years, she would almost certainly have called at the re-established port of singapore. ""her incredibly diverse cargo provides great insights into the type of goods that would have been exchanged and purchased by the new inhabitants of this fledgling city. ""the two historical shipwrecks are the first to be found within singapore's waters, and will contribute to a better understanding of the nation's maritime past.  as there were no claims to the wrecks and their artefacts at the end of the stipulated notice period of a month, they have been claimed by singapore. although it is very likely there are more wrecks on the seabed in singapore's waters, some of these have been covered by reclamation, while heavy maritime traffic in the singapore strait makes locating others a hazard. nhb's director of heritage research and assessment yeo kirk siang said: ""as an island that has been serving as the gateway to asia for centuries, singapore today is the legacy of our rich maritime heritage. ""we will continue to research the significance of the artefacts and find ways to promote the knowledge, so as to enable more people to learn about them and singapore's maritime history. ""nhb plans to display the artefacts in museums here from the end of this year, while iseas will likely publish findings progressively in reports and research papers.  the straits times/asia news network

            wednesday, 16 jun 2021\n                both wrecks, bearing chinese ceramics as their primary cargo, were found in the waters off pedra branca.', ""iseas yusof ishak institutesingapore (the straits times/ann): two shipwrecks one dating possibly to the 14th century and the other to the 18th have been excavated within singapore's waters a first for the nation and a groundbreaking development for its maritime heritage."", 'both wrecks, bearing chinese ceramics as their primary cargo, were found in the waters off pedra branca, a rocky outcrop surrounded by shallow waters where ships throughout history have come to grief.', 'the plan is to display the artefacts in museums here from the end of this year.', 'maritime archaeologist michael flecker, who supervised both excavations, described the first wreck as a ""pretty remarkable"" find, as it is contemporary with the temasek period that spans the 1300s to 1600s.', 'while research may never reveal the exact vessel that sank, as no remnants of its hull remain, the second wreck has been identified as the india-built merchant vessel shah munchah.', 'it sank in 1796 as it was returning to india from china.', 'how the wrecks were discoveredit all started with an accident.', ""a singapore-registered barge carrying two bulk loader cranes encountered bad weather while on its way to kuantan and ran aground at pedra branca on dec 30, 2014. the two cranes were at risk of toppling onto pedra branca's famous horsburgh lighthouse, which was built in 1851. to prevent this from happening, dynamite was attached to the two cranes, and they were blown up while two boats pulled them away from the lighthouse, scattering metal into the sea."", 'commercial divers were then hired to clear the area of these scraps.', ""it was while diving to retrieve the scraps in 2015 that ramdzan salim, a project manager, and ahmad qamarulhazman, a diver, stumbled across stacks of old ceramic plates, said dr michael flecker, a visiting fellow at the iseas-yusof ishak institute's archaeology unit."", 'at around the same time, a 10-week-long archaeological dig was being carried out at a site in empress place.', 'the divers, while following media coverage of the findings, realised that some plates retrieved near pedra branca looked very similar to artefacts retrieved in empress place, and decided to hand over the plates to the institute for further research and safekeeping.', ""upon the institute's confirmation that the plates were high quality celadon ceramics dated to the 14th century, the national heritage board partnered the institute to conduct a survey at the pedra branca site, discovering a shipwreck in 2016. following the end of excavation works for the first shipwreck, nhb and iseas conducted a survey around pedra branca and uncovered a second shipwreck dating to the late 18th century."", 'efforts were then made to excavate this shipwreck between 2019 and 2021. the first wreck was located about 100m north-west of the island, the national heritage board (nhb) and iseas announced on wednesday (june 16).', 'the second wreck was found 300m east of pedra branca.', 'what was foundin an interview with the straits times about the historic finds, dr flecker said various chinese ceramics formed a large majority of the haul from the first wreck, with some matching those previously excavated in mainland singapore.', 'for instance, longquan greenware dishes from the first wreck match those that had been unearthed earlier at fort canning, with both bearing a double fish motif.', '""from fort canning, there is a plate that is so similar you might almost be tempted to think they used the same stamp (to produce the motif),"" said dr flecker, a visiting fellow at iseas.', 'while research is ongoing, dr flecker said the find would be especially significant if it could be proven that the vessel was going to call at singapore something he believes to be true.', 'ceramics from the wreck are also similar to those excavated at empress place in 2015, and more research will be done to improve existing knowledge on maritime trading history in the region during the 14th century.', 'dr flecker, who has about 30 years of maritime archaeology experience, added that the yuan blue-and-white ceramic haul from the first wreck is also the largest that has been recovered from a shipwreck to date.', '""there\'s only been three other (wreck) sites with yuan blue-and-white porcelain anywhere in the world, and in much smaller quantities,"" he said, adding that it was clear from the primary cargo of both vessels chinese ceramics that they were loaded in china.', 'the shah munchah wreck site yielded a much wider range of artefacts, from instruments to cannons.', 'among the surprising finds were percussion instruments, including a tambourine and a coconut shaker with a handle, said dr flecker.', 'wooden frame parasols, metal betel nut cutters and a myriad of figurines were also retrieved by divers.', 'the heaviest finds were four anchors as long as 5m and weighing 2.', '5 tonnes each and nine cannons, which required a craned vessel to remove them from the seabed.', 'dr flecker said the anchors were designed in the admiralty style, adding: ""they are suitable for very large sailing vessels so it\'s a good find and it\'s well worth getting them up for conservation.', '""the nine cannons, which dr flecker described as a ""representative set"" of what was used then, were typically mounted on ships employed by the east india company in the 18th and early 19th centuries, and used for defence as well as signalling.', 'artefacts are currently being stored at facilities managed by both nhb and iseas, where they will be cleaned, conserved and catalogued.', 'about the shah munchah, dr flecker said: ""had she survived another 23 years, she would almost certainly have called at the re-established port of singapore.', '""her incredibly diverse cargo provides great insights into the type of goods that would have been exchanged and purchased by the new inhabitants of this fledgling city.', '""the two historical shipwrecks are the first to be found within singapore\'s waters, and will contribute to a better understanding of the nation\'s maritime past.', 'as there were no claims to the wrecks and their artefacts at the end of the stipulated notice period of a month, they have been claimed by singapore.', ""although it is very likely there are more wrecks on the seabed in singapore's waters, some of these have been covered by reclamation, while heavy maritime traffic in the singapore strait makes locating others a hazard."", 'nhb\'s director of heritage research and assessment yeo kirk siang said: ""as an island that has been serving as the gateway to asia for centuries, singapore today is the legacy of our rich maritime heritage.', '""we will continue to research the significance of the artefacts and find ways to promote the knowledge, so as to enable more people to learn about them and singapore\'s maritime history.', '""nhb plans to display the artefacts in museums here from the end of this year, while iseas will likely publish findings progressively in reports

""but i've been living in singapore for nearly 37 years now, so it's fantastic to be able to work on some groundbreaking project which is directly related to singapore's early heyday the temasek period. """"there are just some places in south-east asia and the south china sea where you can see a rig or rock out in the middle of nowhere, and it's just something that would be worth you spending a lot of time and effort looking because the probability of a wreck being there is very high,"" he said. history has proven pedra branca's danger to vessels, he said in his 2018 lecture, listing examples, including the 1796 wreck of the india built merchant vessel, shah munchah, which he would find the following year. in 1596, dutch merchant john huyghen van linschoten wrote about the rocky island as ""where ships that come and go from china do oftentimes pass in great danger and some are left upon it"". hydrographer james horsburgh, whom the 1851-built lighthouse on pedra branca is named after, wrote in 1809 about the shah munchah's demise, reporting that the vessel was ""totally lost, by the tide horsing her upon the rock"", while changing course. dr flecker said: ""before she could do that, she was just piled onto the rocks by the current.  and the current out there is vicious. ""having waited more than two decades to study the infamous site, dr flecker and his team have left no stone unturned in their surveys since 2016. he told st that his team had conducted a thorough survey in the shallow waters surrounding the island, spanning as far as 500m away from the island, and that it is unlikely more wrecks in those areas would be found. ""we've covered all the areas of the highest wrecking potential, so we've essentially looked everywhere a vessel could strike,"" he said. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-16,Israel strikes Gaza in response to incendiary balloons.,"gaza city: israel carried out air strikes on the gaza strip early on wednesday (jun 16) after militants in the palestinian territory sent incendiary balloons into the south of the country, in the first major conflict between the two sides since a flare-up in may in which hundreds were killed. the strikes were the first under the new coalition government headed by naftali bennett, whotook over on sundayafter ousting former prime minister benjamin netanyahu. and they come as more than a thousand ultranationalist demonstrators bearing israeli flags poured into jerusalem's flashpoint old city on tuesday, with scores of police deployed and international monitors urging calm. according to palestinian sources, israel's air force targeted at least one site east of khan yunis in the south of the gaza strip, which is home to about two million people. an afp photojournalist in khan yunis saw the explosions. the israeli defence force said that in response to the ""arson balloons"", its ""fighter jets struck military compounds belonging to the hamas terror organisation"". it added that ""facilities and meeting sites for terror operatives"" in khan yunis were targeted.  there was no indication of casualties so far. local firefighters said the incendiary balloons caused around 20 fires in southern israel. the violence marks the first major flare-up between israel and palestinian militants since a ceasefire came into place in may, ending 11 days of heavy fighting that killed 260 palestinians, according to gaza authorities, and 13 people in israel, the police and army there said. restraintin annexed east jerusalem, more than one thousand people took to the streets in a delayed and controversial march by nationalist and far-right activists. the us and un had called for restraint before the march, which bennett's new administration had authorised. with tensions high, israeli police were deployed in heavy numbers, blocking roads and firing stun grenades and foam-tipped bullets to remove palestinians from the main route. medics said 33 palestinians were wounded and police said two officers were injured and 17 people arrested. the demonstration triggered protests in the west bank and gaza strip and prompted rebukes and warnings from israel's allies. the so-called march of the flags celebrates the anniversary of the city's ""reunification"" after israel captured east jerusalem from jordan in 1967 and annexed it, a move not recognised by most of the international community. tuesday's demonstration was originally scheduled for early may but cancelled twice amid police opposition and threats from hamas, the islamist group that controls the palestinian enclave of gaza. throngs of mostly young religious men sang, danced and waved flags at the damascus gate entrance to the old city that was cleared of its usual palestinian crowds. some chanted ""death to arabs"" before others quieted them. 'provocation'the march comes just two days after netanyahu was ousted after 12 straight years in power, toppled by an ideologically divided coalition including, for the first time in israel's history, an arab party. bennett is himself a jewish nationalist but netanyahu's allies accused the new premier of treachery for allying with arabs and the left. some demonstrators on tuesday carried signs reading ""bennett the liar"". yair lapid, the architect of the new government, tweeted he believed the march had to be allowed but that ""it's inconceivable how you can hold an israeli flag and shout, 'death to arabs' at the same time.

2021-06-16,"NParks to step up patrols, put up more signs to prevent manhandling of intertidal creatures, Environment News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore the national parks board (nparks) said on tuesday (june 15) that it will be taking extra steps to prevent beachgoers from manhandling marine creatures in intertidal areas, following an influx of people to changi beach during low tide last weekend. these include putting up more signs and stepping up patrols by nparks staff, volunteers and nature groups, said mr ryan lee, group director of nparks' national biodiversity centre, in response to media queries. ""we will raise awareness on the detrimental effects of touching, collecting or trampling on marine wildlife in their natural habitats,"" he added. touching wildlife causes unnecessary stress to these creatures.  soft-bodied organisms may also be vulnerable to injury from being poked and prodded. crowds armed with pails, tongs and shovels were seen flocking to the intertidal areas of changi beach at low tide on sunday (june 13). they were also seen gathering in groups of more than two which had been the covid-19 safe management requirement then. but they were not there to pick up rubbish. instead, posts circulating on social media showed families poking and digging up marine creatures such as anemones, crabs and jellyfish and placing them in buckets. it was not immediately clear from the photographs and videos if the creatures were being harvested as seafood. animals not typically consumed, such as sea anemones, were also seen in the buckets. mr lee said nparks was concerned by the large number of visitors over the weekend to the intertidal area in changi beach, and the collection of shellfish and other invertebrates. however, other than certain rare species, invertebrates marine and land creatures without backbones, including shellfish and crabs are not protected under the wildlife act. the act, which came into effect in 2020, is meant to extend greater protection to singapore's native wildlife. the straits times understands that conservationists had, during consultations on the scope of the law, raised the need to include such creatures under the wildlife act. queried on this, nparks told st that other than certain rare species, it would be challenging for the act to cover all invertebrates as this would include common pests, such as ants and cockroaches. as for the parks and trees act another piece of legislation governing the use of singapore's nature areas mr lee said the intertidal area of changi beach is not covered under it. st understands that while nparks manages changi beach park, the beaches are not under its purview. under the parks and trees act, wildlife, including invertebrates, cannot be collected in singapore's nature reserves and parks, including sisters' islands marine park, sungei buloh wetland reserve, labrador nature reserve's rocky shore and chek jawa wetlands. mr lee said singapore's parks are shared spaces for all to enjoy. he added: ""we request park visitors to be socially responsible and to keep our green spaces safe for everyone. ""national university of singapore marine biologist neo mei lin, who studies giant clams – invertebrates threatened with extinction in singapore and covered under the wildlife act – said nparks' proposed efforts are welcome and greatly needed, especially for seashores easily accessible to the public.  but she added: ""i still firmly believe that we need to include underappreciated invertebrates under the act, even if this is done in a phased manner of first including the more endangered ones.  otherwise, the law gives the impression that it's okay to mistreat these creatures, while at the same time criminalising those who pluck plants in our public parks. ""last weekend's incident was the latest in a string of cases involving marine life affected by human recreational activities in singapore. in may, an eagle ray was reeled in at east coast park and dragged to shore, thrashing all the way. it followed another incident earlier in may involving a critically endangered hawksbill turtle, found dead within a drift net in the waters off pulau hantu, one of singapore's southern islands. another drift net found draped over corals off lazarus island was later retrieved by marine biologists from the national university of singapore. the net had ""whipped"" the corals leaving marks on their soft tissue and also ensnared crabs, one of which had been found alive but without four of its legs. drift nets are kept vertical by floats at the top and weights at the bottom, and they trap everything in their path. while the fisheries act bars the use of trawl nets, poison or explosives to catch fish, it is not clear if drift nets are allowed. st has reached out to the singapore food agency for comment. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-16,Ronaldo breaks Euro goalscoring record as Portugal beat Hungary.,"cristiano ronaldo netted a double to become the european championship's all-time leading scorer as portugal struck three times late on to beat a stubborn hungary 3-0 in their euro 2020 opener at a packed puskas arena on tuesday. the holders, who appear to have a much stronger squad than when they won their first major title five years ago, laboured for long periods in budapest. but raphael guerreiro made the vital breakthrough in the 84th minute and ronaldo slammed in a penalty shortly afterwards before tapping home in injury time. ""it was essential to start on the right foot in order to gain confidence,"" said ronaldo.  ""now, we have to continue and win the next game. ""the juventus striker has now scored 11 goals in the tournament, two more than french great michel platini, who netted nine times when he led france to glory in 1984. the 36-year-old is also just three goals away from matching iranian ali daei's all-time international scoring record of 109. ""it was a difficult game, against an opponent who defended very well during 90 minutes, but we scored three goals, and i am very grateful to the team for helping me to score two goals,"" he added. ronaldo chose by far the biggest crowd of the tournament to break the record in front of, with budapest the only euro 2020 venue not to limit fan capacity due to covid-19. the puskas arena has a capacity of almost 68,000 fans. ""we didn't deserve a 3-0 defeat, with a bit of luck it could have been a point each, but it was an experience of a lifetime,"" said hungary goalkeeper peter gulacsi. world cup winners france and three-time european champions germany meet in the other group f game later in the day at munich's allianz arena. portugal coach fernando santos opted to play liverpool forward diogo jota and bernardo silva alongside ronaldo, with joao felix left on the bench. it almost paid instant dividends, as jota forced gulacsi into a smart save with a left-footed drive in the fourth minute, although he perhaps should have squared the ball for an unmarked ronaldo. the portuguese talisman created an opportunity for bernardo silva in the 28th minute by winning the ball back high up the pitch, only for the manchester city winger to delay his shot too long and see the opening snuffed out by an excellent tackle from hungary centre-back willi orban. hungary offered very little from open play, although they sent portugal a warning shortly before half-time when adam szalai headed a free-kick too close to rui patricio. ronaldo misses glorious chance -the best chance of the opening period fell to ronaldo in the 44th minute, only for the portugal captain to plant the ball over from six yards out after meeting guerreiro's low cross. portugal came out of the blocks quickly after the break, knowing failure to win would put them in trouble in such a difficult group, with pepe seeing a downward header well saved by the stretching gulacsi. santos' men continued to press despite hungary growing in confidence, with bruno fernandes drawing gulacsi into another fine stop with a dipping strike from long range. despite having felix, in-form eintracht frankfurt striker andre silva and pedro goncalves, last season's top scorer in the portuguese league, on the bench, santos waited until the 71st minute to make a change, sending on rafa silva for bernardo silva. hungary thought they had snatched a shock lead through substitute szabolcs schon, but he was denied by the offside flag. rafa silva played a key role in the opening goal, though, as his deflected cross was met by guerreiro, whose shot also took a huge deflection and dribbled agonisingly into the corner of the hungarian net. the home side's resistance was totally over three minutes later, as orban pulled back rafa silva clean through on goal. ronaldo made no mistake, sending gulacsi the wrong way to add another record to his collection on the day he became the first player in history to play at five european championships. there was more to come from ronaldo, as he danced through after a one-two with rafa silva and rolled in his 106th goal for portugal. jc/asbeijing's new top diplomat in hong

""she rejected him and said ""you can just talk and not get touchy"", before going into her room.  she did not consent to the touch and felt annoyed by what she perceived to be a disrespectful act. in the same period, chan grabbed her as she walked past a sofa in the living room, in an attempt to pull her in his direction.  in response, the victim flung his hand away and told him not to get touchy before entering her room. from end-june to mid-july 2018, while both were in the flat at around 6. 30am, the victim was walking out of the kitchen when she saw chan standing inside the toilet naked with the door open.  he was touching his private parts as he made eye contact with her. even as the victim asked him what he was doing, chan continued touching his private parts.  chan's wife had been sleeping then. from the moment chan began exposing himself to her, the victim would use weapons to protect herself and lock the door before sleeping. a few days later, in the evening, while the victim was washing something in the kitchen, she turned around to see chan naked again, standing in front of the washing machine.  after they made eye contact, chan smiled and said he wanted to shower in the toilet.  furious, the victim scolded him.  the same act happened between september and october, while the victim was at the kitchen wash basin, prompting the victim to throw a bowl towards him. between 1 august and 20 september 2018, at around 6. 30am, the victim was leaving the flat when she turned around to see chan naked.  the victim then shouted at him, ""you pervert.  you like. . .  you enjoy letting people see, is it? then you should let everyone take a look at you. ""two audio recordings recorded by the victim and submitted to court captured an exchange between chan and the victim.  in one recording, the victim says, ""why did you don't wear your pant when you appeared behind me suddenly?"" chan is heard replying, ""you have not agreed to me for so long.  you see that fish, you think i can control myself.  when you don't give the fish to the cat, what do you think it will feel? i am a man, you think i am made of wood, is it? you don't have feeling, but i am a man, i have feeling?""after 30 december 2018, chan changed the lock of her bedroom door so that the victim was unable to lock the door.  the woman would then use a chair to block the door. in his defence, chan claimed that he was wearing his shorts at all times. the victim eventually reported the matter to the police on 23 december 2018.  when asked why she did not do so earlier, she said that she worried it would be troublesome as she was working here, and was concerned that the incident would affect her work permit. in finding chan guilty, district judge lau qiuyu described him as ""evasive"" and his evidence ""externally inconsistent"".  while chan initially argued that he was in a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship with the victim, he later claimed that they were just friends and he found acts of intimacy repulsive. dj lau added that she was unable to accept his claim that he did not intentionally expose himself to the woman.  chan had claimed that the exposure was accidental as the wind had blown open the toilet door while he was urinating.  for another incident, chan claimed that he had slipped on washing powder and that he hit himself, causing him to stroke his private parts in pain. when asked for his mitigation, chan said he had nothing to say.  he told the court that he was unable to pay the fine.  he will serve two weeks' jail in default of the fine.  stay in the know on-the-go: join yahoo singapore's telegram channel at http://t. me/yahoosingaporemore stories:of 25 new covid cases in singapore, 19 local including 1 dorm residentman who smuggled 3 dogs and 3 cats from pet shop in jb jailed 24 weekse-scooter, pab riders must pass online theory test from 1 jan 2022polestar, the premium electric vehicle maker owned by china's geely and volvo cars, will build its polestar 3 electric suv at volvo's u. s.  plant in south carolina starting in the second half of 2022, the brand's chief executive said.   the volvo plant in ridgeville, south carolina, near charleston, currently builds the volvo s60 sedan and will add the volvo xc90 suv in 2022, polestar said on wednesday. top news and what to watch in the markets on wednesday, june 16, 2021. have you considered how you'll withdraw your retirement income? these simple mistakes could cost you thousands of dollars. sterling scored in sunday's 1-0 win over croatia as england began the euros with a victory for the first time in nine attempts.   the manchester city forward, who was at the weekend awarded an mbe for his services to racial equality in sport, said meditation helped him feel relaxed.

""these hugely important findings confirm that the vaccines offer significant protection against hospitalisation from the delta variant,"" said ms mary ramsay, head of immunisation at phe. the phe findings follow a scottish study which showed that two doses of a covid-19 vaccine among people who tested positive cut their risk of hospitalisation by 70 per cent, although there were not enough hospital admissions reported to compare the vaccines. phe said that while further work was being undertaken to establish the level of protection against mortality from the delta variant, levels of protection against death were expected to be high. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-16,Some pharmacies see uptick in customers as sales of DIY COVID-19 antigen rapid test kits begin.,"singapore: pharmacies in singapore saw more customers coming in on wednesday (jun 16), the first day they began selling the covid-19 antigen rapid test (art) kits. at the guardian outlet in bedok mall, a few customers had bought the test kits within five minutes of the shop's opening at 10am, the in-store pharmacist told cna. the watsons' outlet at heartbeat@bedok also saw a ""fair bit"" of customers walking in to inquire about the kits when it opened, according to the company's customer director ms see seow ying. customers had to consult a pharmacist before purchasing them, as part of the ministry of health's guidelines.  the consultation includes asking if customers had any symptoms of covid-19 and if they had recently undergone facial surgery. the self-test kits are currently selling at 156 selected unity, watsons and guardian outlets across singapore.  they are priced between s$10 and s$13. 10, depending on the type and size of the pack purchased. a check by cna revealed that the price of the test kits varied across the three pharmacy brands.  for instance, at bedok mall, the abbott panbio covid-19 antigen self-test (1 kit) was selling for s$13. 10 at watsons' and s$12. 80 at guardian. nearby, at 212 bedok north street 1, the same brand of test kit was selling for s$12. 80 at unity. so far, only four self-test kits have been approved by the health sciences authority (hsa) for mass market use.  they are abbott panbio covid-19 antigen self-test, quickvue at-home otc covid-19 test, sd biosensor sars-cov-2 antigen self-test nasal and sd biosensor standard q covid-19 ag home test. these tests detect traces of the coronavirus by looking for virus proteins in the body and usually work best in the early stages of infection.  they are able to produce results in less than 20 minutes. in comparison, it can take up to 48 hours for pcr tests, as the samples have to be sent to laboratories to be tested. when cna visited various pharmacies in bedok and ang mo kio between 10am and 2pm, there was only a handful of customers who bought the test kits at each outlet.  shelves at the stores also appeared to be stocked with an ample supply of test kits. while most customers bought two to three test kits, ms see told cna that she observed a few customers buying 10 self-test kits, which is the maximum allowed under the moh guidelines. ""we have been advising customers to buy what they need and that there's no need to stock up excessively because we have got sufficient stock for everyone,"" she said. mr tan yong teck, who was at a watsons' outlet in bedok mall to buy the self-test kits, said having a supply of tests at home would make it more convenient for him and his family. ""we all have sensitive noses, so sometimes we can't differentiate whether it's just a sensitive nose or if we have symptoms of covid-19,"" said the 41-year-old it manager. ""there have been times where my kids had to stay home for a few days, while waiting for their results and in the end, nothing happened.

""the data out of the uk showing how quickly the delta variant became the dominant variant there is strong evidence that it is more transmissible than the alpha variant, which we already thought was more transmissible than the original lineages,"" said pekosz. the delta variant is spreading at an uncertain time in the us.  covid-19 cases have fallen far below the winter peak, from an average of more than 250,000 new diagnoses a day in january to about 14,000 a day in june.  fewer cases have coincided with fewer hospitalizations and deaths. this has led state after state to lift all social distancing guidelines, including in california, which gave the greenlight to large indoor gatherings such as sporting events.  now, social distancing and mask requirements are largely operating on the honor system. but, even as pandemic guidelines recede, delta has roughly doubled every two weeks in the us, a pattern once followed by alpha, the variant first discovered in the uk, which eventually came to represent the vast majority of new us infections.  the delta variant has also delayed the uk's planned reopening. according to the cdc, at the end of may alpha represented almost 70% of infections in the us.  but in mid-march, it represented only 26% of cases.  similarly, delta once represented only 2. 5% of cases of covid-19 by mid-may.  but two weeks prior to that, it represented only 1. 3% of cases.  again, two weeks before that in april, it represented just 0. 6% of cases. the doubling of cases has led some, such as the former food and drug administration (fda) commissioner dr scott gottlieb, to predict that delta may represent as much as 10% of us cases by mid-june. the cdc officially elevated delta to a ""variant of concern"" this week.  a ""variant of concern"" designation puts delta in the same category of increased surveillance as alpha and gamma (the variant first identified in brazil). the most serious designation for new strains are considered variants of ""high consequence"".  this designation implies significantly reduced vaccine efficacy, testing failures and more severe disease.  no variants circulating in the us meet this designation. part of scientists' concern with the delta variant is that a more transmissible virus can make social distancing less successful.  there are also concerns about severe localized outbreaks in an unevenly vaccinated nation.  the us has fully vaccinated 43. 9% of the population and 52. 6% have received at least one dose, according to the cdc.  however, those rates vary regionally. large swaths of the south have fully vaccinated less than 35% of their populations, such as in alabama, louisiana and tennessee.  by contrast, much of the north-east has fully vaccinated more than 50% of its population, including in vermont, maine, massachusetts, rhode island and new hampshire. vaccination rates also vary dramatically by age.  in the south, less than 10% of adolescents are vaccinated, in spite of being eligible for weeks, said dr peter hotez, a vaccine researcher and the dean of the national school of tropical medicine at baylor college. ""i've been saying [the] delta variant could rip through the south this summer, in which case [it] could hit unvaccinated young people pretty hard,"" hotez said on twitter.  those lower rates are, in part, tied to political polarization.  donald trump's followers listened as he blasted public health measures and workers during his tenure in the white house.  now, white evangelicals, republicans and people in rural america – all disproportionately likely to identify with trump – rank among the most likely to say they will ""definitely not"" get a vaccine. but lower vaccination rates in some states are also the result of weaker public health infrastructure.  people who have put off vaccines, but who are not necessarily opposed to getting one, reported they would be more likely to get a shot if they had time off work, transportation or their state provided financial incentives, kaiser family foundation found. further, it remains unclear whether delta will result in more serious disease.  a recent lancet study in scotland found people were twice as likely to be hospitalized by what was believed to be the delta variant compared to the alpha variant. however, the cdc has not said delta produced more serious outcomes, and pekosz said he believed it was too early to say whether delta resulted in more hospitalizations. what was reinforced by the lancet study is that vaccines remain effective against delta.  the mrna vaccine from pfizer offered ""very good"" protection.  a vaccine from astrazeneca had ""substantial but reduced"" efficacy against delta.  astrazeneca's vaccine uses a different technology, called viral vector, to induce an immune response. in the time it takes more americans to be fully vaccinated, roughly five to six weeks, the delta variant ""will be the majority of us cases,"" dr cyrus shahpar, an epidemiologist and covid-19 data director at the white house, said on twitter.  it is, ""important to start building protection now"". in turn, america's uneven vaccination status illustrates another, long-term problem – unvaccinated people may put pressure on the virus to evolve again. people ""who are vaccinated and people who are not vaccinated, the virus could be moving back and forth between those populations,"" pekosz said.  in turn, the virus could be evolving to, ""get around some of the immunity that is out there in the population"".

""antibody testing of blood samples helps us better understand the spread of sars-cov-2 in the us in the early days of the us epidemic, when testing was restricted,"" said lead author keri althoff, an associate professor of epidemiology at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health. the research builds on a similar investigation published by the centres for disease control and prevention last november that reached the same conclusion. but since there are uncertainties surrounding serology testing, further confirmation builds extra confidence in the finding. to help minimise the possibility of false positives, the team used two separate tests on each sample, searching for antibodies that bind to different parts of the virus. the types of antibodies they were looking for are called immunoglobulin g, or igg, which ""neutralise"" the virus' ability to invade cells and do not appear until two weeks after a person has been infected. it therefore follows that study participants with these samples were exposed to the virus at least several weeks earlier. limitations include that the number of samples taken from many states was low just a few dozen or hundred, the authors also do not know whether the participants became infected during travel, or within their own communities, and would like to see their work confirmed in further study. finally, there is a possibility that the antibodies they detected were formed against infection to other coronaviruses, such as the four that cause common colds. but since other research has shown that ""cross-reactivity"" between these coronaviruses is low, the team estimated that the probability all nine samples were false positives was one in 100,000. the us death toll from covid-19 surpassed 600,000 on tuesday, according to figures from johns hopkins university. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

that the coronavirus was present in the united states from at least december 2019, weeks before the first confirmed case was announced on jan 21. the national institutes of health study analysed 24,000 stored blood samples contributed by volunteers across the country from jan 2 to march 18, 2020. antibodies against the sars-cov-2 virus were detected via two different serology tests in nine patient samples, according to the paper, which was published in the journal clinical infectious diseases.', 'the participants were outside the major hotspots of seattle and new york city, thought to be the key entry points of the virus to the united states.', 'the first positive samples came from participants in illinois and massachusetts on jan 7 and 8, 2020, respectively, suggesting that the virus was present in those states in late december.', '""antibody testing of blood samples helps us better understand the spread of sars-cov-2 in the us in the early days of the us epidemic, when testing was restricted,"" said lead author keri althoff, an associate professor of epidemiology at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health.', 'the research builds on a similar investigation published by the centres for disease control and prevention last november that reached the same conclusion.', 'but since there are uncertainties surrounding serology testing, further confirmation builds extra confidence in the finding.', 'to help minimise the possibility of false positives, the team used two separate tests on each sample, searching for antibodies that bind to different parts of the virus.', 'the types of antibodies they were looking for are called immunoglobulin g, or igg, which ""neutralise"" the virus\' ability to invade cells and do not appear until two weeks after a person has been infected.', 'it therefore follows that study participants with these samples were exposed to the virus at least several weeks earlier.', 'limitations include that the number of samples taken from many states was low just a few dozen or hundred, the authors also do not know whether the participants became infected during travel, or within their own communities, and would like to see their work confirmed in further study.', 'finally, there is a possibility that the antibodies they detected were formed against infection to other coronaviruses, such as the four that cause common colds.', 'but since other research has shown that ""cross-reactivity"" between these coronaviruses is low, the team estimated that the probability all nine samples were false positives was one in 100,000. the us death toll from covid-19 surpassed 600,000 on tuesday, according to figures from johns hopkins university.', ""join st's telegram channel here and get the latest

2021-06-16,Seremban High Court to rule on challenge by Nora Anne's family today (June 16).,"
                    wednesday, 16 jun 2021
                kuala lumpur (afp): a malaysian court will rule wednesday (june 16) on a challenge by the family of a french-irish teenager over an inquest verdict that she died by misadventure after vanishing in the jungle. the body of nora anne quoirin (pic), a 15-year-old with learning difficulties, was discovered after a huge hunt through the rainforest following her disappearance from a resort outside kuala lumpur in 2019. in january, a coroner handed down a ruling of misadventure, indicating her death during the family holiday was accidental rather than a crime, and said no one else was involved. but her london-based parents, who have dismissed authorities' claims their daughter wandered into the jungle alone at night, and believe she was abducted, said they were ""utterly disappointed"" by the verdict. they lodged a challenge and are seeking to have the ruling revised to an open verdict suggesting there are still questions to be answered about the case. judge azizul azmi adnan is expected to hand down his ruling at 5pm (0900 gmt) at the high court in seremban via video-link because of coronavirus curbs. presenting the family's case at a hearing last week, lawyer louise azmi said an open verdict would be ""appropriate"". ""the last thing that (nora) would do is to walk away from the security of her parents,"" she said. malaysian police have stuck to their version of events that the teenager clambered out of a window of the family's holiday chalet and wandered off, and insist there was no sign of foul play. but her mother, meabh, has said she believes someone could have placed her body in the spot where it was found, not far from the resort. the teenager disappeared a day after her family checked in to the dusun resort, triggering a 10-day hunt involving hundreds of rescuers, helicopters and sniffer dogs. an autopsy concluded she likely died of starvation and internal bleeding. the coroner said the teenager had been left disoriented by the long journey from britain to malaysia, likely leading her to wander off, and that there was no sign she was murdered or sexually assaulted. the teen had a condition known as holoprosencephaly, where the brain fails to develop normally.  she had limited verbal communication and could only write a few words.  afp

2021-06-16,Playwright Alfian Sa'at questions PA's selective quoting of Sarah Bagharib's remarks in interview on Hari Raya standee fiasco.,"playwright alfian sa'at on tuesday night (15 june) questioned what appears to be the people's association (pa)'s selective quoting of communications specialist sarah bagharib's remarks in an interview with nanyang technological university professor walid j.  abdullah on the hari raya standee fiasco. pa had used ms sarah's wedding photograph as a prop in its hari raya aidilfitri display at an hdb estate in tiong bahru.  while the standee was subsequently removed and the pa offered her a public apology, the organisation later said it rejects ms sarah's ""accusations"" of racism, branding the incident ""culturally insensitive"" and an ""isolated case"". posting on facebook on monday, pa referenced her interview with assistant professor walid, claiming that ms sarah mentioned that the incident has perpetuated a culture of racism. ""it is not right to raise the allegation of racism, without basis, to stoke emotions and sentiments,"" said pa. the organisation claimed that it had explained to ms sarah that while it acknowledges that its staff ""should have been more culturally sensitive"", it is not right to paint ""sweeping conclusions from this incident"". doubling down on its point that ms sarah's case was an isolated one, pa said that it finds ms sarah's public call for messages or suggestions that they would like to have relayed to the organisation in their meeting an ""odd"" one. ""we do not see why our meeting should be appropriated as a platform for her to funnel the views and comments of persons unrelated to the incident,"" said pa, adding that it is of the view that ms sarah's purpose in agreeing to meet its representatives ""has gone far beyond the radin mas incident"". pa said that it will not be following through with the meeting as there is ""no point"" in doing so, in light of the above. ""we agree it is important for our staff and volunteers to be sensitive to and knowledgeable about the cultures of all our ethnic groups.  we are now looking at establishing a resource panel to guide and advise our staff on cultural matters.  we will also step up training efforts to enhance staff and volunteers' understanding and appreciation of our different cultures,"" it added. pa also claimed that ms sarah's 1 june email had falsely alleged that it was ""hasty in sharing the name of the vendor"" in order to ""distance and deflect blame"" from itself. ""the vendor had identified himself directly to ms sarah on 28 may, and apologised.  this was before pa issued our statement on 29 may,"" it said. ""it is regrettable that ms sarah did not clarify this point during her instagram live interview with mr walid j.  abdullah on 7 june.  instead she persisted in conveying the impression that pa had deflected blame from itself,"" pa added. the short length of the quotes attached by pa in its follow-up post, said mr alfian, had aroused his suspicion, as ""to build a case against someone it is always important to be able to reproduce what they said in full"". ""scanning through pa's statement, one would be forgiven if one thought that ms sarah was the one who made the claim that what pa did ""perpetuate[d] [a] racist culture"".  but she was actually sharing something someone else had written,"" he noted. ms sarah had in fact quoted a female chinese clinical psychologist's comment, who wrote:""this whole thread is written with much labour, can we chinese singaporeans please appreciate the labour and educate ourselves on our conditioned racism? it's long overdue towards our friends in minority communities who have to put up with our ignorance–which continues to perpetuate the racist culture that hurts them. ""the comment in itself did not state that the act of putting up the offending decorations in itself had perpetuated a culture of racism — rather, it is the cultural ignorance in the process of doing so that is racist, said mr alfian. ms sarah, he added, did not directly make remarks such as ""this racist incident"" or ""and other similar racist incidents"" in the interview. instead, she said:""allyship plays a big part in promoting true racial harmony–one that goes beyond ""racial tolerance"".  i am so, so grateful to allies who have used their voices to stand in solidarity with razif and i, and ethnic minority communities, in the aftermath of this incident (and other racist attacks and incidents that have been filmed). """"i think ms sarah has been at pains to assert that all singaporeans, and not just minorities, are stakeholders in the issue.  hers isn't some kind of minority grievance whose aim is to indict an entire majority community,"" said mr alfian. referencing pa's claim that its error was not born out of racism, but rather out of ""cultural insensitivity"", the playwright said that the model of ""racial harmony"" that the organisation has been operating on ""would not recognise that something is racist unless it ""disrupts"" harmony"". ""of course the people at pa would want to distance themselves from ""obvious"" racists like beow tan, tan boon lee and the gong lady,"" he said, adding that pleading ""cultural insensitivity"" is a way of justifying ""racism that is not tantamount to public nuisance"". addressing pa's claim that ms sarah had spoken about its ""staff and volunteers"" being ""blind to racism"", mr alfian said that he could not find the alleged statement anywhere in the whole interview. ""what i found instead was this, 9 minutes from the end.  walid jokes with her about whether she'd have a teh tarik with melvin yong (the mp on the banner),"" he said. quoting ms sarah:""there was a light-up event, at tiong bahru arcade, where the standee was as well, and i wonder if he saw it? there was a light up hari raya event, at that very stage.  with his face, and the kampung thing, coconut tree and all of it.  so i wondered if he saw the standee, what he thought about it.  if he did, and he didn't say anything, or think twice, to think that something was wrong about it.  if i had teh tarik with him then i'd like to know if he did see that.  and if he did, and he didn't say anything about it, then something is definitely wrong, right?while there was a comment on internalised racism — on how ""we've been so conditioned to think in a certain way. . . that there's nothing wrong with this because people are colour blind, or blind to racism at play.  or there's nothing wrong, because it doesn't impact them"" — mr alfian noted that there was ""no mention of pa staff or volunteers"". ""it's a stretch, but maybe she was questioning whether the mp had noticed that something was wrong–and it's important to underline that these are questions, not accusations,"" he said. the playwright questioned whether much of the supposed efforts on those who speak of ""racial harmony"" are mostly concentrated on the ""in progress"" part than in doing ""the actual work"". ""because for me, one of the most important work is dialogue–real dialogue with those on the other side of the aisle, not stage-managed ones of vetted questions and screened guest lists.  i dream of the day when pa can have a dialogue with ms sarah, or when zaobao editors can have one with the scholars who wrote in to them on their coverage of racial issues.  it's a dream that's entirely within reach,"" he said. professor walid, in his comment on mr alfian's post, highlighted that ms sarah was ""responding to a comment"" left by a viewer during the livestream ""when she talked about internalised racism"". ""because ig live does not save comments, and we were taking many comments, we do not even know what that specific comment refers to,"" he added. other commenters remarked that pa staff involved in the saga ""need to take a critical reading class"" and that by ""unilaterally cancelling a planned meeting"" with ms sarah, the organisation is ""essentially indicating that they do not want to do the hard work of authentic dialogue"".  one of the ""smear campaigns constructed out of selective quotations"" referred to by mr alfian in his post earlier include pro-establishment factions such as facebook page singapore matters citing his social media post from 2012, in which mr alfian had reportedly told today that he ""would love to become a malaysian"". in june last year, mr alfian also had to issue a refutation against the ""pro-malaysia activist"" narrative made against him. among the points made by mr alfian include his past criticism in 2014 on how the bumiputera policy ""has been hijacked and corrupted"" by ""umnoputras"" through ""cronyism, nepotism and corruption"". ""of all the accusations in that post, this one is the most obviously defamatory.  i had to comb through all my posts to see what i had written about 'bumiputera policies'.  and there's not a single post that mentions endorsement of the policy, nor my wish for it to be implemented in singapore.  if anything, there is awareness of how it has been hijacked and corrupted,"" he wrote. touching on the claim that he had ""mocked"" singapore's approach in the maritime dispute with malaysia in 2019 as ""jingoism"", mr alfian clarified that his comments expressed his ""dovish"" anxiety over military escalation in the johor straits at the time. ""i expect our elected officials to exhaust all diplomatic channels for solutions rather than to rely on 'jingoism'—extreme nationalism, in the form of aggressive or warlike foreign policy,"" he wrote. in his commentary on his poem ""singapore you are not my country"", mr alfian highlighted that then-education minister ong ye kung did not quote the poem in full when the latter cited it in parliament in october 2019. in delivering his speech on the cancellation of a yale-nus programme which mr alfian was initially invited to run, mr ong quoted part of mr alfian's poem ""singapore you are not my country"", which was written in 1998, to give parliament ""a flavour"" of the literary figure's ""thinking"". mr ong said:""singapore, i assert you are not a country at all,
do not raise your voice against me, i am not afraid of your anthem""later part of the poem says:"". . . how can you call yourself a country,
you terrible hallucination of highways and cranes and condominiums
ten minutes' drive from the mrt?""""this is a poem, and we might concede some artistic licence.  but mr alfian sa'at continues this attitude consistently in his activism. ""mr alfian in a facebook post later clarified that the line quoted by mr ong, when placed in context, appears as seen below:do not raise your voice against me,
i am not afraid of your anthem
although the lyrics are still bleeding from
the bark of my sapless heart. mr alfian elaborated that the context in which the line ""i am not afraid of your anthem"" appears describes the anthem's presence in his upbringing as a singaporean and how it ""bleeds from my heart"". contrary to what the line appears to suggest on the surface, 'i am not afraid of your anthem' actually reveals the fear of vulnerability and of having the anthem ""rouse patriotic feelings in me"", he added. ""i am afraid of this patriotic love because it is so involuntarily, it comes from a primordial and irresistible place from deep inside,"" said mr alfian.  ""i am afraid of these volcanic feelings because i want to protect myself from loving something too much. """"just stopping on the word 'anthem' might suggest that i am somehow rejecting symbols of the state,"" he said. the aforementioned yale-nus programme, which was renamed ""dialogue and dissent in singapore"", was originally set to take place from 29 september to 5 october in 2019. contrary to the allegations made in a yale report on the cancellation, which he said painted him as ""defiant and intransigent"", mr alfian said that he was open to removing certain elements from the original programme itinerary and substituting such elements with others, in light of sensitivities arising from contemporary developments at the time. an example of such, according to mr alfian, included removing the screening of a documentary on hong kong civil rights activist joshua wong after a yale-nus representative – who he addressed as ""person d"" – on 11 sep raised concerns pertaining to the ongoing protests in the city.  © 2006 2021 the online citizen© 2006 2021 the online

and the pa offered her a public apology, the organisation later said it rejects ms sarah\'s ""accusations"" of racism, branding the incident ""culturally insensitive"" and an ""isolated case"".', 'posting on facebook on monday, pa referenced her interview with assistant professor walid, claiming that ms sarah mentioned that the incident has perpetuated a culture of racism.', '""it is not right to raise the allegation of racism, without basis, to stoke emotions and sentiments,"" said pa. the organisation claimed that it had explained to ms sarah that while it acknowledges that its staff ""should have been more culturally sensitive"", it is not right to paint ""sweeping conclusions from this incident"".', 'doubling down on its point that ms sarah\'s case was an isolated one, pa said that it finds ms sarah\'s public call for messages or suggestions that they would like to have relayed to the organisation in their meeting an ""odd"" one.', '""we do not see why our meeting should be appropriated as a platform for her to funnel the views and comments of persons unrelated to the incident,"" said pa, adding that it is of the view that ms sarah\'s purpose in agreeing to meet its representatives ""has gone far beyond the radin mas incident"".', 'pa said that it will not be following through with the meeting as there is ""no point"" in doing so, in light of the above.', '""we agree it is important for our staff and volunteers to be sensitive to and knowledgeable about the cultures of all our ethnic groups.', 'we are now looking at establishing a resource panel to guide and advise our staff on cultural matters.', 'we will also step up training efforts to enhance staff and volunteers\' understanding and appreciation of our different cultures,"" it added.', 'pa also claimed that ms sarah\'s 1 june email had falsely alleged that it was ""hasty in sharing the name of the vendor"" in order to ""distance and deflect blame"" from itself.', '""the vendor had identified himself directly to ms sarah on 28 may, and apologised.', 'this was before pa issued our statement on 29 may,"" it said.', '""it is regrettable that ms sarah did not clarify this point during her instagram live interview with mr walid j.  abdullah on 7 june.', 'instead she persisted in conveying the impression that pa had deflected blame from itself,"" pa added.', 'the short length of the quotes attached by pa in its follow-up post, said mr alfian, had aroused his suspicion, as ""to build a case against someone it is always important to be able to reproduce what they said in full"".', '""scanning through pa\'s statement, one would be forgiven if one thought that ms sarah was the one who made the claim that what pa did ""perpetuate[d] [a] racist culture"".', 'but she was actually sharing something someone else had written,"" he noted.', 'ms sarah had in fact quoted a female chinese clinical psychologist\'s comment, who wrote:""this whole thread is written with much labour, can we chinese singaporeans please appreciate the labour and educate ourselves on our conditioned racism?', ""it's long overdue towards our friends in minority communities who have to put up with our ignorance–which continues to perpetuate the racist culture that hurts them."", '""the comment in itself did not state that the act of putting up the offending decorations in itself had perpetuated a culture of racism — rather, it is the cultural ignorance in the process of doing so that is racist, said mr alfian.', 'ms sarah, he added, did not directly make remarks such as ""this racist incident"" or ""and other similar racist incidents"" in the interview.', 'instead, she said:""allyship plays a big part in promoting true racial harmony–one that goes beyond ""racial tolerance"".', 'i

incidents that have been filmed).', '""""i think ms sarah has been at pains to assert that all singaporeans, and not just minorities, are stakeholders in the issue.', 'hers isn\'t some kind of minority grievance whose aim is to indict an entire majority community,"" said mr alfian.', 'referencing pa\'s claim that its error was not born out of racism, but rather out of ""cultural insensitivity"", the playwright said that the model of ""racial harmony"" that the organisation has been operating on ""would not recognise that something is racist unless it ""disrupts"" harmony"".', '""of course the people at pa would want to distance themselves from ""obvious"" racists like beow tan, tan boon lee and the gong lady,"" he said, adding that pleading ""cultural insensitivity"" is a way of justifying ""racism that is not tantamount to public nuisance"".', 'addressing pa\'s claim that ms sarah had spoken about its ""staff and volunteers"" being ""blind to racism"", mr alfian said

""the actual work"".', '""because for me, one of the most important work is dialogue–real dialogue with those on the other side of the aisle, not stage-managed ones of vetted questions and screened

added.', 'other commenters remarked that pa staff involved in the saga ""need to take a critical reading class"" and that by ""unilaterally cancelling a planned meeting"" with ms sarah, the

alfian in his post earlier include pro-establishment factions such as facebook page singapore matters citing his social media post from 2012, in which mr alfian had reportedly told today that he ""would love to become a malaysian"".', 'in june last year, mr alfian also had to issue a refutation against the ""pro-malaysia activist"" narrative made against him.', 'among the points made by mr

your anthem"" appears describes the anthem\'s presence in his upbringing as a singaporean and how it ""bleeds from my heart"".', 'contrary to what the line appears to suggest on the surface, \'i am

""the incident occurred when the store was being opened for the day by its store assistant,"" said the spokesman. the store assistant suffered some cuts and first-aid was immediately rendered by ion staff.  ""we are in touch with the bobbi brown staff and the management, and will render additional support to them as necessary,"" the spokesman added. a spokesman for scdf said that it received a call for assistance at ion orchard at about 11. 10am, and later took a person to the singapore general hospital. before the incident, retail staff at ion orchard were seen busy tidying up their wares and preparing their storefronts in anticipation of shoppers returning after a four-day closure for deep cleaning and disinfection. the mall was ordered to close from last saturday to tuesday by the ministry of health, after a number of covid-19 cases were linked to it. on wednesday, the mall, which has 400 retailers, reopened its doors at 10am.  at some stores, staff were seen dusting their display shelves and racks. but not all stores were ready to welcome customers by 11am.  british luxury fashion house burberry and japanese department store muji were among those that remained shuttered. in a circular to tenants on wednesday, ion orchard said only shops whose staff have all been swabbed and tested negative are allowed to reopen. it added: ""you are expected to make the necessary arrangements to begin your operations and ensure the stores are manned accordingly.

she decided to pop by the mall as she was in the area.  she was not aware that ion orchard had been closed for four days owing to covid-19. ""but i'm not worried.  singapore has a certain standard of cleanliness and obviously they want business to come back, so they would put in effort to maintain that standard,"" she said. another shopper who wanted to be known only as mr koda, 41, also dropped by the mall to buy a pair of shoes for his two-year-old son.  he, too, was not concerned about the recent covid-19 cases linked to the mall. ""if anything, this would be the cleanest place in singapore after all that cleaning,"" said mr koda, who works in the energy sector. ""and singapore does a good job of cleaning, so i'm not worried,"" he added. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

""a while back, i encountered the corpse of a missing person while diving,"" he said.  ""that is definitely up there with the crazy stories.

2021-06-16,"MAS reprimands insurers for breaching rules on risk management, commission payments, Business News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore four financial institutions were reprimanded by the monetary authority of singapore (mas) for breaching rules over commission payments. aia financial advisers (aia fa), prudential assurance company singapore (prudential), and aviva, along with its wholly owned subsidiary aviva financial advisers (aviva fa), were found to have breached risk management and supervisor remuneration regulations, the central bank said on tuesday (june 15). mas also reprimanded mr peter tan shou yi, a consultant engaged by aviva, for accepting remuneration in breach of regulatory requirements, and aviva fa's chief executive and director, mr lionel chee boon chai, for his failure to discharge the duties of his office. mr tan and his company, peter tan organisation management and consultancy, were sued in 2019 by prudential for up to $2. 5 billion for allegedly ""surreptitiously"" orchestrating a mass defection to aviva's subsidiary, aviva financial advisers, in mid-2016. in may 2021, the high court found he had breached his agency agreement in soliciting the defection. an mas spokesman said a reprimand registers the authority's serious concerns regarding the misconduct by a financial institution (fi).  ""the fis and individuals are required to remediate the issues promptly.  mas may also take the reprimands into account when considering action to be taken against the fis/individuals for any future contraventions,"" the spokesman said. in deciding on the appropriate enforcement action, mas will consider all the circumstances of the case, including the seriousness of the misconduct, the impact of the misconduct on customers or the financial sector, and any remediation action taken. mas said that following indications of rule violations by the insurers, it conducted an investigation and found numerous instances where remuneration was paid to supervisors in contravention of requirements under the financial advisers act (faa). indications of violations may emerge from a whistle-blower, a complaint by a customer or during the course of regular on-site checks conducted by regulators. these violations were related to the balanced scorecard requirements (bsc) for the sale of investment products, and the spreading and capping of commissions rules (scc) for the sale of regular premium life policies. the bsc and scc seek to align the incentives of financial adviser (fa) firms, agents and supervisors with their customers' interests, to promote a culture of fair dealing. under the bsc, supervisors' and agents' variable incomes are determined with reference to the fulfilment of non-sales key performance indicators (kpis), such as whether an agent has taken steps to understand the customer's needs, recommend suitable products and make adequate disclosures.  the aim is to raise the quality of advice and to mitigate risks of product pushing and pressure sales tactics. under the scc, which applies to the sale of regular premium life policies to individuals, insurers and fa firms are required to cap the variable income payable to agents and supervisors in the first year and spread the remaining variable income payable over a prescribed period. the rule addresses concerns that an agent who has received most of his total variable income upfront may not be incentivised to provide quality after-sales services to his clients. narrating its investigation and its findings, mas said three of aia fa's managing directors (mds) had acted as supervisors of aia fa.  they were responsible for the supervision of the conduct and performance of the agents in their respective agency groups, including sales and compliance standards. however, aia fa failed to review and assess the performance of these mds, assign bsc grades as well as determine and pay their remuneration in accordance with the bsc. aia fa also failed to cap and spread the mds' variable income in accordance with the scc. 
mas also reprimanded mr peter tan shou yi (left), a consultant engaged by aviva, and aviva fa's chief executive and director, mr lionel chee boon chai.  photos: st file, avivafa. com. sg
the mas investigation found that mr tan, engaged by aviva as a consultant from july 2016 to march 2020, went beyond providing strategic advice and acted as a supervisor to aviva fa's agents. while mr tan from july 2016 to april 2019 had frequent and direct interactions with aviva fa's agents, including discussions on sales and compliance issues, neither aviva nor aviva fa had put in place compliance arrangements to monitor his activities in aviva fa. hence, aviva contravened the guidelines on risk management practices internal controls (rm guidelines) and aviva fa contravened the financial advisers regulations.  at prudential, three individuals referred to as master group agency manager (mgam) leaders and a consultant appointed by the firm had acted as supervisors. however, prudential failed to review and assess the performance of the mgam leaders and the consultant, assign bsc grades to them, as well as determine and pay their remuneration in accordance with the bsc. prudential also breached the rm guidelines as it failed to put in place adequate risk mitigation procedures and compliance arrangements to monitor the activities of the mgam leaders and consultant. ms ho hern shin, mas' deputy managing director for financial supervision, said: ""mas expects financial institutions to have robust arrangements to ensure that their agents place their customers' interests first. ""she noted that mas' requirements on remuneration practices relating to the sale of investment and life insurance products aim to promote good sales conduct in the financial advisory industry. ""we have dealt firmly with these financial institutions and individuals who have breached our regulations, to send a clear message to the industry on the importance of upholding high ethical standards,"" she said. according to mas, all financial institutions are expected to put in place appropriate compliance arrangements to ensure that they comply with all applicable laws and rules and to mitigate the risks of non-compliance. the rm guidelines provide guidance to financial institutions on sound and prudent internal control practices. fa firms are also required under regulation 14 of the financial advisers regulations to put in place compliance arrangements to ensure they comply with the applicable legal and regulatory requirements.  effective compliance arrangements help protect customers' interests and reduce the possibility of unexpected losses or damage. the mas spokesman said: ""in respect of the impact to customers, mas has not found evidence of direct harm to customers as a result of the fis' failure to adhere to the bsc and scc requirements. ""nevertheless, the failures are viewed seriously because the bsc and scc requirements are intended to align the interests of financial advisory firms, supervisors and representatives with those of their customers, and promote a culture of fair dealing.  non-compliance with the requirements therefore increases the risk that customers' interests could be prejudiced. ""the spokesman pointed out that the poor conduct of the aviva fa agents included misrepresentations to customers regarding the features and benefits of certain life insurance products. mas has required aviva to conduct investigations, take disciplinary action against the agents concerned, and provide remediation for the affected customers, which the firm has done.  ""where breaches of mas' regulations are established, mas will take appropriate regulatory action,"" the spokesman said. an aviva singapore spokesman said the lapses identified by mas occurred before the sale of aviva singapore to a consortium led by singapore life, which was completed in november 2020. 
 
since then, aviva said, it has made leadership changes to strengthen management effectiveness and accelerate culture change. ""following the transaction, the newly constituted board has invested significant time and resources to address the underlying issues.  we have strengthened our controls to prevent the recurrence of such issues, and these are being validated by an independent external auditor,"" the spokesman said. ""we will ensure we hold ourselves to high standards on regulatory compliance. "" prudential singapore said in a statement: ""we will work closely with mas to further enhance our controls in relation to the balanced scorecard framework and accompanying risk management measures, in view of resolving the issues raised so we can continue to provide the highest standard of service to our customers.

""i am not privy to discuss all these cases in court here without causing embarrassment or being prejudicial to the saf and to the government of singapore. . .  (i) am applying for all these charges to be dropped,"" she said. ""due to all these cases in the past, i should be granted immunity as a citizen. ""judge wang replied that the earlier cases are not relevant to her current set of charges. [[nid:530394]]at an earlier hearing on may 25, the court ordered that phoon be remanded at the institute of mental health for two weeks for psychiatric assessment. arguing against the order at the time, phoon also said she was a former naval officer, with a history of good conduct. she added that she had returned from holiday and was unaware of the laws requiring her to wear a mask. she first appeared in court last year after she allegedly failed to wear a mask over her nose and mouth ""at all times"" at newton hawker centre between 7. 20pm and 8pm on may 8 during the circuit breaker period. she left singapore for britain soon after that alleged offence.  she returned to singapore on june 28 last year and had to serve a 14-day stay-home notice at mbs until july 12. the court earlier heard that she allegedly left her hotel room at mbs between 8. 07pm and 8. 23pm on june 28. [[nid:532027]]phoon is said to have loitered around various places in the hotel and is accused of failing to wear a mask while doing so. following this, she allegedly failed to wear a mask in public places on multiple occasions between dec 2 last year and may 24 this year, at mbs and outside the state courts building, as well as at clarke quay central and bras basah complex. she was arrested on may 25 this year. on tuesday, her case was adjourned to july 6.  she remains out on bail of $8,000.  first-time offenders who breach laws under the covid-19 (temporary measures) act can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to $10,000. repeat offenders can be jailed for up to a year and fined up to $20,000. this article was first published in the straits times.  permission required for reproduction.

2021-06-16,"Taiwanese flying to US, China for vaccines as island's Covid-19 situation worsens, East Asia News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. taipei mr miles hu plans to get his covid-19 vaccination in the united states later this month, joining other anxious taiwanese who are seeking the jabs elsewhere because of the slow rate of vaccination at home. ""i'm pretty sure taiwan won't have enough vaccines for everyone until year-end, so i decided to combine a work trip with the vaccination,"" said the 40-year-old who manages tech investments. mr hu told the straits times that he will be travelling to los angeles, and plans to book an appointment to get vaccinated at a pharmacy near his airbnb lodging. many american states do not require residency for free covid-19 vaccines. while mr hu believes that taiwan has ""done a very good job, better than the vast majority of places"", with its covid-19 measures in the past year, he says the government never had a solid plan to ensure that there were enough vaccines for the population of 23. 7 million. after largely keeping covid-19 contained for a little over a year, infections in taiwan have grown 10-fold in the past month.  the island reported 135 cases on tuesday (june 15) and eight deaths, bringing the total to 13,241 cases and 460 fatalities. taiwan has ordered some 20 million shots from moderna, astrazeneca and the covax global sharing scheme for lower-income places.  but the imports have been arriving in small batches that are barely enough for high-risk groups like medical workers and their families. the island has so far received only 726,600 doses of the astrazeneca vaccine and another 150,000 doses of the moderna vaccine. health minister chen shih-chung said on may 29 that the government aims to have at least 60 per cent of the population receive their first jabs by october. earlier this month, japan donated 1. 24 million astrazeneca doses to taiwan and the us has promised to donate 750,000 shots. but with only some 3 per cent of the population vaccinated as at last week, many are getting worried or frustrated, while at the same time, struggling to adapt to a soft lockdown schools as well as entertainment and recreation facilities are shut, and working from home is encouraged. those who have foreign citizenship are the luckier ones.  ms winnie huang and her partner, both taiwanese who also hold us citizenship, flew to taiwan in early may 2020, when covid-19 cases were skyrocketing in the us. ""i feel lucky to be able to travel to taiwan while the rest of the world is under lockdown,"" said 27-year-old ms huang. the couple were able to work remotely for a year, and flew back to the us in late april to get vaccinated just when a string of local cluster infections broke out in northern taipei. as taiwan continues to extend its second-highest alert level, talk of ""vaccine tour groups"" spread quickly online. according to local media, screenshots of messages detailing the itinerary of a ""21-day pfizer tour"" were leaked to reporters in late may.  the itinerary began on june 1 in los angeles, taking the tour group to get their first jab on june 2, and touring las vegas, san francisco, san diego before the second dose back in los angeles.  the trip reportedly cost nt$350,000 (s$16,800). the government quickly announced that such tours are illegal, and agencies will be fined up to nt$150,000 and potentially be stripped of their licence. some taiwanese have also headed to china for their jabs.  china has opened up vaccination to those from taiwan, hong kong, macau and other places in the world, but people from taiwan will have faster access through ""green channels"", said mr xu zhen-wen, a taiwanese businessman in china. the head of a taiwan business association on the mainland said after their two-week quarantine in china, taiwanese people can register for free vaccination through an app or at the local taiwan affairs office chapter. once approved, they can get their free jabs at ""green channels"" set up in hospitals, clinics, and vaccination centres across china, ""as a way to fast-track vaccination procedures for taiwanese in china"", said mr xu. mr kao ren-mao, 42, and his wife flew to shanghai in may to get vaccinated.  they received their first jab of china's sinopharm vaccine last thursday and are waiting for their second one.

mr kao told the straits times that he knows at least a dozen more taiwanese who opted to do the same, complaining that ""the taiwanese government is taking too long to vaccinate everyone"". ""i wanted to bring the whole family but most of them couldn't leave work for over a month,"" said mr kao, who works for a transportation company based in china's hefei city, but has been working remotely in taiwan for a year. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-16,The strategy behind Marjorie Taylor Greene’s apology.,"the development no one saw comingfind your bookmarks in your independent premium section, under my profilefind your bookmarks in your independent premium section, under my profilecongress greene holocauston the surface, she did everything she was supposed to do.  she made a stupid (very, very stupid) comment; she educated herself on the community she insulted; she apologized without a ""sorry, but"" in sight.  ""one of the best lessons that my father always taught me was when you make a mistake you should own it,"" said marjorie taylor greene, standing outside the capitol early this week.  ""and i have made a mistake . . .  so i definitely want to own it.

""did you target civilians? did you kill them willingly, knowing they were civilians? obviously, the answer is no,"" he said. that being the case, he argued, the ""extrajudicial killings"" that resulted from the drug war could not be considered ""crimes against humanity"". in one of her last acts before she steps down as chief prosecutor of the international criminal court (icc) this week, ms fatou bensouda has sought a full investigation into mr duterte's purported crimes against humanity in a drug war that has left thousands dead since he took office in 2016. ""i have determined that there is a reasonable basis to believe that the crime against humanity of murder has been committed. . .  in the context of the government of the philippines' 'war on drugs' campaign,"" she said in a statement. in her 57-page report to the icc's judges, ms bensouda said ""there is a reasonable basis to believe"" that security forces and state-sanctioned ""vigilantes"" killed between 12,000 and 30,000 drug suspects from july 1, 2016, to march 16, 2019. she said security officials ""paid police officers and vigilantes bounties"" to execute people suspected of being involved in the drug trade. ""state officials at the highest levels of government also spoke publicly and repeatedly in support of extrajudicial killings and created a culture of impunity for those who committed them,"" she added. she said the investigation should include allegations of torture and other ""inhumane acts"" dating as far back as 2011, when mr duterte was mayor of davao city. human rights activists called ms bensouda's decision a step towards holding mr duterte accountable. it is a ""much-awaited step"" in putting an end to ""murderous incitement by president duterte and his administration"", amnesty international's secretary-general agnes callamard said. ""the icc's intervention must end this cycle of impunity in the country and send a signal to the police and those with links to the police who continue to carry out or sanction these killings that they cannot escape being held accountable for the crimes they commit,"" she said. the international coalition for human rights in the philippines said it is ""a positive step that may help bring some measure of justice to the thousands victimised and terrorised by the duterte regime"". it called on the united nations human rights council to begin its own probe into mr duterte's human rights record. mr duterte was elected to office in 2016 on a campaign promise to get rid of the country's drug problem, openly exhorting the police to kill drug suspects. but he has repeatedly denied links to the killings, insisting that most resulted from rivalries among drug gangs. he has also backed police accounts that most of those killed were on ""drug watch lists"" and that they had been armed and resisted arrest. while ms bensouda concluded that as many as 30,000 had been killed, the latest official data showed that just 6,000 suspects had died in more than 200,000 anti-drug operations. the philippines officially withdrew from the icc in 2019 on mr duterte's orders after multiple complaints were filed against him. ms bensouda, however, said previous cases showed that ""the court retains jurisdiction over crimes that are alleged to have occurred on the territory of that state during the period when it was a state party"" to the icc. but mr roque insisted that the icc lacked jurisdiction in the philippines: ""we are no longer a member of the icc. ""he said that the court could not intervene as long as the philippines had ""independent and competent courts"" that were already investigating the killings. ""the icc will not exercise jurisdiction unless the state is unable and unwilling to prosecute. . .  this is not the case in the philippines,"" he said. should the court decide to probe him for war crimes, mr duterte would ""never cooperate"" as long as he is president, mr roque added. he said the icc should also not allow itself to be used by mr duterte's political enemies harbouring ambitions of higher office. he said that among those who filed complaints to the icc was former senator antonio trillanes, a former soldier and fierce critic of mr duterte who has announced his intention to run for president next year. the icc's judges have up to four months to issue a decision on ms bensouda's request.  but pursuing it would be up to ms bensouda's successor, mr karim khan, who is to be sworn in today. in a statement, the philippines' foreign ministry said ms bensouda's ""midnight announcement"" has tied mr khan's hands. the ministry added that ms bensouda has ""undercut the attractiveness"" of joining the icc for some countries. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-16,"Days off, free medical consultations: Companies roll out support for employees taking COVID-19 vaccine.","singapore: as singapore begins to vaccinate younger age groups against covid-19, some companies have introduced measures to encourage employees to get their jabs and to support those who may suffer side effects. the registration exercise for singaporeans aged 12 to 39 began on jun 11.  this is a big group of about 1. 5 million people, health minister ong ye kung had said. beyond giving employees time off to get vaccinated, companies cna spoke to said they have other support initiatives in place. at singtel, for instance, employees are entitled to sick leave on the day of vaccination.  they can also work from home for a week after if they feel unwell, said the company's chief human resources officer aileen tan. employees are also covered under the company's insurance plan, which defrays the cost of medical expenses for any sickness or disability resulting from the vaccination, said ms tan.  she added that singtel also invited infectious diseases expert dr leong hoe nam to clarify any doubts staff members may have about the vaccine. more than 90 per cent of singtel employees in frontline roles, such as retail staff and field engineers, are fully vaccinated, said ms tan. at ocbc bank, employees taking the vaccine are given a day off for each appointment, as well as private taxi reimbursement to and from the vaccination centres. if they experience side effects, they may take an additional two days of medical leave without needing to provide a medical certificate.  the company will reimburse any medical consultation fees as well, said mr ernest phang, head of corporate services under group human resources. ""for those who decided to go ahead with (getting vaccinated), we will provide the necessary support to them because we understand the anxiety and stress that comes from having to make such a decision,"" he added. similarly at uob, those who suffer side effects can tap the company's appointed panel of clinics for free medical consultation.  they also have life and health insurance that covers covid-19 infection and vaccination side effects. ""those who feel unwell after the vaccination are advised to consult a doctor immediately and to be on medical leave as advised by the doctor,"" said head of group human resources dean tong. the side effects of the covid-19 vaccine include fever, chills, headaches, joint pain and tiredness. ""most side effects are mild or moderate, and usually get better within a few days,"" said the ministry of health. according to the us centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), side effects after the second shot may be more intense than after the first dose. in addition, younger people are more likely to experience side effects compared to older people, said the cdc. to allow employees to obtain online approval for essential facility visits and report covid-19 cases, sembcorp industries has come up with an app that was developed in-house. ""with the health and safety of our employees as our top priority in this pandemic, sembcorp has introduced a covid-19 app for employees to obtain online approval for essential facility visits, as well as to report cases,"" a spokesperson said. the app also allows employees to provide voluntary updates on their vaccination status. companies cna spoke to stressed that it is important for employees to rest if they don't feel well after vaccination. ""in the event that (employees) feel unwell after their vaccination, we encourage them to take ample rest to recover,"" said an ntuc fairprice spokesperson, adding that as frontline workers, its employees were given priority for vaccination earlier this year. ""fairprice encourages all staff to be vaccinated, and to allay any concerns as well as to address queries, we invite medical experts to conduct online talks so that staff are better informed on the benefits of vaccination.

2021-06-16,"India’s second COVID-19 wave sparks selfless acts, but the battle is far from over.","with hospitals pushed to the limit, good samaritans have stepped forward to save lives.  but beating the second wave — and preventing a third — will take a lot more, experts tell the programme insight. mumbai: people feared they would die if they stepped out of their homes.  in the streets, people were weeping beside the dead.  oxygen and hospital beds were in dire shortage. as new cases in india exceeded 400,000 and deaths exceeded 4,000 on some days last month, even the rich and connected were not spared from the devastating second wave of the covid-19 pandemic. but the virus did not kill the spirit of generosity. in mumbai, kidney dialysis patient rozy saldhana and her husband had basic medical facilities including an oxygen cylinder set up at home for emergencies.  despite her kidney failure, the 52-year-old did not hesitate to give the cylinder to someone else who needed it. her husband, pascol, had received a call from his friend, a school principal.  the husband of a teacher needed oxygen but could not get hold of a cylinder. watch: in india, dialysis patient saves dying covid-19 victims (3:22)when saldhana — who has been on dialysis for five years — heard about it, she told her husband to give their cylinder to the man.  ""don't worry about me.  i'm fit enough,"" her husband recollected her saying. she did not stop there.  she told her husband to sell all her jewellery and buy oxygen to help more people.  he received 80,000 rupees (s$1,450) from the sale and did as his wife had asked. over in delhi, a sikh voluntary organisation called khalsa help international has set up makeshift hospital facilities in several locations to treat patients.  its free oxygen support service has saved thousands of lives since late april. its founder, gurpreet singh rummy, said the group has not refused anyone.  it has served more than 15,000 people, of whom around 8,000 to 10,000 had arrived in a critical state and would have died without oxygen support, he said.

2021-06-16,NParks 'committed' to intensify efforts to educate public on sensitive marine life.,"singapore: the national parks board (nparks) is ""concerned"" by the large number of visitors over the weekend to the intertidal area at changi beach, and the collection of shellfish and other invertebrates, it said in a statement to cna on wednesday (jun 15). a post shared in the singapore wildlife sightings facebook group on sunday showed these beach visitors digging up sea creatures during an intertidal walk. the visitors were also seen collecting these creatures, including crabs, fish and anemone, in a pail. an intertidal zone is the coastal area that is submerged at high tide, but exposed at low tide. ""regarding the collection of shellfish, other than certain rare species, invertebrates are currently not protected under the wildlife act,"" said ryan lee, group director of the national biodiversity centre at the national parks board, in response to cna's queries. imposing restrictions on all invertebrates would also mean taking into account common pests like cockroaches. ""under the parks and trees act, however, flora and fauna, including invertebrates, cannot be collected in our nature reserves and parks, and these include sisters' islands marine park, sungei buloh wetland reserve, labrador nature reserve's rocky shore and chek jawa wetlands,"" added mr lee. ""offences, including the picking of shellfish, carry fines of up to $5,000 in nparks-managed parks, and up to $50,000 in nature reserves. ""the parks and trees act and its regulations only extend to marine and foreshore areas that are managed or maintained by nparks. while the act does not include the intertidal area in changi beach, mr lee said nparks is ""committed to encouraging community stewardship"" of singapore's natural habitats and biodiversity. ""as such, nparks will intensify our outreach efforts to educate the public to care for the sensitive marine life in intertidal areas,"" he said. ""more signage will be put up, and we will step up patrols by our staff and stakeholders including nature groups and other volunteers.  we will raise awareness on the detrimental effects of touching, collecting or trampling on marine wildlife in their natural habitats. ""he also encouraged the public to help conserve our marine habitats by participating in nparks' intertidal watch citizen science programme. should the public wish to visit intertidal zones, mr lee noted that they should follow safe management measures (smms) in line with the latest advisory for phase 3 (heightened alert). ""the unusually large number of visitors was probably because the low day tides coincided with the school break over the weekend,"" he said. ""the public can refer to the nparks website for the latest advisories for gardens, parks and nature reserves in response to the covid-19 situation. ""in response to queries on what the public should observe on intertidal walks, kua kay yaw, chairman of the marine conservation group at nature society (singapore), told cna that ""the best thing to do is go on intertidal walks with a nature guide"". ""intertidal walks are definitely a healthy and enjoyable activity, and a good way for people to appreciate nature.  removal of any wildlife would deprive the next person from seeing them.  take photos as souvenirs instead,"" said mr kua. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-16,Philippines' Duterte will not cooperate with ICC probe: Spokesman.,"manila: philippine president rodrigo duterte will ""never cooperate"" with aninternational criminal court probeinto the country's deadly drug war, his spokesman said on tuesday (jun 15), branding the process ""legally erroneous"". outgoing icc chief prosecutor fatou bensouda on monday asked judges at the world's only permanent war crimes court to authorise an investigation into allegations that philippine police unlawfully killed as many as tens of thousands of civilians between 2016 and 2019. duterte was elected in 2016 on a campaign promise to get rid of the country's drug problem, and he openly ordered police to kill drug suspects if their lives were in danger. ""the president will never cooperate until the end of his term on jun 30, 2022,"" harry roque told reporters, repeating a previous assertion that the icc has no jurisdiction in the philippines because it pulled out of the tribunal. the philippines left the icc in 2019 after the court launched a preliminary examination into the war on drugs.  bensouda said it could still investigate crimes committed while the country was a member. ""the available information indicates that members of the philippine national police, and others acting in concert with them, have unlawfully killed between several thousand and tens of thousands of civilians"" during the period under investigation, said bensouda, in one of her last acts before stepping down this week. but roque rejected her findings and said it was ""an insult to all filipinos"" to suggest the country's justice system was not working. ""we will be compared to countries like darfur, areas where there is no functioning government.  it's not right,"" he said. ""if killings occurred, appropriate force and violence were observed. ""the crackdown is duterte's signature policy initiative and he defends it fiercely, especially from critics such as western leaders and institutions which he says do not care about the philippines. more than 6,000 people have been killed in over 200,000 anti-drug operations conducted since july 2016, according to official data. human rights groups estimate the number of dead could be several times higher. many suspects have been put on ""drug watch lists"" by local officials and then visited by police at their homes a situation which often ends in a deadly shooting that officers claim was self-defence. rights groups welcomed bensouda's request, with amnesty international describing the icc investigation as a ""landmark step"". it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

"" china considers taiwan as a breakaway province and has repeatedly threatened to take control of the island by military force if necessary to prevent taipei from making a move toward formal independence. the chinese defense ministry said in april that the liaoning aircraft carrier had carried out exercises near taiwan and the navy would plan more drills. ""this big mission is a reminder that china has not renounced the use of force against taiwan, and its size and composition broadcasts beijing's willingness to actively confront, with military might if necessary, anyone who opposes it,"" said mr drew thompson, a former official overseeing military-to-military relations for the us defense secretary, who is now a visiting senior research fellow at the national university of singapore's lee kuan yew school of public policy.  taiwan's foreign ministry said in a statement wednesday that peace and stability in the strait are being ""unilaterally, purposely sabotaged"" and urged the chinese government to end its military threat. the ""blind adherence"" that taiwan's democratic progressive party shows for independence ""is the root cause of tensions in cross-strait relations,"" mr ma xiaoguang, spokesman for the beijing office that handles matters related to taiwan, said at a regular press briefing. ""we will never allow the dpp to regard our goodwill as an opportunity to seek independence, and will never allow anyone to separate taiwan from china in any way,"" mr ma added. the government of president tsai ing-wen views taiwan as an already de facto sovereign nation. earlier this month, a bipartisan us congressional delegation visited taiwan prompting criticism from chinese nationalists online.  china's top diplomat, yang jiechi, urged the us to tread carefully on issues relating to taiwan last week in a call with secretary of state antony blinken. so long as the pla air force acts in accordance with international norms and agreements, the chances of an accident are small, mr thompson said.  ""should pla planes operate in a reckless fashion – regardless of how justified beijing feels about applying military pressure towards taiwan or its neighbors – then the risk of an accident increases considerably,"" he said.  join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

""amongst the new cases today, four are asymptomatic, and were detected from our proactive screening and surveillance, while 10 were symptomatic,"" said the moh. the four unlinked cases in the community are:a 41-year-old filipino woman who is a foreign domestic worker (received first dose of vaccine)a 36-year-old singaporean woman who is a homemakera 30-year-old singaporean woman who works as a sales representative at imperva singaporea 35-year-old singaporean man who is currently unemployedseparately, one case has been linked to the 36-year-old woman, who is his family member and household contact.  he is a 35-year-old singaporean man who works as a senior executive at nets. the ministry noted that the number of new cases in the community has decreased from 93 in the week before to 60 in the past week.  the number of unlinked cases in the community has increased from 10 in the week before to 18 in the past week. the moh also announced the closure of two clusters – ""case 63290"" and white sands – as there have been no cases linked to them for the past two incubation periods, or 28 days.  singapore currently has 44 active covid-19 clusters. the cluster was first linked to a 74-year-old singaporean man who works at a sundry store at the food centre.  the fully-vaccinated man was confirmed to have covid-19 on 9 june. three of the nine new cases linked to the cluster work at the food centre and had been quarantined earlier:a 37-year-old female india national who is a food stall vendora 77-year-old singaporean man who is a food stall vendor (fully vaccinated)a 39-year-old male india national who is a food stall vendor (fully vaccinated)of the remaining six, most are family members or household contacts, or both, of cases in the cluster:a 30-year-old male india national who works as a supervisor at keong hong construction (quarantined earlier)a 33-year-old female permanent resident who is a cleaner employed by sats facility management (quarantined earlier)a 35-year-old singaporean woman who is a teacher at kidscampus at chai cheea 87-year-old singaporean man who is a retiree; frequently visits 115 and 116 bukit merah view (link to cluster cases not mentioned)a 35-year-old male india national who works as a sales executive at halnaz frozen goods (link to cluster cases not mentioned)a 72-year-old singaporean man who is a retiree (fully vaccinated, link to cluster cases not mentioned)the food centre, initially planned for a 13 to 15 june closure, will now be closed to members of the public till 26 june, said the moh on tuesday.  this is due to the detection of more cases amongst the market and food centre staff and their close contacts, which suggests that there is ""ongoing spread with wider transmission"", the ministry noted. all staff and tenants who have been working at 115 bukit merah view market & food centre from 25 may have been placed on quarantine, and are tested during quarantine. the moh said that special testing operations have commenced on monday for all staff and tenants who have been working in 116 bukit merah view from 25 may.  free covid-19 testing has also been extended to members of the public who had visited the shops at 115 and 116 bukit merah view between 25 may and 12 june, it added.  these testing operations are in progress, said the moh.

2021-06-16,"‘Like a murder’: South Korean women face widespread online sex abuse, rights group says.","seoul — south korea is facing a growing epidemic of online and tech-enabled ""digital sex crimes"" that is inflicting grave damage on women and girls, but the government has not done enough to stamp out the menace, human rights watch said in a report released wednesday. south korea, a global leader in information and communication technology, is struggling to cope with a rise in crimes involving intimate images — almost always of women — that are captured and shared digitally without consent or manipulated to impersonate the victim in a sexually degrading manner. ""the root cause of digital sex crimes in south korea is widely accepted harmful views about and conduct toward women and girls that the government urgently needs to address,"" said heather barr, interim co-director for women's rights at human rights watch.  ""the government has tinkered with the law but has not sent a clear and forceful message that women and men are equal, and misogyny is unacceptable. ""the title of the 92-page report, ""my life is not your porn,"" was the slogan used in rallies in south korea in 2018.  tens of thousands of women marched on the streets of seoul to protest voyeuristic pornography produced by illegal filming and criticize the government's inaction to stamp out the criminal practice. according to south korean police data, the five-year average caseload of illegal-filming-related sex crimes reached 6,192 between 2015 and 2019, an 86 percent increase from the previous five years' average of 3,330. since the mass protest in 2018, the south korean government has changed the law and come up with prevention measures against digital sex crimes and a support system for the victims.  however, women and girls who have been targeted still face hurdles in accessing justice, according to testimonies cited in the report. drawing from interviews with 12 survivors of digital sex crimes in addition to officials and experts, the report pointed to lack of awareness, victim shaming and insensitive investigation methods as barriers to seeking justice. the fact that online images are easily copied adds to the uniquely persistent impact of digital sex crime, which leaves a lasting impact on the victims' lives. ""one of the most difficult things during the cybercrime was that i had to delete the numerous posts,"" one of the survivors, using the pseudonym of kang yu-jin, was quoted as saying in the report.  ""it was a very painful and difficult job. ""kang said she was left on her own to rid the internet of sexually degrading images impersonating her, even after her ex-boyfriend was given a suspended sentence for posting them.  she spent several months deleting manipulated images, including ones that merged her face with nude photos of other women. ""it's like a murder, even though he didn't use a knife or a weapon.  it's like a murder to someone's identity or mentality,"" she told the rights group. another interviewee in the report said she had been filmed unknowingly by a miniature camera hidden in a clock.  her employer, who gifted her the clock, admitted that he was looking at her in her bedroom through the camera for a month. even after the perpetrator was sentenced to 10 months' imprisonment, she said she had to take medicine for depression and anxiety because of the traumatizing experience. ""what happened took place in my own room — so sometimes, in regular life, in my own room, i feel terrified without reason,"" she was quoted as saying in the report. the release of the report comes amid fresh scandals involving secret filming in south korea. earlier this month, the center for military human rights korea said an air force sergeant was caught breaking into women's dormitories and illegally filming female soldiers, but he was allowed to continue working with apparent impunity.  the air force authorities said later that the service has been conducting an investigation. late last month, seoul's education superintendent, joe hee-yeon, issued a public apology after a high school teacher was caught installing spy cameras at the women's toilet in a school. experts say a tougher and more detailed set of regulations is necessary to prevent the misuse of technology in digital sex crimes, but more fundamental is the need to address the underlying culture of misogyny at the core of the abuse. the most important news stories of the day, curated by post editors and delivered every morning. by signing up you agree to our terms of use and privacy

2021-06-16,Macau follows Hong Kong in shuttering Taiwan office.,"macau said wednesday it was closing its representative office in taiwan, following neighbouring hong kong which made the same move last month in protest at taipei's support for pro-democracy activists. hong kong and macau are ""semi-autonomous"" chinese cities, although foreign policy is all but decided by beijing and the central government has taken an increasingly more direct say in how both former colonies are run in recent years. in a short statement, macau announced its economic and cultural delegation in taiwan will temporarily suspend operations from june 19. in response, taiwan's mainland affairs council expressed ""deep regret over the macau government's unilateral decision,"" saying it would continue to keep its trade office in the chinese gambling enclave open. macau gave no reason for the closure.  but the wording was almost identical to last month's statement by hong kong. that announcement was then followed by hong kong's government confirming the closure was indeed political. taiwan, hong kong said, had ""grossly interfered"" in the city's affairs on repeated occasions and ""created irretrievable damage"" to relations. hong kong and macau abide by authoritarian china's view that democratic, self-ruled taiwan is part of its territory and must be seized one day, by force if necessary. that makes any official contact with taipei tricky, even though taiwan is a major trading partner. china had encouraged trade offices when relations were warmer. but since the 2016 election of taiwan's president tsai ing-wen, beijing cut official contacts and ramped up economic, military and diplomatic pressure. beijing loathes tsai because she regards taiwan as a de facto sovereign nation and not part of ""one china"". her government is also a vocal supporter of democratic principles and has quietly helped open its doors to some hong kongers trying to escape beijing's crackdown on dissent after huge democracy protests rocked the financial hub in 2019. jta/qanbeijing's new top diplomat in hong kong, who called the battle against ""foreign forces"" his top priority after taking the job last month, has doubled down on that message, saying those seeking to curb china's growth or undermine its dignity are ""doomed to fail"".  in his first public appearance as

2021-06-16,The Guardian view on delaying lockdown easing: sadly unavoidable.,"the exponential spread of the delta variant, and the uncertainties surrounding it, mean pausing the roadmap is justifiedlast modified on tue 15 jun 2021 07. 38 edtsince february, when boris johnson unveiled a four-step roadmap to ending all covid restrictions in england, progress has been steady and at times relatively serene compared with the periods of abject confusion and chaos that went before.  the successful rollout of the vaccination programme allowed targets to be met, including the substantial ""step three"" easing of restrictions on 17 may. but as boris johnson recognised in his press conference today, the spread of the new delta variant – which now accounts for 96% of covid cases in the united kingdom – has upended calculations.  latest data suggests it is 40-80% more transmissible than the alpha variant, which originated in kent.  the variant partly evades vaccines and appears to increase the risk of hospitalisation.  hospital admission rates are increasing by 50% a week and 61% in the north-west.  a significant third wave is thus under way and the government's scientific advisers do not know the extent to which current rates of vaccination and acquired immunity will keep it in check.  a summer surge in hospitalisations could overwhelm an already overstretched nhs. the prime minister is therefore right to opt for caution by delaying the lifting of all covid restrictions until 19 july, reviewing the data in two weeks' time.  the roadmap has encountered a significant new hazard and, as mr johnson put it: ""now is the time to ease off the accelerator. "" given that significant unlocking has already taken place, it must be hoped this pause is enough to put the brakes on the new wave.  it will allow vital progress to be made in administering millions of second vaccine doses, which greatly increase protection against the delta variant.  it will also allow time to focus on reaching the 2 million or so over-50s who have still not been fully vaccinated, and to speed up second doses for the under-40s.  this will save lives.  by late july, schools will be breaking up for the summer, further reducing transmission risk.  even so, it seems likely that there will be another fraught review of data next month, in order to assess whether the link between infection and hospitalisation has been sufficiently broken to fully unlock. the delay is, of course, another bitter blow for the hospitality industry and the arts.  theatres, restaurants, pubs, concert venues and nightclubs, after haemorrhaging cash for more than a year, have spent money that they haven't got preparing for a full reopening next week.  many businesses are teetering on the edge of the abyss and some will now go under.  the level of the government's support should reflect the extent of the restrictions it continues to impose.  instead, the treasury is sticking to its plan to scale down the furlough scheme and business rate relief, ramping the financial pressure up still further.  this is shortsighted and unfair.  far more needs to be done to address the dire predicament of much-loved institutions, many of them independently owned and part of the fabric of their communities.  there was at least some limited good news for those who planned summer nuptials on the presumption that all restrictions would be lifted.  mr johnson announced the current cap on 30 guests will still be lifted for weddings and for funerals, though other restrictions and social distancing will remain in place.  the delta variant has cast a shadow over the summer.  but given the greater risks it has unleashed, and its virulence, mr johnson was right to heed the scientific advice and press the pause button for the time being.  as sir patrick vallance suggested today, the vaccination programme is now in a race with a faster-spreading variant.  the four-week delay is necessary to help it win that crucial contest.

""earlier, china's mission to the european union warned nato that the country would not ""sit back"" in the face of any challenges. the nato statement ""slandered"" china's peaceful development, misjudged the international situation and indicated a ""cold war mentality"", china said in a response posted on the mission's website.  china is always committed to peaceful development, it added. it also said beijing does not pose a ""systemic challenge"" to any country, adding that nato should not exaggerate china's military power. the statement also urged nato to push forward with dialogue and cooperation, and said the bloc should work to safeguard international and regional stability. the comments from beijing come after nato secretary-general jens stoltenberg told reporters that the alliance is ""concerned by china's coercive policies, which stand in contrast to the fundamental values enshrined in the washington treaty"" on which the bloc rests. he cited the country's rapidly expanding nuclear arsenal, military cooperation with russia and its use of disinformation. the communique released after the nato meeting mentioned china 10 times, compared with just once after the last summit in 2019. the us is ill and very ill indeed.  the g-7 had better take its pulse and come up with a prescription. russia was named more than 60 times this year. the document also said that the bloc ""maintains a constructive dialogue with china where possible"". washington has been seeking to build a united front on beijing, though mr biden settled for a modest condemnation at the g-7 meeting over the weekend. mr biden had pushed for the group to confront china on topics such as alleged forced labour and human rights abuses, and on its belt and road initiative plan. he said he also raised the issue of china refusing outside access to its laboratories to determine the origin of the covid-19 outbreak. the g-7 communique calls for a ""timely, transparent, expert-led and science-based"" study led by the world health organisation into the disease's origins. several leaders, including german chancellor angela merkel, pushed back amid concern about turning the g-7 into an anti-china group, suggesting that any infrastructure programme the nations supported should be framed as a more positive, pro-environment effort. bloomberg, reutersjoin st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-16,Football: Doubts over Ronaldo dispelled as veteran comes up with the goods.,"budapest, hungary: some people doubted whether, after a long and arduous season, 36-year-old cristiano ronaldo could still produce the goods for his country, but afterportugal's 3-0 win over hungaryin their euro 2020 opener on tuesday, the doubters have their answer. portugal, the champions in 2016, came into the rearranged tournament as one of the favourites given the attacking talent at coach fernando santos' disposal. bruno fernandes has enjoyed a prolific season at manchester united and is already one of the club's most crucial players; diogo jota has hit the ground running at liverpool; and bernardo silva played a crucial part in manchester city's premier league title win. but as the premier league trio flattered to deceive in front of a packed, boisterous crowd in budapest, and hungary's defence stood firm, portugal again needed their relentless talisman to pull them through. he left it late, but he did not disappoint. it was also a case of another day, another record for ronaldo.  the penalty he converted to put portugal 2-0 up in the 87th minute ensured he became the first player in european championship finals history to reach 10 goals overall, and then 11 with an injury-time strike, overtaking michel platini's record of nine all scored in the 1984 tournament. it had looked as though it was going to be a frustrating evening for the juventus forward.  he missed a glorious chance in the first half to open the scoring, with his team mates also lacking composure in front of goal. jota has now scored one goal in his last 11 matches for club and country, and was replaced in the second half, with the effects of his injury-hit season clear for all to see. but after portugal's fortunate opener six minutes from time, it was all about ronaldo, who added a coolly taken third 177 seconds after firing home from the penalty spot. the way in which he remained calm before rounding the goalkeeper for his second of the night proved that even when not at his best, his potency in front of goal, when it matters, remains as lethal as ever. that is now 106 international goals for the veteran, three off the all-time record set by iran's ali daei. the desire for more goals and records remains stronger than ever.  after this imposing start to the tournament, few would bet against ronaldo surpassing daei and adding one more accolade to his ever-growing list before euro 2020 is out. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-16,Football: Record-breaking Ronaldo strikes late as Portugal sink Hungary.,"budapest: cristiano ronaldo struck a late double to help holders portugal get off to a winning start with a 3-0 victory over hungary in front of a 67,000 crowd on tuesday (jun 15) as the forward became the all-time leading scorer at european championship finals. hungary rode a wave of early pressure from portugal in the group f clash and had a goal ruled out for offside shortly before portugal's raphael guerreiro broke the deadlock at the other end with a deflected effort in the 84th minute. captain ronaldo sealed the win by lashing home from the penalty spot in the 87th to move ahead of michel platini as the all-time top scorer at the finals on 10 goals, which he quickly turned into 11 by dribbling the ball into the net in added time. ""it was a very difficult game but we got three goals.  it was vital to win and start the tournament with confidence and now we want to keep on winning,"" said ronaldo. portugal coach fernando santos added: ""if we'd scored earlier it would have been easier for us.  we missed a few chances then had some anxious moments but found our composure again and finished the game well. ""the two sides had drawn 3-3 in one of the best games of euro 2016 and although there were fewer goals this time around the match was no less compelling as the vociferous locals filled the puskas arena to capacity. the action on the pitch mirrored the fervour in the stands as portugal played with real intensity, playing a direct game and hitting their front three with quick, long passes. diogo jota had the first clear sight of goal when he thumped a shot which was parried by keeper peter gulacsi, incurring the wrath of a furious ronaldo who was in a better place to shoot. ronaldo missronaldo was left only blaming himself late in the first half though when he uncharacteristically missed the target from close range after an incisive cross from bruno fernandes. striker adam szalai was hungary's main threat, heading a free kick into the arms of rui patricio shortly before halftime then testing the keeper again early in the second half. portugal's veteran defender pepe nearly scored at the start of the second half but was thwarted by the ever-alert gulacsi, who later turned away a strike from fernandes. hungary substitute szabolcs schon set the stadium alight in the 80th minute when his shot squirmed past patricio but the linesman's flag was quickly raised to puncture the celebrations. guerreiro soon brought the hosts more pain as his scuffed shot trickled into the far corner of the net off the foot of hungary defender willi orban, who moments later fouled rafa silva to allow ronaldo to score from the spot. ronaldo then combined with silva to calmly dance past gulacsi and round off a day of records after also becoming the only player to feature in five european championships and to play the most games at the finals. the noisy locals and a sizeable travelling portugal support made for a raucous atmosphere barely seen at any football game since the novel coronavirus pandemic struck in march 2020 and forced matches behind closed doors. hungary recorded the most deaths per capita in the world, according to johns hopkins university data, but football-mad prime minister viktor orban was intent on filling the shiny new stadium, which opened in 2019, as he seeks to boost his popularity ahead of next year's election. orban, who was at the game, has channelled billions of euros in state funds to upgrade an ageing football infrastructure and incurred widespread criticism for prioritising football over healthcare funds, particularly as the pandemic raged. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

two singapore universities have set up a sg$23 million ($17. 39 million) research fund to develop sustainable cooling technologies for data centres operating in tropical locations.  the initiative will include a testbed facility that is slated to be up and running this october.  jointly led by national university of singapore (nus) and nanyang technological university (ntu), the programme is funded by singapore's national research foundation (nrf) as well as facebook.  five other industry players also are participating in the initiative including keppel data centres, ascenix, and red dot analytics.  key government agencies in singapore also would provide feedback on the research conducted.  the testbed would provide a platform for researchers and industry players to collaborate, the universities said in a statement wednesday.  energy-efficient cooling technologies would be developed and demonstrated at the facility, they added.  

                        singapore puts budget focus on transformation, innovation
                    
after tilting last year's budget towards 'emergency support' in light of the global pandemic, singapore's government will spend sg$24 billion ($18. 1 billion) over the next three years to help local businesses innovate and build capabilities needed to take them through the next phase of transformation.

they noted the need to do so as increasing digitalisation continued to drive demand for data centres, which currently were air-cooled at temperatures between 23 degrees and 27 degrees.  these facilities also required ambient humidity to be maintained between 50% and 60%. doing so in tropical climates such as singapore's consumed more power, which drove up costs and carbon emissions.  with singapore home to 60% of data centres in southeast asia, almost 7% of the country's total energy requirements went towards powering these facilities.  this number was expected to hit 12% by 2030.  pointing to these stats, the universities underscored the need to cut power consumption and carbon footprint by ""packing more computing power within the same floor area"".  better solutions to sustain the cooling demands of data centres also needed to be developed.  to be located at nus' kent ridge campus, the ""full-scale"" testbed datacentre facility would be equipped with equipment such as a desiccant-coated heat exchanger design and statepoint liquid cooling system (splc).  developed by nortek air solutions alongside facebook, the splc was touted to enable data centres to operate more efficiently in tropical locations. chip-based hybrid cooling technologies also would be adopted to cool servers, while artificial intelligence (ai) would be tapped to manage operations.  collectively, these aimed to enhance the efficiencies of water and power consumption in data centre equipment in the long run.  the testbed also would allow potential operational risks of conceptual technologies to be identified, the universities said, adding that four technologies currently were under research at the sustainable tropical data centre testbed.  these included raising air-cooling temperatures and relative humidity levels while maintaining the performance and resilience of datacentre equipment.  another research project would assess a heat sink design that integrated both air and liquid cooling technologies in a single chip, eliminating the need for connectors and ducts.  this aimed to evaluate alternative air-cooling solutions during water-loop maintenance, so server downtime could be reduced.  the testbed also would look at cooling technologies that were digitalised to allow real-time monitoring and ai-based optimisation.  when deployed successfully, these capabilities could potentially cut energy consumption and slash greenhouse gas emissions by up to 25%, compared to datacentre deployments that were traditionally air-cooled.  if adopted across all tropical markets, they could slash energy consumption within the data centre industry by at least 40%.  the testbed also would look to provide operating guidelines and establish new standards, based on its research findings, for sustainable datacentre operations.  nrf ceo low teck seng said: ""data centres are the backbone of the digital economy and they require constant cooling for optimal operations.  the new [testbed] will accelerate the development and testbedding of innovative and sustainable solutions for data centres, towards commercial deployment.

2021-06-16,"Myopia rising among kids in S'pore as screen time goes up during the pandemic, Life News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore samantha (not her real name) did not have to change her glasses for two years.  but with increased screen time during the pandemic, her myopia shot up from 300 to 400 degrees for both eyes in december last year. the 11-year-old was spending as many as 10 hours a day looking at screens, be it for online lessons or digital entertainment. her parents were so busy working at home that they left her to her own devices, ophthalmologist claudine pang, founder and medical director of asia retina eye surgery centre, tells the straits times. a year since the end of the circuit breaker, eye-care professionals here are seeing more kids who are starting to have myopia, or whose condition has worsened. mr ken tong, eyesight. sg vision-care clinic's founder and chief executive officer, has observed a 30 to 40 per cent increase in children visiting his outlets in potong pasir and tampines after the circuit breaker. besides seeing more first-time spectacle wearers aged five and six, he notes that some of the myopic children needed to change their lenses in six months instead of the usual one year. optometrist jaycob chin, branch manager at videre eyecare at forum the shopping mall, has also noticed a rise in myopia among children since covid-19. one contributing factor is greater screen time.  ""the number of hours spent on digital devices has increased dramatically with the implementation of home-based learning,"" he says.  ""most children will soon receive their personal learning devices and we could see a spike in myopic cases in the near future. ""it is a trend found elsewhere too. a study of 123,535 children in china found that the prevalence of myopia in kids aged six to eight increased last year over the previous five years, following school closures due to the pandemic.  the study was published in jama ophthalmology journal in january. also known as shortsightedness or near-sightedness, myopia is a vision disorder where distant objects appear blurry. in singapore, 80 per cent of 18-year-olds are myopic, says associate professor audrey chia, head of the paediatric ophthalmology and adult strabismus department at singapore national eye centre (snec). myopia can affect pre-schoolers, with 7 per cent of five-year-olds in singapore having to wear glasses.  this figure increases to 10 to 20 per cent in primary 1 and 2 pupils; 30 to 40 per cent in primary 3 and 4 pupils; and 60 per cent in primary 6 pupils. most young children do not have a concept of what blurred vision is, or that it is possible for their eyesight to be better, says mr chin. as such, their myopia may be diagnosed and treated only at a later age.  this puts them at greater risk of developing higher degrees of myopia when they are older. parents should look out for signs of myopia in their kids.  these include holding a book very close to the eyes, moving closer to see an object, tilting the head or squinting the eyes. while parents should take their kids for regular eye checks, preferably once every six months, some are postponing such appointments during the pandemic, notes senior optometrist chew wai kwong from videre eyecare at centrepoint.  the store has seen more myopic kids since the circuit breaker as well. parents whose children are under eight years can consider taking them to a paediatric eye clinic for assessment and their spectacle prescription, says prof chia, who is also the co-clinical director of snec's myopia centre.  cycloplegic eye drops are often used in young children to obtain accurate prescriptions for their lenses. ms kathy park, president of essilor ophthalmics company for asean and south korea, says: ""the younger a child becomes myopic, the faster it will progress, and the higher the prescription may eventually become. "" myopia often stabilises only at 18 or later, she adds. dr pang says it is important to slow down the progression of myopia as those with spectacle power above 500 degrees face a higher risk of developing sight-threatening complications later in life like cataract, glaucoma, retinal detachment. while kids spending more time indoors during the pandemic has likely contributed to their worsening eye sight, prof chia says this is a problem even before covid-19. ""even before and after the circuit breaker, children in singapore are not really going out to play.  this led to so many of them getting myopia in the first place. ""dr pang says that, ultimately, children should take the responsibility of caring for their eyes. in the case of her young patient samantha, she went through and reinforced good eye-care habits with her.  for instance, the computer or digital device screen should be placed at least one arm's length away from the eyes.  or take frequent visual breaks with the use of an alarm. ""myopia control and education for the child is just as important as for the parents,"" says dr pang. while one may think myopia is no big deal as one can turn to lasik or other refractive procedures, ms kathy park, president of essilor ophthalmics company for asean and south korea, says this is a misconception. ""refractive surgery can correct myopia only by changing the front parts of the eyes, hence your eyes are still longer than normal.  your risks of myopia complications are the same as somebody with your degrees who has not gone through the surgery. ""even though myopia cannot be reversed, there are many treatment options to prevent it from worsening.  here are some common ones. these are said to help ease eye fatigue caused by the blue light emitted by electronic devices. if your children are getting low to moderate exposure to digital devices, ophthalmologist claudine pang, founder and medical director of asia retina eye surgery centre, recommends using blue light filtering modes or screen protectors on the device directly instead of in spectacle lenses. kids need an adequate amount of blue light from sunlight for growth and to regulate their mood and body clock. ""early studies have shown a deficiency in blue light exposure from the sun could contribute to the increase in myopia,"" she says. as the long-term effects of using blue light-blocking lenses on children's development are not well-known, she does not encourage using them. ophthalmic lens companies, including essilor, have launched lenses that are said to not just correct, but also to help control myopia progression. based on a clinical trial which started in 2018, ms park says essilor's stellest lenses help slow myopia progression by 67 per cent on average when worn at least 12 hours a day.  the trial is still ongoing. professor audrey chia, head of the paediatric ophthalmology and adult strabismus department at singapore national eye centre, says early reports about myopia control lenses are promising and they may work better in kids aged nine and above. younger children and those with high myopia or astigmatic degrees were not part of the study, which looked at kids aged eight to 13. prof chia says parents can consider these lenses if their kids have progressive myopia, which means an increase of more than 50 to 100 degrees in their spectacle power a year. an established treatment option for myopia, atropine can be used alone or in combination with optical devices such as glasses or contact lenses, says prof chia. dr pang says the eye drops, which have been in the market for about 20 years, is suitable for children with progressive myopia.  they come in different dosages and concentrations and need to be prescribed by an eye doctor. ""normally, we monitor a child's myopia degree closely and start the eye drops when we notice a rapid increase in myopia,"" says dr pang. ""parents who are more proactive may choose to start the eye drops at the first sign of myopia so that they may commence myopia control as early as they can. ""it is found to be effective in reducing myopia progression by 50 to 70 per cent.  some users may complain of glare from bright light, but this can be overcome by using transition lenses. as with all treatments, every child responds differently. ""it is important that parents know this to avoid disappointment, and also to know that good eye habits are important, even on treatment,"" says prof chia. ""for every 20 minutes spent using a screen, children should look away at an object that is at least 20 feet (6m) away for at least 20 seconds,"" says ms kathy park, president of essilor ophthalmics company for asean and south korea. videre eyecare's optometrist jaycob chin says kids should not be using smartphones when they are taking a break from their study on a laptop.  this does not give their eyes the rest that they need. children should play outdoors for at least two hours a day, says ms park. when they play outdoors, they are exposed to natural sunlight and can focus their eyes at further distances, which helps to relax the eye muscles. ophthalmologist claudine pang, founder and medical director of asia retina eye surgery centre, says it is important for kids to have sufficient sleep to prevent eye strain.  get them to turn in early before the urge to rub their eyes sets in. schedule eye checks every six months to monitor if your child's eyesight has deteriorated.  try to stick to the appointments so that your child's myopia can be managed better. experts suggest setting limits to screen time outside of online lessons. as a guide, the american academy of pediatrics advocates no screen time for kids under two years old; an hour a day for those aged between two and five; and consistent limits on screen time for those over six. the spectacle frames are just as important as the lenses. when the lenses are not fitted on the face correctly, their focus areas do not correspond to the child's line of sight.  as such, the spectacles do not treat the myopia adequately and may exacerbate its progression, says dr pang. keeping in mind a child's active lifestyle, ms park says the ideal frame should be light, flexible and preferably with adjustable nose pads. its material should also be resistant to sweat and corrosion.  get the st smart parenting newsletter for expert advice.  visit the microsite for more. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

higher degrees of myopia when they are older.', 'parents should look out for signs of myopia in their kids.', 'these include holding a book very close to the eyes, moving closer to see an object,

2021-06-16,Centuries-old shipwrecks found off Singapore.,"two centuries-old shipwrecks packed with ceramics and other artefacts have been found off singapore in a rare discovery that will shed light on the city-state's maritime heritage, archaeologists said wednesday. the prosperous island nation has long been a key trading hub on global shipping routes connecting the indian ocean and the south china sea. the wrecks were found off pedra branca, a rocky outcrop east of singapore, according to the national heritage board and think tank the iseas-yusof ishak institute, which worked together on the project. the first wreck, discovered after divers accidentally came across ceramic plates in 2015, was carrying chinese ceramics that possibly date back to the 14th century, when singapore was known as temasek. some of the items were similar to artefacts found in archaeological digs on land, which showed that singapore was a trading hub well before the arrival of british colonisers in 1819. undersea excavations on the first wreck led to the discovery of the second, which is likely to be the shah munchah, a merchant vessel built in india that sank in 1796 while sailing from china to india. items recovered from the second wreck ranged from chinese ceramics to glass and agate objects, as well anchors and cannons, the heritage board and think tank said. the survey and recovery of artefacts from the two wrecks was completed this year. such cannons were typically mounted on merchant ships used by the east india company --- the trading behemoth through which the british empire expanded in asia -- in the 18th and 19th centuries, they added. the vessel discovered in 2015 was the first ancient shipwreck to be found in singapore's waters. it was carrying ""more yuan dynasty blue-and-white porcelain than any other documented shipwreck in the world,"" said michael flecker, a visiting fellow at the iseas-yusof ishak institute's archaeology unit. ""many of the pieces are rare, and one is believed to be unique. ""the yuan dynasty existed in what is now china in the 13th and 14th centuries. much of the chinese cargo in the second wreck was destined for eventual shipping to britain, said flecker. mba/sr/qanbeijing's new top diplomat in hong kong, who called the battle against ""foreign forces"" his top priority after taking the job last month, has doubled down on that message, saying those seeking to curb china's growth or undermine its dignity are ""doomed to fail"".  in his first public appearance as commissioner of the chinese ministry of foreign affairs in hong kong, liu guangyuan on wednesday said last week's passing of an anti-sanctions law by china's top legislative body reflected a ""pressing nealibaba group was the victim of a months-long web-scraping operation by a marketing consultant that siphoned up sensitive data including usernames and phone numbers. meet the paypal business debit card.  use it everywhere mastercard® is accepted. it's useful to be ready with the names of a few companies you'll scoop up in case a crash occurs.  the post 3 stocks i will buy if the market crashes tomorrow appeared first on the smart investor. a herd of elephants on a mammoth trek across china is taking an enforced break -- as they wait for a wayward youngster to catch-up. getting the covid-19 vaccine in singapore is easy.  according to the ministry of health (moh), as of 17 may 2021, 3. 4 million doses have been administered.  here's a guide on how to find a vaccination centre near you. learn more about scalp psoriasis.  look for scalp psoriasis treatments. with afghan troops in retreat and soon to lose vital american air support, taliban commanders are voicing exuberance about quickly seizing full control of the country and re-establishing their version of an islamic state. japan has requested consolations with china at the world trade organization (wto) over anti-dumping duties that have been placed on its stainless steel products since july 2019, the geneva-based body confirmed on tuesday.  the request, which was circulated to wto members on tuesday after having been submitted on friday, claims the measures imposed on steel billets, hot-rolled coils and hot-rolled plates appear to be inconsistent with various provisions under the general agreement on tariffs and t* peso hits lowest since may 28  * singapore stocks track best day since may 18  * graphic: world fx rates https://tmsnrt. rs/2rbwi5e  * asian stock markets: https://tmsnrt. rs/2zpuar4  by shashwat awasthi  june 15 (reuters) the philippine peso fell the most in more than two months on tuesday after coronavirus curbs were prolonged in the capital manila and nearby provinces until end-june and quarantine measures were tightened to battle rising infections.   the philippines has the second highest number of infections and casualties in southeast asia after indonesia and finds its healthcare sector stretched as it battles rising cases.   president rodrigo duterte announced the extension of curbs on monday. celebrated surgeon and author of the new york times best seller ""the plant paradox"" reveals what many have suspected for a long time, and even worse. the russian skipper of a container ship that caught fire and burned for almost two weeks before sinking off sri lanka's coast has been arrested and is expected to be charged with marine pollution, police said monday. cristiano ronaldo netted a double to become the european championship's all-time leading scorer as portugal struck three times late on to beat a stubborn hungary 3-0 in their euro 2020 opener at a packed puskas arena on tuesday. turkish president recep tayyip erdogan on tuesday pledged support for azerbaijan if the ex-soviet country was attacked, as he made a visit to the disputed nagorno-karabakh region. this new car cloth can easily remove all the car scratches and dents from your car. two experienced astronauts are among the first three-man crew for china's first space station, with final preparations under way for their mission launch on thursday.  the long march 2f rocket carrying them to the tianhe module – the first part of the tiangong space station – is expected to lift off at around 9. 22am from the jiuquan satellite launch centre in the gobi desert.  propellant refuelling for the rocket was under way on wednesday morning, according to the china manned space engineering othe largest bank in singapore, dbs was named the 'world's best bank' in 2019.  if you're a loyal dbs/posb customer and have no plans to switch banks, here are the credit cards worth your salt.  as the economy grapples with the plunge in consumer spending, [. . . ] the post loyal dbs/posb customers: which credit card should you add to your wallet?

upon the institute's confirmation that the plates were high-quality celadon ceramics dated to the 14th century, the national heritage board (nhb) partnered the institute to conduct a survey at the pedra branca site, discovering a shipwreck in 2016. following the end of excavation works for the first shipwreck, nhb and iseas conducted a survey around pedra branca and uncovered a second shipwreck dating to the late 18th century.  efforts were then made to excavate this shipwreck between 2019 and 2021. the first wreck was located about 100m north-west of the island, the nhb and iseas announced on wednesday (june 16).  the second wreck was found 300m east of pedra branca. in an interview with the straits times about the historic finds, dr flecker said various chinese ceramics formed a large majority of the haul from the first wreck, with some matching those previously excavated in mainland singapore. for instance, longquan greenware dishes from the first wreck match those that had been unearthed earlier at fort canning, with both bearing a double fish motif. ""from fort canning, there is a plate that is so similar you might almost be tempted to think they used the same stamp (to produce the motif),"" said dr flecker, a visiting fellow at iseas. while research is ongoing, dr flecker said the find would be especially significant if it could be proven that the vessel was going to call at singapore something he believes to be true. ceramics from the wreck are also similar to those excavated at empress place in 2015, and more research will be done to improve existing knowledge on maritime trading history in the region during the 14th century. dr flecker, who has about 30 years of maritime archaeology experience, added that the yuan blue-and-white ceramic haul from the first wreck is also the largest that has been recovered from a shipwreck to date. ""there's only been three other (wreck) sites with yuan blue-and-white porcelain anywhere in the world, and in much smaller quantities,"" he said, adding that it was clear from the primary cargo of both vessels chinese ceramics that they were loaded in china. the shah munchah wreck site yielded a much wider range of artefacts, from instruments to cannon. among the surprising finds were percussion instruments, including a tambourine and a coconut shaker with a handle, said dr flecker. wooden frame parasols, metal betel nut cutters and a myriad of figurines were also retrieved by divers.

the heaviest finds were four anchors as long as 5m and weighing 2. 5 tonnes each and nine cannon, which required a craned vessel to remove them from the seabed. dr flecker said the anchors were designed in the admiralty style, adding: ""they are suitable for very large sailing vessels so it's a good find and it's well worth getting them up for conservation. ""the nine cannon, which dr flecker described as a ""representative set"" of what was used then, were typically mounted on ships employed by the east india company in the 18th and early 19th centuries, and used for defence as well as signalling.

artefacts are currently being stored at facilities managed by both nhb and iseas, where they will be cleaned, conserved and catalogued. about the shah munchah, dr flecker said: ""had she survived another 23 years, she would almost certainly have called at the re-established port of singapore. ""her incredibly diverse cargo provides great insights into the type of goods that would have been exchanged and purchased by the new inhabitants of this fledgling city. ""

the two historical shipwrecks are the first to be found within singapore's waters, and will contribute to a better understanding of the nation's maritime past.  as there were no claims to the wrecks and their artefacts at the end of the stipulated notice period of a month, they have been claimed by singapore. although it is very likely there are more wrecks on the seabed in singapore's waters, some of these have been covered by reclamation, while heavy maritime traffic in the singapore strait makes locating others a hazard. nhb's director of heritage research and assessment yeo kirk siang said: ""as an island that has been serving as the gateway to asia for centuries, singapore today is the legacy of our rich maritime heritage.

""we will continue to research the significance of the artefacts and find ways to promote the knowledge, so as to enable more people to learn about them and singapore's maritime history. ""nhb plans to display the artefacts in museums here from the end of this year, while iseas will likely publish findings progressively in reports and research papers. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

the first shipwreck.', 'photo: national heritage board\n\nsome plates retrieved near pedra branca looked very similar to artefacts retrieved from an archaeological dig at empress place.', ""photo: national heritage board\nupon the institute's confirmation that the plates were high-quality celadon ceramics dated to the 14th century, the national heritage board (nhb) partnered the institute to conduct a survey at the pedra branca site, discovering a shipwreck in 2016. following the end of excavation works for the first shipwreck, nhb and iseas conducted a survey around pedra branca and uncovered a second shipwreck dating to the late 18th century."", 'efforts were then made to excavate this shipwreck between 2019 and 2021. the first wreck was located about 100m north-west of the island, the nhb and iseas announced on wednesday (june 16).', 'the second wreck was found 300m east of pedra branca.', 'in an interview with the straits times about the historic finds, dr flecker said various chinese ceramics formed a large majority of the haul from the first wreck, with some matching those previously excavated in mainland singapore.', 'for instance, longquan greenware dishes from the first wreck match those that had been unearthed earlier at fort canning, with both bearing a double fish motif.', '""from fort canning, there is a plate that is so similar you might almost be tempted to think they used the same stamp (to produce the motif),"" said dr flecker, a visiting fellow at iseas.', 'while research is ongoing, dr flecker said the find would be especially significant if it could be proven that the vessel was going to call at singapore something he believes to be true.', 'ceramics from the wreck are also similar to those excavated at empress place in 2015, and more research will be done to improve existing knowledge on maritime trading history in the region during the 14th century.', 'dr flecker, who has about 30 years of maritime archaeology experience, added that the yuan blue-and-white ceramic haul from the first wreck is also the largest that has been recovered from a shipwreck to date.', '""there\'s only been three other (wreck) sites with yuan blue-and-white porcelain anywhere in the world, and in much smaller quantities,"" he said, adding that it was clear from the primary cargo of both vessels chinese ceramics that they were loaded in china.', 'the shah munchah wreck site yielded a much wider range of artefacts, from instruments to cannon.', 'among the surprising finds were percussion instruments, including a tambourine and a coconut shaker with a handle, said dr flecker.', 'wooden frame parasols, metal betel nut cutters and a myriad of figurines were also retrieved by divers.', 'the shah munchah wreck site yielded a wider range of artefacts, including glass bottle stopper, metal betal nut cutters, medallions and figurines.', 'photos: national heritage board\nthe heaviest finds were four anchors as long as 5m and weighing 2.', '5 tonnes each and nine cannon, which required a craned vessel to remove them from the seabed.', 'dr flecker said the anchors were designed in the admiralty style, adding: ""they are suitable for very large sailing vessels so it\'s a good find and it\'s well worth getting them up for conservation.', '""the nine cannon, which dr flecker described as a ""representative set"" of what was used then, were typically mounted on ships employed by the east india company in the 18th and early 19th centuries, and used for defence as well as signalling.', 'a cannon from the site of the shah munchah shipwreck is lifted on board.', 'photo: iseas yusof ishak institute\nartefacts are currently being stored at facilities managed by both nhb and iseas, where they will be cleaned, conserved and catalogued.', 'about the shah munchah, dr flecker said: ""had she survived another 23 years, she would almost certainly have called at the re-established port of singapore.', '""her

2021-06-16,"Online sex crimes crisis in South Korea affecting all women, report finds.","human rights watch found sex crime prosecutions involving illegal filming rose 11-fold between 2008 and 2017last modified on wed 16 jun 2021 01. 39 edtsouth korea's epidemic of online sexual abuse has left survivors traumatised for life, and is adversely affecting all women and girls in the country, according to a new report. molka – the use of hidden cameras to film or share explicit images of women without their consent – is forcing victims to contemplate suicide or to consider quitting their jobs or leaving the country, human rights watch (hrw) said in the report, my life is not your porn: digital sex crimes in south korea. the trauma is worsened by encounters with unsympathetic police and courts, the us-based organisation said, and called on the government to introduce harsher penalties and educate men and boys about the dangers of consuming abusive images online. ""digital sex crimes have become so common, and so feared, in south korea that they are affecting the quality of life of all women and girls,"" heather barr, hrw's interim director of women' rights, said on wednesday. barr, who authored the report, added: ""women and girls told us they avoided using public toilets and felt anxious about hidden cameras in public and even in their homes.  an alarming number of survivors of digital sex crimes said they had considered suicide. ""officials in the legal justice system – most of whom are men – often seem to simply not understand, or not accept, that these are very serious crimes. ""the report, based on 38 interviews and an online survey involving hundreds of women, said sex crime prosecutions involving illegal filming rose 11-fold between 2008 and 2017, according to data from the korean institute of criminology. in 2008, fewer than 4% of prosecutions involved molka, but that had risen to 20% – almost 7,000 cases – by 2017. ""digital sex crimes are an urgent crisis for south korean women and girl,"" said lina yoon, a senior researcher in hrw's asia division. the crime is having a ""devastating impact"" on women, yoon added.  ""police take the issue lightly because there is no physical contact involved.  they don't realise how terrifying it can be. "" the sharing of covert photos and video online means the crime ""never ends for the survivors,"" she said.  ""it stays with them throughout their lives. ""oh soo-jin* was a 20-year-old student when she agreed to pose nude for a part-time modelling job. despite reassurances in her contract that the photographs would remain private, more than 700 images of her appeared on a website after she quit because her boss had demanded more sexually explicit images. more photographs of oh appeared – even after she sought help from the police – leading her to contemplate suicide. ""i'm quite afraid for my future,"" she said.  ""[the images] are going to always be on someone's computer, and i don't know when this will stop.  i thought that if this can't stop, then i want to stop my life. ""barr said most women who reported digital sex crimes had ""terrible experiences"" with the police, with some saying they had been mocked or told they would never find a marriage partner. while upskirting and other non-consensual sexual imagery is now a global problem, it has taken hold quickly in south korea, where perpetrators take advantage of the near-ubiquitous use of mobile devices and the world's fastest internet speeds. the president, moon jae-in, called for police to investigate the growing number of digital sex crimes after mass demonstrations in seoul gained global attention in 2018. in 2020, however, perpetrators receive a fine or a suspended sentence, or both, in 79% of cases.  ""it is not at all proportionate to the harm that has been done,"" barr said. a year earlier, prosecutors dropped 43. 5% of digital sex crime cases compared to 27. 7% of homicide cases and 19% of robbery cases, although the sex crime cases that were prosecuted usually ended in a conviction, the report said. hrw said the government needed to introduce tougher penalties for offenders, increase the number of female police officers, prosecutors, and judges, and address south korea's poor record on gender inequality. * name has been changed international helplines can be found at www. befrienders. org.  in the uk and ireland, samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans. org or jo@samaritans. ie.  in the us, the national suicide prevention lifeline is at 800-273-8255 and online chat is also available.  you can also text home to 741741 to connect with a crisis text line counselor.  in australia, the crisis support service lifeline is 13 11 14.

2021-06-16,Malaysian court overturn Nora Quoirin 'misadventure' jungle death inquest decision as open verdict declared.,"news corp is a network of leading companies in the worlds of diversified media, news, education, and information services. a malaysian court has overturned a ruling by the coroner in the inquest into the death of irish teenager noirin quoirin and declared an open verdict. the body the 15-year-old, who had learning difficulties, was discovered after a huge hunt through the rainforest following her disappearance from a resort outside kuala lumpur in 2019. in january, a coroner handed down a ruling of misadventure, indicating her death during the family holiday was accidental rather than a crime, and said no one else was involved. but her london-based parents, who have dismissed authorities' claims their daughter wandered into the jungle alone at night, and believe she was abducted, said they were ""utterly disappointed"" by the verdict. they lodged a challenge and sought to have the ruling revised to an open verdict -- suggesting there are still questions to be answered about the case. judge azizul azmi adnan this morning handed down his ruling at 9am irish time at the high court in seremban, outside kuala lumpur, via video-link because of coronavirus curbs. he said it is unlikely that nora left their residence at the dusun resort by herself, navigated the challenging terrain and evaded detection for six days during an extensive search and rescue operation. presenting the family's case at a hearing last week, lawyer louise azmi said an open verdict would be ""appropriate"". she said: ""the last thing that (nora) would do is to walk away from the security of her parents. ""malaysian police have stuck to their version of events -- that the teenager clambered out of a window of the family's holiday chalet and wandered off, and insist there was no sign of foul play. but her mother, meabh, has said she believes someone could have placed her body in the spot where it was found, not far from the resort. the teenager disappeared a day after her family checked in to the dusun resort, triggering a 10-day hunt involving hundreds of rescuers, helicopters and sniffer dogs. an autopsy concluded she likely died of starvation and internal bleeding. the coroner said the teenager had been left disoriented by the long journey from britain to malaysia, likely leading her to wander off, and that there was no sign she was murdered or sexually assaulted. the teen had a condition known as holoprosencephaly, where the brain fails to develop normally.  she had limited verbal communication and could only write a few words.  cyclist, 22, left for dead after being hit by car has 'life changing' injuries co down diplomat's shock as same-sex wed ceremony seen by 20 million people keane mocked by pundits over 'captain's armband' jumper worn for france win woman whose late ­husband built home with mica bricks says he'd be devastated©news group newspapers limited in england no.  679215 registered office: 1 london bridge street, london, se1 9gf.

2021-06-16,Opinion.,"advertisementsupported bybret stephensby bret stephensopinion columnistisrael's new government must be a puzzle for anyone who thinks of the jewish state as a racist, fascistic, apartheid enterprise. issawi frej is arab and muslim and used to work for the peace now movement.  now he's israel's minister for regional cooperation.  pnina tamano-shata is black: the mossad rescued her, along with thousands of other ethiopian jews, from hunger and persecution when she was a small child.  she's the minister for immigration and absorption.  nitzan horowitz is the first openly gay man to lead an israeli political party.  he's the health minister.  at least one deputy minister, as yet unnamed, is expected to be a member of the raam party, which is an outgrowth of the major islamist political group in israel. as for benjamin netanyahu, ""king bibi"" has finally left office — churlishly, bitterly, pompously — but in keeping with the normal democratic process.  he faces criminal indictments in multiple cases.  his immediate predecessor as prime minister, ehud olmert, spent 16 months in prison on corruption charges. it's some fascist state that subjects its leaders to the rule of law and the verdicts of a court.  meanwhile, mahmoud abbas, president of the palestinian authority, ""postponed"" elections in april.  he's in the 17th year of his elected four-year term of office. a new government, even one as fragile and fractious as israel's, is always an opportunity for a course correction.  but the course correction israel most needs is not the one its critics generally suppose. netanyahu lasted in office as long as he did not because israelis wanted a strongman or someone who would crush the palestinians.  he lasted because he was, in many ways, good at the job. over his 12 continuous years in office, the israeli economy roughly doubled in size.  last year's abraham accords brought the overarching arab-israeli conflict to a near conclusion, even if the israeli-palestinian conflict remains unsolved.  despite periodic battles with hamas, there were no all-out wars.  israelis were more secure in their persons during the netanyahu years than they had been in the decade prior.  and israel's covid-19 vaccination campaign was the envy of the world. against iran, israel conducted arguably the most successful covert-ops campaign in modern history.  with respect to palestinians, netanyahu avoided both the territorial concessions demanded by the left and the re-occupation of gaza desired by the extreme right.  toward the united states, netanyahu defied barack obama and got what he wanted from donald trump: the american embassy in jerusalem, recognition of israeli sovereignty in the golan heights, and u. s.  withdrawal from the 2015 iran nuclear deal. none of this may square with the wishes of western elites or progressives, whose obsession is for a palestinian state.  but what israelis wanted in the last election wasn't a palestinian state, which is a good idea in theory but (for now) a terrible idea in practice. what israelis want is a better form of politics, the one area in which netanyahu conspicuously failed.  it's a politics freed of his habits of demagogy, vilification, sleaziness and sheer pettiness — a politics that ultimately brought him down. that's the promise of the new government.  it's led by naftali bennett, a right-winger and former director of the settlers' council who is the first religiously observant orthodox jew to be prime minister.  it's anchored by yair lapid, a centrist and former tv journalist who epitomizes secular israel.  it got into power thanks to the support of the raam party's mansour abbas, a religiously conservative muslim who has implicitly given a stamp of endorsement to a government whose policies — especially toward palestinians — he surely opposes.  it includes members who are to the right of likud and to the left of labor. it's difficult to think of any coalition government, in any country, that is as ideologically diverse.  it's also easy to suppose that nothing holds it together beyond shared loathing of netanyahu, who remains leader of the opposition.  it wouldn't take much to bring the new government down and return him to power. but there is also an opportunity in the new government, and it holds lessons for other western democracies gripped by partisanship and paralysis.  nearly all members of the new coalition had to sacrifice a point of political or moral principle, break ranks with some of their own constituents and get branded as traitors to their respective movements in order to make this coalition possible.  they are ideological turncoats, at least to those who think of ideological purity as a virtue. being willing to abandon a ferocious conviction for the sake of a pragmatic compromise used to be considered a virtue in democracy.  ideological treason can also be a form of civic patriotism.  in what's supposed to be one of the free world's most factionalized, tribalized, internally divided countries — jews, arabs, secular, national-religious, ultra-orthodox, mizrahi, russian, druze and so on — an israeli government is giving civic nationalism a go. it may or may not work.  but like so much else in israel, it deserves more respect than it is likely to get. the times is committed to publishing a

2021-06-16,North Korea defector says 'even North Korea is not this nuts' after attending Ivy League university: 'Complete chaos'.,"a north korean defector is claiming that the united states's future ""is as bleak as north korea"" after she attended an ivy league university. ""even north korea is not this nuts,"" north korean defector yeonmi park said of her experience at columbia university.  ""north korea was pretty crazy, but not this crazy. ""the 27-year-old park said she transferred to columbia from a south korean university in 2016, but her experience at the school left her disturbed. ""i expected that i was paying this fortune, all this time and energy, to learn how to think.  but they are forcing you to think the way they want you to think,"" park said.  ""i realized, wow, this is insane.  i thought america was different, but i saw so many similarities to what i saw in north korea that i started worrying. ""student government recuses presidential search committee member because of his conservative viewsone such similarity park noticed was an anti-western sentiment, but she also noted that other red flags, such as collective guilt and extreme political correctness, were also pervasive at the school. in one instance, park said she was ""scolded"" by a staff member for saying she enjoyed classic literature such as jane austen. ""i said, 'i love those books. ' i thought it was a good thing,"" park said.  ""then, she was like, 'did you know that those writers, who had a colonial mindset, were racists and bigots who wrote those books? so they are subconsciously brainwashing you. '""park noted that such incidents were not isolated, as every class she took at the school contained the kind of anti-american propaganda she had grown up with as a young student in north korea. ""'american bastard' was one word for north koreans,"" park said she was taught growing up.  ""the math problems would say, 'there are four american bastards, you kill two of them, how many american bastards are left to kill?'""the north korean defector was also confused about issues related to gender and language, recalling how every class would require students to tell the class their preferred pronouns. ""english is my third language.  i learned it as an adult.  i sometimes [still] say 'he' or 'she' by mistake, and now they are going to ask me to call them 'they'? how the heck do i incorporate that in my sentences?"" park asked. ""it was chaos,"" park continued.  ""it felt like the regression in civilization. ""park said she used to engage professors and fellow students in debates and arguments but learned quickly ""how to just shut up"" so she could maintain her grades and gpa. she noted that as she was growing up in north korea, she had no concept of love and liberty.  park took aim at students who told stories of being oppressed, arguing they did not know what real oppression looks like. ""because i have seen oppression, i know what it looks like,"" park said, noting she had seen 13 people die of starvation. ""these kids keep saying how they're oppressed, how much injustice they've experienced . . .  they don't know how hard it is to be free,"" she continued.  ""i literally crossed through the middle of the gobi desert to be free.  but what i did was nothing, so many people fought harder than me and didn't make it. ""park and her mother originally fled north korea when she was 13 years old, attempting to cross china's frozen yalu river when they were caught by human traffickers who sold them into slavery.  park was sold for less than $300, while her mother was sold for about $100. christian missionaries later helped park and her mother flee mongolia, after which they made the trek across the gobi desert to reach south korea. park published a memoir in 2015, titled in order to live, in which she describes her ordeal fleeing from one of the most oppressive regimes in the world. ""the people here are just dying to give their rights and power to the government.  that is what scares me the most,"" park said. she believes america's educational institutions are now stripping their students of the ability to think critically, something she compared to her educational experiences in north korea. ""in north korea, i literally believed that my dear leader [kim jong un] was starving,"" park said.  ""he's the fattest guy — how can anyone believe that? and then, somebody showed me a photo and said, 'look at him, he's the fattest guy.  other people are all thin. ' and i was like, 'oh my god, why did i not notice that he was fat?' because i never learned how to think critically. """"that is what is happening in america,"" she continued.  ""people see things, but still they've just completely lost the ability to think critically. ""park pointed out that she did not grow up with the wealth of information americans have access to on the internet, yet argued even with such access, americans now ""choose to be brainwashed.

2021-06-16,2 historic shipwrecks and their artefacts found in Singapore's territorial waters.,"singapore: two historic shipwrecks and their artefacts – including chinese ceramics from as far back as the 14th century – have been discovered within singapore's territorial waters around pedra branca island, located at the easternmost point of singapore. in 2015, several ceramic plates were discovered by accident by commercial divers involved in a maritime operation, which led to the discovery of the first historic shipwreck about 100m to the north-west of pedra branca. one year later, the national heritage board (nhb) commissioned the archaeology unit of the iseas-yusof ishak institute (iseas) to survey and investigate the site, and to conduct excavations to recover wrecks and objects from the shipwreck. these excavations, which continued until 2019, led to the discovery of a second historic shipwreck about 300m east of pedra branca.  excavations to recover artefacts from the second shipwreck were carried out from 2019 until mid-2021. artefacts recoveredthe two shipwrecks originated from different periods, according to iseas' findings. the first shipwreck contained chinese ceramics and may date back to the 14th century, a time when singapore was known as temasek, the research stated. some of the key finds include longquan dishes and bowls, and a jarlet.  fragments of blue-and-white porcelain bowls with lotus and peony motifs from the yuan dynasty were also found in the shipwreck. this ship carried more of these blue-and-white porcelain than ""any other documented shipwreck in the world,"" said dr michael flecker, a visiting fellow and project director of maritime archaeology projects at iseas. ""many of the pieces are rare, and one is believed to be unique,"" he said. iseas' research also noted that direct parallels can be made between the finds from the first shipwreck and those from archaeological excavations at empress place conducted in 2015 and from past excavations at fort canning park. the second shipwreck, noted iseas' research, is likely to be the shah munchah, a merchant vessel that sank while voyaging from china back to india in 1796. artefacts recovered from this shipwreck include a range of chinese ceramics and non-ceramic artefacts, such as copper-alloy, glass sand agate objects, as well as four anchors and nine cannons of the ship.  the cannons were typically mounted on merchant ships employed by the east india company during the 18th and early 19th centuries, and used mostly for defensive purposes and signalling. among the key non-ceramic finds in the second shipwreck were a jar shard depicting a dragon motif; an earthenware duck; figurines of guanyin's head, happy buddha and a boy of good fortune; figurines of a dog and mythical sea creature makara; a figurine of a chinese couple holding fans on a biscuit base; and a qingbai figurine of a horse with a side-saddle rider. ""had the ship survived another 23 years, she would almost certainly have called at the re-established port of singapore.  her incredibly diverse cargo provides great insights into the type of goods that would have been exchanged and purchased by the new inhabitants of this fledging city,"" said dr flecker. next steps: conservation and historical significanceafter the removal of salt via the process of desalination, the artefacts have to be meticulously cleaned, conserved and catalogued.  in-depth research and documentation will also need to be carried out. once the conservation, research and documentation have been completed, nhb will work towards exhibiting the artefacts in its museums from end-2021. archaeological reports and research might also be published by iseas.  the institute might also conduct talks for members of the public. mr yeo kirk siang, director of nhb's heritage research and assessment, told cna that the discoveries are ""significant"" in unveiling singapore's history. ""what is significant about it is it unveils part of our history before 1819.  that part is little known so far.  with every find, it enriches our understanding.  singapore's history is clearly connected to our maritime trade – in the past and even today,"" he said. ""understanding our maritime history helps us understand singapore's relations, our context and our place in the world, our geographic location, why it's important, what's the reason for our existence, and what's the reason for our success.

2021-06-16,"Video of Live Bats in Cages at Wuhan Institute of Virology Reignites Covid Origins Debate, WHO Role.","new footage from the wuhan institute of virology in china has revealed that live bats were kept in cages despite the who's claims that such a possibility was a ""conspiracy"", reigniting a debate on the origins of the coronavirus. the infamous lab is at the center of a theory that covid-19 wasn't, as many scientists believe, transmitted from bats to people via an unknown intermediary, but was instead leaked, intentionally or not, from the institute. a joint investigation by the world health organisation (who) and china into the origins of the disease had called the chance of a laboratory leak ""extremely unlikely"" and the idea that bats were held at the institute ""an error"", the nz herald reported. ""no bats were sent to wuhan lab for genetic analysis of viruses collected in the field.  that's not how this science works.  we collect bat samples, send them to the lab.  we release bats where we catch them,"" a member of the who team, zoologist dr peter daszak, wrote in a december tweet. also read | whether or not covid-19 virus leaked from lab, pathogens as weapons of mass destruction real threat""this is a widely circulated conspiracy theory.  this piece describes work i'm the lead on and labs i've collaborated with for 15 years,"" he wrote in another.  ""they do not have live or dead bats in them.  there is no evidence anywhere that this happened.  it's an error i hope will be corrected. ""earlier this month, daszak appeared to walk back his earlier denials, writing on twitter that the who team had not asked the institute if they housed bats. while the lab leak theory has recently gained traction – despite no new scientific evidence – the prospect that covid-19 jumped from bats into humans via an intermediate animal, a process known as ""zoonosis"", still remains the more likely scenario, experts have said. on tuesday, the chinese scientist at the center of theories that the coronavirus pandemic originated with a leak from her specialized lab in the city of wuhan has denied her institution was to blame for the health disaster. ""how on earth can i offer up evidence for something where there is no evidence?"" dr shi zhengli told the new york times in rare comments to the media.  ""i don't know how the world has come to this, constantly pouring filth on an innocent scientist,"" she told the us daily. the leak hypothesis had been floated earlier during the global outbreak, including by us president joe biden's predecessor donald trump, but was widely dismissed as a conspiracy theory. but it has gained increasing traction recently, fueled by reports that three researchers from the wuhan institute of virology became sick in 2019 after visiting a bat cave in the southwestern chinese province of yunnan. shi is an expert in bat coronaviruses, and some scientists have said she could have been leading so-called ""gain-of-function"" experiments in which scientists increase the strength of a virus to better study its effects on hosts. according to the new york times, in 2017 shi and her colleagues at the wuhan laboratory published a report on an experiment ""in which they created new hybrid bat coronaviruses by mixing and matching parts of several existing ones — including at least one that was nearly transmissible to humans — in order to study their ability to infect and replicate in human cells. ""but in an email to the paper, shi said her experiments differed from gain-of-function experiments since they did not seek to make a virus more dangerous.  instead they were trying to understand how the virus might jump across species. ""my lab has never conducted or cooperated in conducting gof experiments that enhance the virulence of viruses,"" she said. read all the latest news, breaking news and coronavirus news herecoca-cola lost a staggering $5. 2 billion thanks to cristiano ronaldo at euro 2020.  watch the viral moment here. the country on wednesday reported 62,224 new covid-19 infections over the past 24 hours, according to the health ministry.  the country's total covid-19 caseload now stands at 29. 63 million, while total fatalities are at 379,573 with 2,542 deaths overnight. celebrated surgeon and author of the new york times best seller ""the plant paradox"" reveals what many have suspected for a long time, and even worse. the central agencies want to ascertain whether there exists any chinese conspiracy angle to this fraud. london [uk], june 15 (ani): as the controversy around fugitive diamantaire mehul choksi's disappearance from antigua refuses to die down, a uk-based law firm looking after the case has released images and videos on monday claiming that he was kidnapped from antigua. desi twitter is experiencing waves of nostalgia in the latest trend, a throwback to mosaic flooring in middle-class households. find furniture you love, at prices that fit your budget with flexible financing. people have a lot of faith in the prime minister as opposed to the chief ministers, despite claims to the contrary. the therapy, azd7442, was 33% effective in reducing the risk of people developing symptoms compared with a placebo, but that result was not statistically significant. . new delhi, jun 15 (pti) a pan-india 'fraud-to-phone' network has been busted by security agencies, which have also arrested eight people and seized nearly 300 new mobile phones bought with stolen funds, officials said on tuesday. meet the paypal business debit card.  use it everywhere mastercard® is accepted. new delhi (reuters) -having barely got over a devastating second wave of coronavirus infections, india was gripped with alarm on tuesday over risks of a resurgence as crowds thronged railway stations and shopping malls a day after major cities relaxed curbs on movement.   the capital new delhi, in the north, and tech hub bengaluru, in the south, were among the cities that have begun lifting strict lockdowns as the nationwide tally of new infections  dropped to its lowest level in more than two months.   after a strict five-week lockdown, authorities in delhi have fully re-opened shops and malls, and allowed restaurants to have 50% seating. cashew nut trees are native to brazil but have been cultivated all over the world.  like most nuts, cashews have several health benefits and can be easily tweaked into dishes.  in addition, they are also used as an alternative to dairy products in the form of cashew milk, cashew-based cheese, and cream.  here, we cover the various health benefits of cashews. a speedy vaccination programme could compensate for the government's initial laxity displayed in covid managementthis new car cloth can easily remove all the car scratches and dents from your car. a look back at the two weeks of french open which crowned novak djokovic and barbora krejcikova as the men's and women's champions. the men allegedly forced him to chant jai sri ram, cut saifi's beard and assaulted him for 4 hours in loni. likely to be priced at rs 1,114 per dose in india, novavax vaccine will be a two-dose jab like the other vaccinesso mad that i just learned this. . . in the last few years, nearly 800,000 rohingya have fled from myanmarafter coming to power in bengal in 2011, mamata, besides working on governance, has also created more space for youngsters in the party. apple reportedly aims to provide a non-invasive solution to check blood sugar levels without pricking the skin. search for scalp psoriasis treatment options.  these treatments for scalp psoriasis are more affordable than evera 62-year-old woman died allegedly after being stabbed 20 times by a man who also sexually assaulted her in east delhi's dallupura village. hyderabad (telangana) [india], june 15 (ani): oracle india head and his wife were booked for cheating customers by collecting huge advance amounts for the projects using the goodwill of the oracle company, informed the police on tuesday. tibet is heavily restricted to foreign journalists who have little chance to visit a sensitive region that beijing says it 'peacefully liberated' in 1951.

2021-06-16,"Dickson Yeo had approached various people in Singapore, applied for government jobs to get info: ISD, Singapore News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore dickson yeo had approached various people in singapore, relying heavily on social networking platforms to reach out to them and gather information at the behest of a foreign country, said the internal security department (isd). he had also attempted to find jobs in a range of positions in the government, thinking that he could access information of interest to his foreign handlers. however, the department's investigations showed that no classified government information pertaining to singapore had been compromised as a result of yeo's activities, a spokesman told the straits times on tuesday (june 15). earlier in the day, the agency overseeing domestic security announced that yeo had been detained for two years under the internal security act (isa) for acting as a paid agent of a foreign state. he was arrested by the isd on dec 30 last year after he was deported to singapore from the united states upon completion of a 14-month jail term for spying for china in the us.  yeo was issued an order of detention under the isa on jan 29. responding to queries from the straits times, the department said yeo was tasked by his foreign handlers to gather information on a wide range of subjects, primarily global and regional geo-political issues and developments. ""he had relied heavily and successfully on social networking platforms to reach out to individuals with the relevant expertise, knowledge and access.  he had pitched taskings to his resource persons as 'research topics' for his various foreign clients. ""the isd said it was unable to provide further details on the professions of these individuals or the number of persons involved. the agency also said that yeo had tried to gain employment in a range of positions in the public sector positions and agencies he believed would allow him access to information of interest to his foreign handlers.  it added that it could not provide specific details of these jobs, citing operational and security reasons. people looking to join the public sector in positions that require access to classified information will have to undergo security clearance, the isd said.  several factors are taken into consideration in this process, including the nature of the work and the sensitivity of the information dealt with. ""security checks will vary for different positions which have different levels of access to confidential information,"" the department added. yeo's path to being a spy started during a trip to beijing in 2015, when he was recruited by chinese agents who claimed to represent think-tanks.  he was studying for a doctorate at the lee kuan yew school of public policy (lkyspp) at the national university of singapore at the time. when news of yeo's activities broke after he pleaded guilty in a us court last july, the school terminated his phd candidature ""with immediate effect"". at the time, retired diplomat bilahari kausikan revealed that one of yeo's former professors at the school was huang jing until 2017, when the academic was expelled from singapore ""for being a chinese agent of influence"". on tuesday, an lkyspp spokesman said the past incidents involving its former staff member and former student show how different sectors in society, including education, can be potential targets for foreign subversion.  the best safeguard against illegal foreign subversion is a community that is aware and vigilant, she added. the spokesman stressed that the school will not tolerate any acts or activities of foreign interference that threaten singapore's national security or interests.  its staff and students are also expected to conduct themselves fully in accordance with the laws of singapore at all times. she added that the school has strengthened its procedures, saying: ""we maintain an enhanced oversight on academic collaborations and partnerships, both local and overseas, and will also continue to keep a heightened awareness among all our staff and students on the risks of foreign interference. ""professor joseph liow, dean of the college of humanities, arts and social sciences, and tan kah kee chair in comparative and international politics at nanyang technological university, said of yeo's activities: ""academics and researchers should be aware that these sorts of things happen in real life, and are not merely the stuff of spy novels or hollywood movies. ""foreign powers spy all the time, and spying is conducted in many ways, which have evolved with technology, he noted.  and one could say that by virtue of being a very open country, singapore is vulnerable to such activities, added prof liow. ""i wouldn't say that we have to be exceedingly worried about this, but we certainly need to be aware that such things take place, and also be alert to requests that appear unusual,"" he said. ""it's not happening on a daily basis, and of course our security agencies spend a lot of time making sure such activities don't take place.  but nevertheless as academics, researchers, or just regular citizens, we need to exercise some common sense and be vigilant.

2021-06-16,Malaysian court to rule on challenge by French-Irish teen's family.,"a malaysian court will rule wednesday on a challenge by the family of a french-irish teenager over an inquest verdict that she died by misadventure after vanishing in the jungle. the body of nora quoirin, a 15-year-old with learning difficulties, was discovered after a huge hunt through the rainforest following her disappearance from a resort outside kuala lumpur in 2019. in january, a coroner handed down a ruling of misadventure, indicating her death during the family holiday was accidental rather than a crime, and said no one else was involved. but her london-based parents, who have dismissed authorities' claims their daughter wandered into the jungle alone at night, and believe she was abducted, said they were ""utterly disappointed"" by the verdict. they lodged a challenge and are seeking to have the ruling revised to an open verdict -- suggesting there are still questions to be answered about the case. judge azizul azmi adnan is expected to hand down his ruling at 5:00 pm (0900 gmt) at the high court in seremban, outside kuala lumpur, via video-link because of coronavirus curbs. presenting the family's case at a hearing last week, lawyer louise azmi said an open verdict would be ""appropriate"". ""the last thing that (nora) would do is to walk away from the security of her parents,"" she said. malaysian police have stuck to their version of events -- that the teenager clambered out of a window of the family's holiday chalet and wandered off, and insist there was no sign of foul play. but her mother, meabh, has said she believes someone could have placed her body in the spot where it was found, not far from the resort. the teenager disappeared a day after her family checked in to the dusun resort, triggering a 10-day hunt involving hundreds of rescuers, helicopters and sniffer dogs. an autopsy concluded she likely died of starvation and internal bleeding. the coroner said the teenager had been left disoriented by the long journey from britain to malaysia, likely leading her to wander off, and that there was no sign she was murdered or sexually assaulted. the teen had a condition known as holoprosencephaly, where the brain fails to develop normally.  she had limited verbal communication and could only write a few words. bur-sr/hgbeijing's new top diplomat in hong kong, who called the battle against ""foreign forces"" his top priority after taking the job last

2021-06-16,NTU Singapore’s new mini robots can swim like jellyfish and build micro-devices.,"
by sam cox

3 hours ago47 views from left: lum guo zhan, yang zilin and xu changyu.  image: ntu singaporetiny robots with advanced dexterity and manoeuvrability could have applications in drug delivery and the construction of micro-structures. scientists at nanyang technological university, singapore have developed tiny robots that can perform precision movements when controlled using magnetic fields. focused on optimising the millimetre-sized robots' movement in three-dimensional space, the researchers increased the precision of available control capability along the three spatial axes as well as rotating between them (commonly known as roll, pitch and yaw). of these six degrees of freedom, the new ntu singapore miniature robots are capable of rotating 43 times faster than previous generations in the critical sixth degree of freedom. using a control computer, scientists can precisely vary the strength and direction of magnetic fields generated by an electromagnetic coil system.  by embedding magnetic microparticles into their miniature robots, ntu singapore researchers could control them through the application of these magnetic fields. these robots are often no bigger than a grain of rice and may be made from 'soft' materials such as biocompatible polymers.  these materials are non-toxic to humans and are well-suited to integration with the magnetic components. the researchers highlighted the possible applications of this technology through showcasing a jellyfish-inspired robot capable of swimming in water and squeezing past a tight barrier.  in doing so, they argued the possibility of putting these robots to work in hard-to-reach places, such as surgical procedures in the brain, or drug delivery elsewhere in the body. another 'gripper robot' assembled a three-dimensional structure in less than five minutes – 20 times faster than previous generations of mini robots.  this was intended to demonstrate a potential application in manufacturing and the establishment of 'micro-factories'. the research was published in the journal advanced materials in may 2021 and featured as the front cover for its 10 june issue. lum guo zhan, lead author of the study and assistant professor at the school of mechanical and aerospace engineering in ntu singapore, said the breakthrough came in discovering an ""elusive"" third and final principal vector of the applied magnetic fields, which is necessary for controlling such machines. ""by fully understanding the physics of these miniature robots, we are now able to accurately control their motions,"" said lum. he claimed his team's proposed fabrication method can magnetise mini robots to produce six-degrees-of-freedom torques magnitudes larger than existing devices. ""our findings are therefore pivotal, and they represent a significant advancement for small-scale robotic technologies,"" lum added. phd students xu changyu and yang zilin, co-authors of the research, said, ""besides surgery, our robots may also be of value in biomedical applications such as assembling lab-on-chip devices that can be used for clinical diagnostics by integrating several laboratory processes on a single chip. ""the research team now aims to make their robots even smaller, on the scale of a few hundred micrometres, and to ultimately make the robots fully autonomous. related:

""this is the first death where causality has been established, with vaccine resulting in an anaphylaxis reaction.  but compared to the overall numbers, only a small number had a severe reaction.  31 cases were investigated and one death was due to vaccine, and among anaphylaxis cases, only two were found to be product-related.  most anaphylaxis reactions are managed,"" said nk arora, advisor, national aefi committee. of 31 cases, three cases were reported as ""anaphylaxis"" or any severe reaction experienced by the person half an hour after the shot.  two of them were hospitalized and discharged but one died. eighteen cases were found to be unrelated to vaccines and classified as ""coincidental"".  there were two cases of hospitalisation linked to vaccines. in seven cases, there is no definite evidence to link the deaths to vaccines.  in the case of two cases, there is not enough information. ""overall, the benefits of vaccination are overwhelmingly greater than the small risk of harm,"" the health ministry said. ""mere reporting of deaths and hospitalizations as serious adverse events did not automatically imply that the events were caused due to vaccines.  data from the first week of april shows the reporting rate is 2. 7 deaths per million vaccine doses administered and 4. 8 hospitalizations per million vaccine doses administered,"" the ministry explained. track latest news live on ndtv. com and get news updates from india and around the world.  watch live news:follow us:. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  advertisement . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

2021-06-16,Commentary: G7 summit proved the world has shifted after Trump.,"the leaders pointedly reiterated liberal democracies' commitment to multilateralism, says a foreign affairs observer. melbourne: what a difference a year makes in international diplomacy. a year ago, then-us president donald trump was obliged to abandon his plans for a g7 summit at the presidential retreat of camp david outside washington. various excuses were advanced by participants, including the inadvisability of travelling across the world in the midst of a pandemic.  but in reality few, if any, g7 leaders wanted to associate themselves with trump in what was hoped would be the last days of an ill-starred presidency. a year later, these same leaders gathered at an english coastal retreat – in the shadow of a persistent covid-19 pandemic – to celebrate the end of a disruptive chapter in diplomatic history. relief was palpable in the interactions of representatives of the united states, united kingdom, france, germany, japan, italy and canada. america was back, not in its ""america first"" guise, but as the proclaimed leader of the free world, to use an old-fashioned description. however, in the four years of the trump presidency, during which washington effectively abandoned its global leadership role in favour of an inward-looking posture defined by its embrace of an america first doctrine, the world had changed, and shifted dramatically. in 2016, the final year of the obama administration, the g7 summit in japan focused on the issue of climate in the wake of the paris agreement signed in april of that year.  its other priorities were disputes in the south china sea and, interestingly enough, the need to strengthen a global response to pandemics in light of experiences with the ebola virus in africa. that global response has been found to be inadequate.  this prompts the question: what notice did global health authorities, principally the world health organization, take of the g7's 2016 communique?china, the primary g7 concernfive years later, the challenges identified in the 2016 document have been vastly magnified.  this has been brought about by a combination of lack of us leadership on issues such as climate, and a broader global failure to manage china's rise. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid. in 2016, china's activities in the south china sea in defiance of the united nations convention on the law of the sea (unclos) were a growing concern, as were signs of its increasing assertiveness under its nationalist leader, xi jinping. but the consensus view then was that china's rise could be accommodated without undue disruption to a rules-based international order.  that has proved a significant miscalculation. fast-forward to the 2021 g7 in cornwall, where concerns about china's rise in its various dimensions stalked the round-table discussions and bilateral meetings.  no other issue came close to matching worries about china: not climate change, nor the ongoing challenges of the pandemic. in the end, the g7 communique was relatively restrained on china.  this reflected differences of opinion among participants about how to manage a difficult situation. the us and canadians would have liked stronger language.  the europeans favoured a less hawkish approach.  japan was somewhere in the middle. pointed references to chinareferences to china were nevertheless pointed, in contrast to previous g7 communiques, which have danced around the issue of beijing's challenges to a rules-based global order. from an australian perspective, the communique's reference to china's resort to economic reprisals to punish those who found themselves at odds with its policies will have been welcome:with regard to china, and the competition in the global economy, we will continue to consult on collective approaches to challenging non-market policies and practices which undermine the fair and transparent operation of the global economy. on human rights, the g7 was commendably forthright:we will promote our values by calling on china to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, especially in relation to xinjiang and those rights, freedoms and high degree of autonomy for hong kong enshrined in the sino-british joint declaration and the basic law. significantly, taiwan made its way into a g7 communique for the first time.  here, the world's leading democracies issued a fairly blunt warning to beijing not to further destabilise relations across the taiwan strait:we underscore the importance of peace and stability across the taiwan strait, and encourage the peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues.  we remain seriously concerned about the situation in the east and south china seas and strongly oppose any unilateral attempt to change the status quo and increase tensions. predictably, chinese commentators dismissed the g7 process as a sideshow, claiming ""the world's economic and political centre of gravity had shifted"", as the global times put it. awkward position for morrisonmorrison, as an official guest, will have been relieved the g7 did not reach a consensus on the timing for a phase-out of coal for generating electric power. on the other hand, he will not have overlooked strong language in the communique calling for a commitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions ""as soon as possible"". australia will have had no issue with other g7 initiatives such as calls for a global minimum tax to ensure greater global equity.  nor will it object to a proposal for liberal democracies to contribute to an infrastructure fund to compete with china's belt and road initiative in the developing world. morrison will no doubt have been disappointed he did not have a ""one-on-one"" meeting with us president joe biden.  instead, he had to make do with a three-way conversation involving the summit's host, uk prime minister boris johnson. it is not clear whether this was a snub, but those briefing journalists in advance of the g7 should not have raised expectations. in one respect, morrison will have found the cornwall g7 awkward.  no other leader of a western liberal democracy had aligned themselves as closely with the trump white house. in his attempts to position himself alongside trump, morrison echoed the then us president's antagonism towards international institutions, broadly summed up by the morrison's reference to ""negative globalism"" in a lowy institute speech in 2019. these were sentiments the former us president used to promote his version of an america first policy, in contrast to the multilateralist tendencies of his predecessors. morrison's adoption of this trumpism, now quietly discarded in his public statements, sits uncomfortably with the new president's emphasis on washington's global leadership in partnership with like-minded countries and institutions. pointedly, the g7 communique reiterated liberal democracies' commitment to ""multilateralism"". if nothing else, australia's prime minister should have concluded in cornwall that his own personal investment in a trump presidency was not the most prudent course.  the world has shifted. tony walker is vice-chancellor's fellow at la trobe university.  this commentaryfirst appearedon the conversation.

2021-06-16,Football: France's Pogba lucky to have perfect sidekick in Kante.,"munich: france midfielder paul pogba earned the star of the match award for his display in the world champions' 1-0 win over germany in their euro 2020 group f opener on tuesday but knows how lucky he is to play alongside n'golo kante. powerhouse pogba's sublime pass in the 20th minute unlocked germany's defence, allowing lucas hernandez to drive in a cross that germany's mats hummels turned into his own net. pogba, 28, delivered several other moments of quality as the link between france's midfield and the dream attacking trident of antoine griezmann, kylian mbappe and karim benzema. adrien rabiot was also a disciplined presence in didier deschamps' midfield that was ultimately far too crafty for a german side that looked short of cohesion. but it was chelsea's kante, who at the age of 30 appears to be elevating his games to new levels, who knitted it together. a few weeks after his masterful display helped chelsea overcome favourites manchester city in the champions league final, kante again showed that he remains the beating heart of world champions france. when required as a defensive shield in the second half, as germany tried to build some momentum, kante was immense. almost inevitably, kante was also in close proximity whenever france turned over possession using the ball efficiently and with no little vision. pogba's manchester united career has spluttered at times, yet when playing for france, kante's influence rubs off on him to such an extent that he looks like a world-beater. in the 28 games he has started for france with kante, les blues have won 22, drawn six and lost none. ""pogba was absolutely immense tonight,"" france's euro 2000 winner robert pires told uefa's website.  ""we know all about his technique.  he's back to his best, physically. ""pogba's words after the game would have been music to the ears of deschamps, as he attempts to add the european crown to the world cup his side won in russia in 2018. ""we know we need to live up to our tag as world champions and come out on to the pitch with humility,"" pogba said. ""when we need to suffer, we do it together and when we attack, we do it together,"" added the midfielder, who said this week how much of an honour it was to play alongside kante. eight of france's starting team against germany played in the 2018 world cup final win over croatia and, while it was not a five-star display, they won with something to spare as both benzema and mbappe had goals ruled out for offside. those looking for weaknesses were left disappointed as france's unbeaten run in competitive matches reached 17. ""we spent all night talking about france's attacking players, but again another clean sheet,"" former manchester united skipper roy keane told itv sport.  ""that's a defence that can win them the title.  they are brilliant at the back.

2021-06-16,Slowest population growth in Singapore since independence: Census 2020.,"singapore: singapore's total population saw its lowest decade of growth since independence between 2010 and 2020, increasing by 1. 1 per cent a year a slowdown from the 2. 5 per cent per year between 2000 and 2010. this was among the findings released on wednesday (jun 16) by the department of statistics (dos) in its first statistical release from its census of the population in 2020.  more information from the census will be released on friday. the census – singapore's largest national statistical exercise – is conducted once a decade to collect demographic, social and economic data, among others.  it surveyed 150,000 households last year. ""it tells us where we were, where we're at now, and identifies some of the things that we need to address going forward,"" said indranee rajah, minister in the prime minister's office, who oversees the national population and talent division. though some of the data will be affected as the survey was done amid the covid-19 pandemic, she said the census captures ""broad trends over the decade . . .  notwithstanding the blips over the last one and a half years"". the total population increased from 5. 08 million in 2010 to5. 69 millionin 2020.  within this, the citizen population grew from 3. 23 million to 3. 52 million, while the permanent resident population remained ""stable"" at around 0. 5 million, it added. the number of non-residents increased from 1. 31 million to 1. 64 million. ms indranee pointed out that singapore citizens accounted for a greater proportion of the growth this decade, while non-residents grew at a slower rate than before. the dos also said ethnic compositions for citizen and resident populations remained stable. at the same time, the country's population continued to age.  in 2020, 15. 2 per cent of the resident population was aged 65 and above, up from 9 per cent in 2010. the median age of the resident population also rose to 41. 5 years in 2020, up from 37. 4 years in 2010. rise in singlehoodthe census showed that singlehood has become more prevalent across multiple age groups over the last decade – particularly among younger residents aged 25 to 34. the proportion of singles rose among all age groups that fell within the bracket of 20 to 49 years old. the largest increase in the proportion of single people was seen among those aged 25 to 29.  the proportion of single women in this group rose from 54 per cent in 2010 to 69 per cent, while single men grew from 74. 6 per cent to 81. 6 per cent in this age group. not far behind were those aged 30 to 34: the proportion of single women in this bracket went up from 25. 1 per cent to 32. 8 per cent, while that of men increased from 37. 1 per cent to 41. 9 per cent. when sorted by ethnic group, data showed that the chinese had the highest proportion of singles. for instance, in 2020, among residents aged 40 to 49, about 17. 4 per cent and 18. 6 per cent of chinese men and women were single. this was higher than 15 per cent and 9. 2 per cent for malay men and women respectively, and 6. 2 and 6. 3 per cent for indian men and women. fewer children bornat the same time, women generally had fewer children in 2020 compared to a decade before, said the dos. among female residents aged 15 and above who have ever been married, the average number of children born fell across all age brackets.  the average decreased from 2. 24 children per woman in 2010, to 2. 04 in 2020. lower averages were also seen across all educational groups, said the dos, adding that the largest decrease was observed among women with below secondary qualifications. in 2010, women in this group aged 40 to 49 had an average of 2. 21 children, but in 2020, this figure fell to 2. 01. still, in line with previous trends, higher educated females had fewer children on average than those with lower educational qualifications. among these female residents aged 40 to 49, university graduates had an average of 1. 66 children in 2020 – lower than the average of 1. 94 children among those with secondary qualifications, the dos said. education levels improvethe educational profile of the resident population improved between 2010 and 2020. in 2020, among residents aged 25 and above, nearly six in ten had post-secondary or higher qualifications.  this is up from less than five in 10 in 2010. ""the chinese, malay and indian communities all saw improvements in their educational attainment,"" added the dos. it also noted that women have ""made more significant progress"" in this aspect. for instance, among residents aged 55 and over in 2020, the proportion of men with post-secondary or higher qualifications was 11. 2 percentage points higher than that of women. this narrowed to a 2. 4 percentage-point difference among those aged 35 to 44. among those aged 25 to 34, the proportion for women – at 90. 2 per cent marginally beat the figure for men, which was 90 per cent. overall, literacy rates rose to 97. 1 per cent in 2020, up from 95. 9 per cent in 2010. across all age groups, multi-language literacy rates were also higher or remained stable. there was an overall increase in english literacy across the three major ethnic groups, the dos noted. relevance of sorting data by ethnic groupsat a press conference on the release of the data, ms indranee was asked by reporters about the continued relevance of separating data by ethnic categories, given that there may be sharp inequalities even within these groups. ms indranee said being a multi-racial and multi-religious state is ""a constant work in progress"". ""(this) also means that you don't really ever get to a post-race situation where it doesn't matter at all. ""she added: ""if you didn't have this data then let's say that a particular ethnic group was not doing well compared to the others.  you will have no idea how many, you will have no idea in what areas, you wouldn't know whether the problem was education, or whether the problem was something else. ""all you would have is just one big blob of data, and you will have no ability to say, actually this group is not doing so well.  what are the reasons, how can we help, what are the interventions that we can make?""""the thinking behind this data is: to the extent that any group may not be doing as well as any others in any areas, then it tells us that as a society in terms of policy, then we should do something to try and make sure that we can bridge any gap.

2021-06-16,Opinion.,"advertisementsupported byguest essayby elena chernenkoms.  chernenko is a special correspondent for kommersant, an independent newspaper in russia. moscow — for a while, it wasn't clear that this week's meeting in geneva between president vladimir putin of russia and president biden would go ahead. mr.  biden, seeking his first encounter as president with mr.  putin, made the invitation in mid-april; but it took until the end of may for the summit to be confirmed.  despite mr.  putin's experience with american presidents — he's dealt with four, across two decades — the kremlin, russian officials said, was considering the risk that mr.  biden would use the meeting to publicly lecture his russian counterpart on democracy and human rights. the caution seemed reasonable.  after all, the new american administration, especially by comparison with its predecessor, devotes considerable attention to promoting human rights across the globe.  and mr.  biden set out his stall when he agreed in an interview in march that mr.  putin is a ""killer. ""yet the kremlin eventually accepted the invitation.  why? besides the chance to de-escalate tensions, there's one very good reason: mr.  putin has nothing to fear from mr.  biden.  enduringly popular and freshly buoyed by the quashing of the opposition, russia's president has ample cause to feel secure.  whatever the american president might say in geneva — or his administration do, by way of sanctions — will not affect mr.  putin's rule in russia. the first impediment for mr.  biden is straightforward: his message will not get a good airing.  television, dominated by channels run or controlled by the state, remains the main source of news for three-quarters of russians, so most people in russia will see the american president through the kremlin's eyes.  independent media, recently curtailed by the authorities declaring several prominent outlets to be ""foreign agents,"" won't be able to redress the imbalance. yet even without this media filter, mr.  putin has no reason to fear any aspersions mr.  biden might cast his way.  though the president's popularity has waned a touch since its peak in 2014, he retains the trust and approval of over 60 percent of russians, according to levada center, an independent and highly respected polling organization.  this might be more inertia and apathy than a conscious political affiliation, but the result is the same.  the opposition can only dream about such ratings: support for the most prominent opposition leader, aleksei navalny, doesn't rise above 20 percent. the blame for that can't be placed squarely on the kremlin.  though the opposition is hampered by a range of state restrictions, the fact remains that opposition rallies do not attract significant numbers of participants.  the last big protest in support of mr.  navalny — one of the largest displays of dissent in the past decade — brought between 51,000 and 120,000 people to 109 cities across the country on april 21, according to opposition outlets.  but even if you take the higher number, that amounts to less than 0. 1 percent of the country's population.  protesting is a minority interest. and that's not just because russian authorities have repeatedly demonstrated their willingness to brutally suppress gatherings.  many people unhappy with life in russia stay away from protests because they don't associate themselves with the organizers and don't believe they can bring about change from the street.  in a recent survey by the levada center, only 21 percent of respondents said they would consider going to a rally in support of economic demands, and even fewer, 16 percent, said they'd go in support of political demands.  there are demographic divides — young people are generally more eager to protest — but that doesn't really change the picture. what's more, those ready to actively challenge mr.  putin's rule have been repressed.  mr.  navalny, who returned to the country in january in the hope of setting off a substantive movement to oppose mr.  putin, was imprisoned with a two-and-a-half-year sentence.  many of his allies were jailed, while others fled the country.  and last week, his organization, the anti-corruption foundation, whose activities were already suspended, was officially labeled ""extremist"" — effectively preventing its activists from running in future elections and further intimidating supporters. it's not just mr.  navalny.  another opposition network — open russia, founded by a former oil tycoon and now exiled kremlin critic, mikhail khodorkovsky — recently announced its closure, hoping to protect its coordinators.  that didn't stop the arrest on may 31 of one of the group's executives, andrey pivovarov, who now faces up to six years in prison.  fearing the same fate, another prominent opposition figure, dmitry gudkov, fled to ukraine in early june. ahead of september's legislative elections, the authorities have disbanded the opposition and docked the media, closing down the space for dissent.  but a majority of russians, consumed by the concerns of everyday life and long inured to mr.  putin's rule, don't seem to care much.  with them, mr.  biden's message about the inviolability of human rights and the sanctity of democracy — both of which are slipping away in russia, to no general uproar — is likely to ring hollow. even among russians who actively support democracy, the rule of law and human rights, mr.  biden won't find much support.  over the past decades, many russian liberals have become disillusioned with the west, especially the united states.  for some, america's image started to crack with the bombing of yugoslavia and the war in iraq.  for others, it was the revelations of wikileaks and edward snowden, which brought to light a host of america's covert operations and dirty dealings, that soured feelings of admiration. and for many, the presidency of donald trump — during which washington abandoned international agreements, treated allies as clients, badly mismanaged the pandemic and, most important, exacerbated political polarization and social dysfunction — definitively stripped america of its authority.  with this legacy, no american president would have a substantial audience in russia. secure internally and with little to lose, vladimir putin is ready for president biden.  as for his image in the united states and the rest of the west, it's fair to assume — after years as their arch-villain and evil mastermind — that mr.  putin couldn't care less. elena chernenko (@elenachernenko) is special

made the invitation in mid-april; but it took until the end of may for the summit to be confirmed.', ""despite mr.  putin's experience with american presidents — he's dealt with four, across two decades — the kremlin, russian officials said, was considering the risk that mr.  biden would use the meeting to publicly lecture his russian counterpart on democracy and human rights."", 'the caution seemed reasonable.', 'after all, the new american administration, especially by comparison with its predecessor, devotes considerable attention to promoting human rights across the globe.', 'and mr.  biden set out his stall when he agreed in an interview in march that mr.  putin is a ""killer.', '""yet the kremlin eventually accepted the invitation.', 'why?', ""besides the chance to de-escalate tensions, there's one very good reason: mr.  putin has nothing to fear from mr.  biden."", ""enduringly popular and freshly buoyed by the quashing of the opposition, russia's president has ample cause to feel secure."", ""whatever the american president might say in geneva — or his administration do, by way of sanctions — will not affect mr.  putin's rule in russia."", 'the first impediment for mr.  biden is straightforward: his message will not get a good airing.', ""television, dominated by channels run or controlled by the state, remains the main source of news for three-quarters of russians, so most people in russia will see the american president through the kremlin's eyes."", 'independent media, recently curtailed by the authorities declaring several prominent outlets to be ""foreign agents,"" won\'t be able to redress the imbalance.', 'yet even without this media filter, mr.  putin has no reason to fear any aspersions mr.  biden might cast his way.', ""though the president's popularity has waned a touch since its peak in 2014, he retains the trust and approval of over 60 percent of russians, according to levada center, an independent and highly respected polling organization."", 'this might be more inertia and apathy than a conscious political affiliation, but the result is the same.', ""the opposition can only dream about such ratings: support for the most prominent opposition leader, aleksei navalny, doesn't rise above 20 percent."", ""the blame for that can't be placed squarely on the kremlin."", 'though the opposition is hampered by a range of state restrictions, the fact remains that opposition rallies do not attract significant numbers of participants.', 'the last big protest in support of mr.  navalny — one of the largest displays of dissent in the past decade — brought between 51,000 and 120,000 people to 109 cities across the country on april 21, according to opposition outlets.', 'but even if you take the higher number, that amounts to less than 0.', ""1 percent of the country's population."", 'protesting is a minority interest.', ""and that's not just because russian authorities have repeatedly demonstrated their willingness to brutally suppress gatherings."", ""many people unhappy with life in russia stay away from protests because they don't associate themselves with the organizers and don't believe they can bring about change from the street."", ""in a recent survey by the levada center, only 21 percent of respondents said they would consider going to a rally in support of economic demands, and even fewer, 16 percent, said they'd go in support of political demands."", ""there are demographic divides — young people are generally more eager to protest — but that doesn't really change the picture."", ""what's more, those ready to actively challenge mr.  putin's rule have been repressed."", 'mr.  navalny, who returned to the country in january in the hope of setting off a substantive movement to oppose mr.  putin, was imprisoned with a two-and-a-half-year sentence.', 'many of his allies were jailed, while others fled the country.', 'and last week, his organization, the anti-corruption foundation, whose

mr.  navalny."", 'another opposition network — open russia, founded by a former oil tycoon and now exiled kremlin critic, mikhail khodorkovsky — recently announced its closure, hoping to protect its coordinators.', ""that didn't stop the arrest on may 31 of one of the group's executives, andrey pivovarov, who now faces up to six years in prison."", 'fearing the same fate, another prominent opposition figure, dmitry gudkov, fled to ukraine in early june.', ""ahead of september's legislative elections, the authorities have disbanded the opposition and docked the media, closing down the space for dissent."", ""but a majority of russians, consumed by the concerns of everyday life and long inured to mr.  putin's rule, don't seem to care much."", ""with them, mr.  biden's message about the inviolability of human rights and the sanctity of democracy — both of which are slipping away in russia, to no general uproar — is likely to ring hollow."", ""even among russians who actively support democracy, the rule of law and human rights, mr.  biden won't find much support."", 'over the past decades, many russian liberals have become disillusioned with the west, especially the united states.', ""for some, america's image started to crack with the bombing of yugoslavia and the war in iraq."", ""for others, it was the revelations of wikileaks and edward snowden, which brought to light a host of america's covert operations and dirty dealings, that soured feelings of admiration."", 'and for many, the presidency of donald trump — during which washington abandoned international agreements, treated allies as clients, badly mismanaged the pandemic and, most important, exacerbated political polarization and social dysfunction — definitively stripped america of its authority.',

2021-06-16,"Students negotiate a tough road towards milestone exams, Latest Singapore News.","the second nationwide home-based learning (hbl) exercise for students will come to an end in stages, the ministry of education (moe) announced yesterday. primary 4 to 6 pupils, secondary 3 to 5 and all junior college and millennia institute students will be the first to return to school on june 28.  secondary 1 and 2 students will return to school from july 1 and the rest will go back from july 6. those sitting psle and n-, o- and a-level examinations this year have had to live with the coronavirus for more than a year now and been forced to make unprecedented adjustments while preparing for the milestone tests. dr jason tan, associate professor in the policy, curriculum and leadership academic group at the national institute of education, said negotiating two hbl sessions and adjusting to various safety measures both in and out of school would have been challenging. ""these exams play an important role in determining the next stages of the students' lives and having them amid the disruptions caused by the virus is certainly not ideal,"" he told the new paper yesterday. ""this period is already a stressful one for them, knowing the importance of these exams.  faced with social isolation like being apart from their classmates and not having co-curricular activities is bound to affect their social and emotional well-being, which also plays a part in how they do academically. ""on may 16, moe announced that all students would move to hbl from may 19, the second such exercise since the virus appeared here early last year. the current mid-year holidays started on may 29 and end on june 27. last year's hbl was from april 8 to may 5, during the circuit breaker, when singapore went into a lockdown from april 7 to june 1. ms vivien le, founder of le xue education group, a chinese education centre, believes many of the students taking crucial exams this year would have found it tough. the former moe teacher said: ""this year's cohort had to go through two rounds of disruptions. ""students who find it more challenging learning online may find it difficult since a portion of their syllabus from these two years were taught online, especially when it comes to the foundation topics taught last year. ""but she noted that some learning styles may be suited to online learning. miss ren yun ting, 18, a second-year student at tampines meridian junior college, said she was productive during the recent hbl exercise as she continued preparing for her upcoming a-level exams. she said: ""the school uploaded a lot of information and resources such as mock exam papers for us to do, and i had the flexibility to plan my time on how i wanted to revise. ""while she missed meeting her friends and having fun in school, the time she saved on travelling and attending co-curricular activity sessions helped with revision work. ""i may not be able to say i am 100 per cent confident to take the exams now, but i am definitely making great use of my holidays to consolidate my learning, and i am well prepared for my upcoming exams, which is an important milestone before the a levels,"" she added. some have struggled more. madam lunny liu, 50, a tutor, said her 11-year-old daughter, who will sit the primary school leaving examination later this year, found the hbl less effective. ""she never had very good self-discipline and home-based learning made it worse.  also, it affected her understanding of some lessons taught in class because she does better with physical interaction. ""students taking the psle and n-, o- and a-level exams face huge pressure, and ms le said the pandemic could exacerbate the strain. a mother who wanted to be known only as mrs lim said despite the challenges that her 12-year-old daughter has had to face, they have learnt to adapt as the psle draws closer. the 41-year-old sales manager said: ""last year, my daughter was complaining about the safe management measures in school such as having to wear masks the whole day. ""she does not complain now and is looking forward to returning to school to prepare for her exams. ""while it has been disruptive, especially when tuition classes were shifted online, this pandemic has taught us to go with the flow and expect these constant changes.

""i wish to give my commitment that the parliament meeting can be held in this phase, around september or october, with tight standard operating procedures (sops) in place,"" he said when unveiling the plan in a televised address. mr muhyiddin said this had been his stance since early on that malaysia's system of parliamentary democracy could function again at the appropriate time when covid-19 cases were under control and the country nearly reached herd immunity. ""i will continue to support the principles of parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy. ""don't let there be any parties who purposely create unrest and disorder among the people to the extent of hindering the government's main task to handle the pandemic,"" mr muhyiddin said. the national recovery plan is a four-phase covid-19 exit strategy beginning with the current total lockdown.  daily covid-19 cases, intensive care unit occupancy and vaccination rate are the three indicators for the country to transition from one phase to another. to enter phase three, daily cases have to fall below 2,000, the public healthcare capacity is at a comfortable level with enough icu beds, and 40 per cent of malaysia's population has received both vaccine doses, mr muhyiddin said.

""(the fourth phase) is when we can return to normal daily life as much as possible.  all economic sectors will open, more social activities will be permitted, interstate travel will be allowed and domestic tourism will also reopen with strict sops,"" he said. mr muhyiddin stressed that the national recovery plan is dynamic and the government would decide to move into the next phase when the three thresholds are achieved. in january, malaysian king al-sultan abdullah ri'ayatuddin al-mustafa billah shah had proclaimed a state of emergency in malaysia to help curb covid-19's spread.  it is set to end on aug 1 or earlier depending on the state of the pandemic. with the state of emergency in place, bothparliament and state legislature sittings, as well as elections,are suspended while economic activities are allowed to continue. since last week, the king hasheld a series of audiences with 18 key political leaders, including opposition leader anwar ibrahim and former prime minister mahathir mohamad, for discussions on malaysia's current state of emergency and covid-19 efforts. in a statement on tuesday, the palace said their views would be presented in the special malay rulers' meeting at 2. 30pm on wednesday. rm1 billion daily loss during total lockdownsince the pandemic, the malaysian government has rolled out stimulus packages worth rm380 billion (us$92 billion) in total. in his tuesday address, mr muhyiddin noted that the country suffered an economic loss of rm1 billion daily during the current lockdown. ""we cannot carry on like this.  for health and the continuation of all our lives, we need to get out of this crisis quickly,"" he said. the prime minister urged those yet to register for their vaccine to do so through the mysejahtera application. ""until now, the total number of registrations are at 13. 8 million.  our target is to ensure at least 26 million of malaysia's population are vaccinated by the end of the year to achieve herd immunity,"" he said. he added that 1. 4 people are fully vaccinated so far, while 3. 2 million people have received their first dose. the prime minister said he hoped the national recovery plan could guide the country towards reclaiming the ""much treasured freedoms"" while doing all it could to protect the lives and livelihoods of malaysians.

2021-06-16,ICC seeks probe into Philippines drug war killings.,"the hague: the international criminal court's chief prosecutor on monday (jun 14) sought a full investigation into crimes against humanity during the philippines' ""war on drugs"", in one of her last acts before stepping down this week. fatou bensouda asked judges at the world's only permanent war crimes court to authorise a probe into allegations that police unlawfully killed as many as tens of thousands of civilians between 2016 and 2019. the philippines left the icc in 2019 after the court launched a preliminary examination into president rodrigo duterte's drug crackdown, but bensouda said it could still investigate crimes committed while manila was a member. ""i have determined that there is a reasonable basis to believe that the crime against humanity of murder has been committed . .  in the context of the government of philippines 'war on drugs' campaign,"" bensouda said in a statement. ""the available information indicates that members of the philippine national police, and others acting in concert with them, have unlawfully killed between several thousand and tens of thousands of civilians"" during the period under investigation. gambian lawyer bensouda, whose term of office ends on tuesday, said that ""any authorised investigation in the philippines will fall to my able successor, mr karim khan, to take forward"". britain's khan will be sworn in on wednesday with a host of other challenges in his inbox including a probe into israel and the palestinian territories. thousands of civiliansduterte's drug crackdown has drawn international censure and prompted the icc to launch its preliminary probe three years ago. the crackdown is duterte's signature policy initiative and he defends it fiercely, especially from critics like western leaders and institutions which he says do not care about his country. he was elected in 2016 on a campaign promise to get rid of the philippines' drug problem, openly ordering police to kill drug suspects if their lives are in danger. more than 6,000 people have been killed in over 200,000 anti-drug operations conducted since july 2016, according to official data.  human rights groups estimate the number of dead could be several times higher. many suspects have been put on ""drug watch lists"" by local officials and then visited by police at their homes a situation which often ends in a deadly shooting that officers claim was self-defence. amnesty international said the icc investigation was a ""landmark step"". ""this announcement is a moment of hope for thousands of families in the philippines who are grieving those lost to the government's so-called 'war on drugs',"" amnesty head agnes callamard said in a statement. human rights watch said the court had ""dealt a blow"" for duterte's ""presumption of impunity"" for the killings. 'drugh watch lists'the tough-talking duterte has repeatedly claimed the icc has no jurisdiction over him and that he will not cooperate with what he has called an ""illegal"" probe.  he even threatened to arrest bensouda. duterte has previously told the tribunal that the country's justice system is working amid allegations that local courts cannot or are unwilling to prosecute suspects in the killings one of the criteria for the icc to open a full investigation. duterte has said he is willing to go behind bars if proven guilty in the philippine judicial system. ""if the court says that i should go to jail, i will go to jail.  that's no problem.  i did what i embarked to do,"" duterte said in a televised speech in december 2020. bensouda said previous cases showed that the icc ""retains jurisdiction over crimes that are alleged to have occurred on the territory of that state during the period when it was a state party"" to the international court. she added that the court ""does not take a position on any government's internal policies"" to combat drugs but that it was acting under its mandate to investigate war crimes and crimes against humanity. the court would also investigate allegations of torture and other ""inhumane acts"" dating back as far as 2011, it said. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-16,Japan should have scrapped domestic trials to speed up COVID-19 inoculations: Vaccine chief.,"tokyo: japan's requirement of domestic clinical trials for covid-19 vaccines cost it precious time in inoculating its population, vaccine programme chief taro kono said on tuesday (jun 15). about 4. 8 per cent of japan's population has been fully vaccinated, a reuters tracker shows, the lowest rate among large, wealthy economies at a time when tens of thousands of visitors are poised to arrive for the tokyo olympics starting on jul 23. ""if i could go back all the way to the beginning, i would have probably scrapped the clinical trial that we did,"" kono told reporters. ""it's probably necessary for ordinary times, but in the case of emergency, or state of emergency, like covid-19, i think we should have started the vaccination as early as possible. ""japan's mid-february start of vaccinations lagged behind most major economies and was dependent on initially scarce doses of pfizer-biontech's vaccine imported from overseas. kono, the administrative reform minister tapped to head the programme in january, said that opposition parties pushed for domestic trials, and that media would have pilloried the government if accidents had happened without them. but some public health experts have said that the domestic trials, involving 200 subjects or fewer, were scientifically meaningless. in recent weeks, the vaccine campaign has picked up steam and is set to accelerate now that thousands of companies have signed up to use government supplies to administer shots to employees and families. kono said he hoped that daily vaccinations would hit 1 million by the end of june, up from about 700,000 now. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-16,NY Lifts Most Coronavirus Restrictions.,"advertisementsupported byofficials made the move after more than 70 percent of adults in both states had received a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine. by luis ferré-sadurní and shawn hublerthe governors of new york and california, the states hit earliest and hardest by the pandemic, triumphantly announced on tuesday that they had lifted virtually all coronavirus restrictions on businesses and social gatherings as both states hit milestones in vaccinating their residents.  in new york, where 70 percent of adults have received at least one dose of the vaccine, the order from gov.  andrew m.  cuomo means that restaurants will no longer be forced to space tables six feet apart; movie theaters will be allowed to pack their auditoriums without spacing seats apart; and entering commercial buildings won't require a temperature check. ""this is a momentous day and we deserve it because it has been a long, long road,"" mr.  cuomo said at the world trade center in lower manhattan on tuesday, adding that the changes meant a ""return to life as we know it. "" in california, where 72 percent of adults have received at least one dose of the vaccine, gov.  gavin newsom called tuesday ""reopening day,"" as he lifted similar capacity limits on businesses and social distancing requirements, with some exceptions. businesses in both states, however, will still have the option of requiring health precautions on their premises.  the two governors, both democrats who are facing political difficulties, made their announcements at events that seemed more like rallies than news conferences.  for all the celebration, however, the nation was also poised to reach 600,000 dead from the coronavirus, a grim reminder of the virus's painful toll even as americans begin to enjoy a summer with significantly fewer limitations, if any, on their ability to live, work and socialize.  more than 63,000 have died from the virus in california, while in new york that number has reached nearly 53,000 — the two highest totals in the country.  yet both governors took the opportunity to look ahead.  in a 45-minute speech, mr.  cuomo, who is facing multiple investigations and the possibility of an impeachment proceeding, highlighted many of his pet infrastructure projects, embraced political supporters and announced a display of fireworks statewide scheduled for tuesday night.  mr.  newsom, who is facing a recall campaign, but has seen his approval ratings improve as the pandemic has receded, showed up at universal studios hollywood flanked by an assortment of minions from the ""despicable me"" movie franchise and the ""transformers"" robot hero optimus prime to announce $1. 5 million lottery prizes to people who had been vaccinated.  in both states, health officials have struggled to expand vaccinations among significant pockets of their population.  some of the lowest adult vaccination rates in new york city, for example, are in the bronx, where 38 percent of adults are fully vaccinated and in brooklyn, where 41 percent are, while several populous counties in california have yet to hit a 40 percent full vaccination rate for all residents.  even so, the lifting of restrictions in the coastal states that were once epicenters of the pandemic marked a symbolic moment in the nation's fight against the coronavirus, and are expected to bring back the type of scenes familiar to most new yorkers and californians in prepandemic times. ""rollback of most of the remaining covid-19 restrictions is the green light that employers have been waiting for in order to bring employees back to the workplace,"" said kathryn wylde, the president of the partnership for new york city, an influential business group. in california, even business owners who had been critical of mr.  newsom expressed relief at the new rules.  ""i see light! i see light!"" joked michael helmrich, whose mandarin restaurant in sacramento was so battered during the past year that he posted a sign in the front window reading, ""newsom sucks — the life out of california small businesses. "" mr.  cuomo set the 70 percent threshold that triggered the end of the restrictions in new york last week as a way to spur on the state's reopening and incentivize people to get vaccinated, saying ""virtually all"" coronavirus rules would expire.  washington d. c.  and 13 other states besides new york and california have all reached the same threshold, according to the latest federal data, with vermont topping the list at 84 percent.  maryland will lift most virus restrictions on july 1, the state announced on tuesday.  president biden will host a 1,000 person gathering on july 4 on the south lawn of the white house to celebrate the country's continued return to normalcy.  mayor bill de blasio on tuesday announced that the city would hold a parade on july 7 to honor front line and essential workers.  california and new york residents should still expect to see some signs of pandemic life even with the restrictions lifted. both states will still abide by mask guidance from the centers for disease control and prevention, which has advised that unvaccinated people should wear masks indoors and maintain social distancing.  some stricter restrictions will remain in correctional and health care facilities, as well as in schools, public transit and homeless shelters. and the decision to end many of the precautions, such as allowing vaccinated customers to walk around without masks, will be up to individual businesses.  some may decide to keep them in place in order to allow their clientele and employees to feel safe. despite the cause for celebration, it will likely be months before new york city's commercial corridors in manhattan resemble anything like the hustle and bustle before the pandemic.  just 12 percent of workers have returned to their offices as of late may, about the same rate it was last fall, according to partnership for new york city. california has been in better shape economically than most states, although its tourism sector ""really had the sledgehammer taken to it,"" mr.  newsom noted on monday.  the state's unemployment rate remains about 4 percentage points higher than before the crisis and higher than the national average, largely because of layoffs at restaurants, hotels and tourist attractions.  over the past few months, as the virus positivity rate has reached record lows, mr.  cuomo has eased an array of pandemic-era rules, but tuesday's announcement was a near total cancellation of restrictions.  twenty-four-hour subway service resumed last month.  bars and restaurants were allowed to operate at 100 percent capacity and remain open past midnight.  state officials have also loosened capacity limits to allow more people in concert halls and sports stadiums. the governor was in a celebratory mood on tuesday, delivering a speech with upbeat music, as well as handshakes with major labor leaders, whom mr.  cuomo honored with plaques to recognize the sacrifice of essential workers during the pandemic.  mr.  cuomo did not take questions from reporters. ""remember june 15,"" mr.  cuomo said, noting that was also the birthday of his father, gov.  mario m.  cuomo, whom the younger cuomo often invokes.  ""it is the day that new york rose again. ""for a governor who climbed to national fame at the height of the pandemic, the speech appeared to suggest a ""mission accomplished"" moment in the state's battle against the virus at a time when mr.  cuomo has been embroiled in several scandals.  the governor has been scrambling to rehabilitate his image following sexual harassment accusations that have led to calls for his resignation, including among members of his own party.  multiple state and federal investigations are looking into the accusations, as well as his handling of nursing home death information and a $5. 1 million deal he received last year to write a pandemic memoir. mr.  newsom is facing a recall campaign.  the attempt to oust him — a democratic governor in a blue state who was elected in 2018 in a landslide — defied even the expectations of its republican backers by qualifying for the ballot.  speaking without a face covering at universal studios, mr.  newsom said it was time ""to move beyond capacity limits, to move beyond these color codings, move beyond social distancing and physical distancing, and — yes, as you saw me walk up to the stage — to move beyond mask coverings. "" ""today is a day to reconnect — to give people hugs, to remind them we're not out of the woods yet, to remind them we're all in this together,"" the governor said.  ""california is open again. ""still, some public health experts expressed concerns about a fuller reopening as the pace of vaccinations has slowed substantially in recent weeks, say that it was critical to increase the vaccination rate before the fall, when more people are indoors. ""my worry is whether this will erode the momentum of getting more people vaccinated,"" said dr.  wafaa el-sadr, a professor of epidemiology and medicine at columbia mailman school of public health.  ""i worry people are going to think this is behind us. ""others, however, said abandoning restrictions was merited, given the improving infection and hospitalization rates, but, most importantly, the number of people that have been vaccinated. dr.  kitaw demissie, the dean of the school of public health at suny downstate medical center in brooklyn, said that reaching a 70 percent vaccination rate represented a real public health success. ""seventy percent is really good in my opinion,"" he said, estimating that at least another 10 percent of people in new york city had immunity from prior infection.  ""so that will take us probably to 80 or 85 percent immunity.

2021-06-16,"PA's cancellation of planned meeting disappointing, says woman in Hari Raya wedding photo controversy, Singapore News.","singapore the woman at the centre of a controversy over the misuse of her wedding photograph for hari raya aidilfitri decorations has responded to the people's association's (pa) decision to cancel a planned meeting, saying it was a missed opportunity for constructive dialogue. in a statement on tuesday (june 15), communications specialist sarah bagharib, 30, said it was disappointing that the pa has decided to cancel the meeting with her and her husband that was meant to take place at 10am on tuesday. ""while there was an infringement of our privacy and intellectual property rights, our intentions have always been clear from the start to be active citizens and to positively contribute to making singapore a better, more inclusive home for our daughter,"" she said. she was referring to how her and her husband's wedding photo had been used by a vendor to create a standee alongside a decorative platform and banner depicting radin mas mp melvin yong and his hari raya aidilfitri greetings to residents at a housing board estate in radin mas constituency recently. this drew a public apology from the pa and an offer from the government agency to meet her and her husband, mr razif abdullah, to apologise in person for the distress caused by its mistakes. the pa had explained in an earlier statement that its radin mas constituency office had engaged a vendor, warabi enterprise (art studio), to design and put up hari raya aidilfitri decorations at the tiong bahru orchid estate. [[nid:530926]]after ms sarah drew attention to the matter, the pa removed the standee, and offered to meet the couple. however, the pa on monday announced that it had decided to cancel the meeting, citing disagreements with the couple over the purpose of the meeting and how they had characterised the incident. the pa noted that she had made a public call for messages and suggestions ahead of the meeting, and said it did not see why the meeting ""should be appropriated as a platform for (ms sarah) to funnel the views and comments of persons unrelated to the incident"". it had also said ms sarah had shared claims that the incident ""perpetuates the racist culture"" and was ""racist"", and rejected these claims. in her response to the pa's decision, ms sarah said that the incident did not just affect her and her husband through the ""culturally insensitive"" depiction of hari raya aidilfitri celebrations, but also the wider community that celebrates hari raya aidilfitri. ""we are all equal stakeholders in the work that the pa does.  we feel this is a missed opportunity for constructive dialogue; for thoughts and suggestions of members of the community to be relayed, and also for the people's association to listen to the people's voices.  it is unfortunate that the pa has turned this opportunity down,"" she said. ""we will continue to advocate for deeper intercultural understanding and greater social cohesion in our everyday lives as singaporeans,"" ms sarah added. on monday, the pa said it had wanted to clarify its position, elaborate on the steps it had taken to prevent such incidents from recurring, and hear her suggestions of how it might improve at the meeting. [embed]https://www. instagram. com/p/cqi44ohbnv3/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading[/embed]it also said it had, over e-mail, explained to ms sarah that it values racial and religious harmony in singapore. the pa also said that what happened in radin mas was an isolated incident, but nevertheless shows that it can fall short.

2021-06-16,Toa Payoh shock: Man who rescued electrocuted son feared the worst when he saw motionless body.,"nadine chuathe new paperjun 16, 2021it was his day off and he was resting at home, nursing a fever after getting his second covid-19 vaccine dose a day earlier. mr muhammad nazlan was watching tv with his wife on sunday night while their three children were out at the playground, located about 50m in front of his housing board unit. suddenly, his daughter, 10, burst into their first-storey flat, screaming and crying. mr muhammad, 34, a pest control technician, told the new paper yesterday: ""i could not hear what exactly she was saying.  all i knew was something bad had happened to my son. ""i rushed out with my wife and saw my son lying on the ground, his arm stuck to a lamp post.  my son was unconscious but his eyes were still open, and i thought he was gone. ""his eldest son, 14-year-old muhammad rifqy, was playing football with a friend when both teenagers got an electric shock from a lamp post near the fitness corner at block 63 lorong 5 toa payoh. the singapore civil defence force (scdf) said it received a call for assistance at 8. 25pm and two people were taken to kk women's and children's hospital. mr muhammad said his son was initially in the intensive care unit but was moved to a regular ward on monday afternoon.  he said rifqy's friend had been discharged. while his son is conscious, mr muhammad's friend, mr khairul anuar, 36, said rifqy is ""not his old self"" yet. ""i have been talking to him through video calls.  he is traumatised and his speech is slurred.  sometimes he talks using one word at a time.  but at least he is slowly recovering,"" said mr khairul, a grabfood rider. it could have been much worse, if not for mr muhammad's prompt action. rifqy had lost consciousness from an electric shock after he went to retrieve a ball that had rolled towards the lamp post. ""when i saw him lying there, i quickly tried to pull him away from the lamp post but his arm was stuck to it,"" said mr muhammad, who is asthmatic. ""that part of his arm looked like it was burned.  my heart felt like something sharp poked it, and i became breathless.  i also felt another two shocks, one in my hand and one in my leg, as i used my hand to pull him away. ""all i could think of was: if he dies, i also die with him. ""mr muhammad said his son seemed as if he had tensed up, and he felt helpless. ""i felt like a useless father because i wanted to give him cpr (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) but people around me were reminding me not to touch him,"" he said. the scdf arrived moments later to tend to his son and the friend. mr muhammad said his son told him the two had got to know each other three days prior to their sunday meeting, and the boy received a jolt when he touched rifqy. when tnp visited the scene yesterday afternoon, workers were completing the installation of four new lamp posts. mr muhammad, whose youngest is a five-year-old boy, said staff from bishan-toa payoh town council (btptc), which manages the estate, had contacted him and offered assistance. town council statementin a statement last night, the town council said it had completed checks to establish the probable cause of the electric shock. ""the btptc licensed electrical worker (lew) noticed a small tear to the insulation of the live wire inside the lamp post.  this would not be visible unless we remove the junction box. ""from the finding, the lew assessed that the exposed part of the wire touching the metal part of the lamp post could be the cause of the electric shock,"" said the town council. ""the lew has also checked other lamp posts within the same circuitry and found no similar situation.  the incident could be an isolated case as there was also no previous similar incident of such nature. ""the btptc added that works to rectify the issue were completed yesterday and it will ""continue to ensure the safety of (the) electrical installations (it manages)"". ""i have lived in this flat for 13 years.  my children have been playing at the playground since they were babies.  but now, even with new lamp posts installed, i am not sure if it is safe to let my kids play outside any more,"" said mr muhammad. ""all i can think of is if my son will recover fully.  i am worried because this is not just a fall or a fracture.  i don't know how he will be affected by this in the long run.

2021-06-16,"New York and California lift most Covid-19 curbs as they hit vaccination milestones, United States News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. new york (nytimes) the governors of new york and california, the states hit earliest and hardest by the covid-19 pandemic, triumphantly announced on tuesday (june 15) that they had lifted virtually all coronavirus restrictions on businesses and social gatherings as both states hit milestones in vaccinating their residents. in new york, where 70 per cent of adults have received at least one dose of the vaccine, the order from governor andrew cuomo means that restaurants will no longer be forced to space tables 6 feet (1. 8m) apart; movie theatres will be allowed to pack their auditoriums without spacing seats apart; and entrance to commercial buildings would not require a temperature check. ""this is a momentous day and we deserve it because it has been a long, long road,"" mr cuomo said on tuesday at the world trade centre, in lower manhattan, adding that the changes meant a ""return to life as we know it"". in california, where 72 per cent of adults have received at least one dose of the vaccine, govenor gavin newsom called on tuesday ""reopening day"", as he lifted similar capacity limits on businesses and social distancing requirements, with some exceptions. businesses in both states, however, will still have the option of requiring health precautions on their premises.  the two governors, both democrats who are facing political difficulties, made their announcements at events that seemed more like rallies than news conferences. for all the celebration, however, the nation was also poised to reach 600,000 dead from the coronavirus, a grim reminder of the virus's painful toll even as americans begin to enjoy a summer with significantly fewer limitations, if any, on their ability to live, work and socialise.  more than 63,000 have died from the virus in california, while in new york that number has reached nearly 53,000 – the two highest totals in the country. yet both governors took the opportunity to look ahead. in a 45-minute speech, mr cuomo, who is facing multiple investigations and the possibility of an impeachment proceeding, highlighted many of his pet infrastructure projects, embraced political supporters and announced a display of fireworks statewide scheduled for tuesday night. mr newsom, who is facing a recall campaign but has seen his approval ratings improve as the pandemic has receded, showed up at universal studios hollywood flanked by an assortment of minions from the ""despicable me"" movie franchise and the ""transformers"" robot hero, optimus prime, to announce us$1. 5 million (s$1. 9 million) lottery prizes to people who had been vaccinated. even with the restrictions lifted, california and new york residents should still expect to see some signs of pandemic life. both states will still abide by mask guidance from the centres for disease control and prevention, which has advised that unvaccinated people should wear masks indoors and maintain social distancing.  some stricter restrictions will remain in correctional and health care facilities, as well as in schools, public transit and homeless shelters. mr cuomo was in a celebratory mood on tuesday, delivering a speech with upbeat music, as well as handshakes with major labour leaders, whom mr cuomo honoured with plaques to recognise the sacrifice of essential workers during the pandemic.  he did not take questions from reporters. ""remember june 15,"" mr cuomo said, noting that was also the birthday of his father, govenor mario cuomo, whom the younger mr cuomo often invokes.  ""it is the day that new york rose again. ""new york mayor bill de blasio on tuesday announced that the city would hold a parade on july 7 to honour front line and essential workers. on independence day on july 4, president joe biden will host a 1,000-person gathering on the south lawn of the white house to celebrate the country's continued return to normalcy. some public health experts, however, have expressed concerns about a fuller reopening as the pace of vaccinations has slowed substantially in recent weeks, and they said it was critical to increase the vaccination rate before autumn, when more people are indoors. ""my worry is whether this will erode the momentum of getting more people vaccinated,"" said dr wafaa el-sadr, a professor of epidemiology and medicine at columbia mailman school of public health.  ""i worry people are going to think this is behind us. ""others, however, said abandoning restrictions was merited, given the improving infection and hospitalisation rate, and, most important, the number of people who have been vaccinated. dr kitaw demissie, dean of the school of public health at suny downstate medical centre in brooklyn, said reaching a 70 per cent vaccination rate represented a real public health success. ""seventy per cent is really good in my opinion,"" he said, estimating that at least another 10 per cent of people in new york city had immunity from prior infection.  ""so that will take us probably to 80 per cent or 85 per cent immunity.

2021-06-16,"Republicans introduce Bill to fire Fauci, face of US COVID-19 response.","washington: several republican lawmakers, eager to blame a us government official for the response to the covid-19 pandemic, introduced a bill on tuesday (jun 15) to fire anthony fauci, the face of american efforts to combat covid-19. congresswoman marjorie taylor greene led a handful of colleagues in announcing the so-called fire fauci act, which would reduce the famed infectious disease expert's government salary to zero and require the senate to confirm someone to fill his position. fauci, who has advised seven us presidents, had become a trusted figure in the government's covid-19 response, beginning with his work during donald trump's administration. but conservatives have taken aim at his performance, accusing him of misleading americans and providing contradictory advice on masks and social distancing. ""dr fauci was not elected by the american people.  he was not chosen to guide our economy.  he was not chosen to rule over parents and their children's education,"" greene told reporters. ""but yet dr fauci very much controlled our lives for the past year. ""the bill is not expected to receive a floor vote in the democratically-controlled house. greene, whose extremist statements have made her a controversial figure in congress, pointed to a series of fauci emails that republicans seized on to argue that he misled americans and initially dismissed the idea that covid-19 may have originated in a chinese laboratory. ""it's time to fire dr anthony fauci and give answers to the american people,"" she said. the white house defended fauci this month after the emails surfaced, calling him ""an undeniable asset"" in the pandemic response. greene also aimed a fiery accusation at china, voicing suspicion that a wuhan laboratory was seeking to weaponise the virus. ""why would there ever be viruses created, taken out of nature, that can be shared and passed among bats or other creatures, and then harnessed and changed into some sort of virus that can be spread among people? there's a word for that: it's called bioweapon,"" she said. ""were we all victims of a bioweapon? we demand answers. ""china also must be held accountable, she said, noting the wuhan institute of virology's ""gain-of-function"" research, in which scientists increase the strength of a virus to better study its effects on hosts. this week the chinese scientist at the center of theories that the pandemic originated with a leak from her specialised wuhan lab denied her institution was to blame for the health disaster.

2021-06-16,Chilly response: Former PAP MP gets a taste of winter after angry netizens flood his Instagram account with snowflake emoticon.,"former people's action party (pap) member of parliament (mp) amrin amin gets a taste of winter after netizens began flooding his instagram account with the snowflake emoticon under his most recent posts. a member of the public had earlier criticised the former parliamentary secretary for being ""out of touch"" when the latter opined on monday (14 june) that the people's association (pa)'s faux pas of using a malay couple's wedding photograph as a prop in its hari raya aidilfitri display at an hdb estate in tiong bahru is not a racist incident. mr amrin, however, responded by calling him a ""snowflake"", which drew a lot of flak from other netizens. in the comments section of mr amrin's post about the incident, one netizen replied that other individuals from minority communities do not have to agree with mr amrin's assessment of whether the incident is racist or not. ""no offense, but just cos you don't see it as racist don't mean the rest of us minorities have to agree with you.  stop being out of touch,"" the netizen wrote. the slew of snowflake emojis on mr amrin's instagram posts came after it was disclosed by several users that accounts posting comments mentioning the word ""snowflake"" have been blocked from mr amrin's page, following the exchange on monday. a contributor told wake up, singapore: ""he/his pr team is blocking anyone who comments the word 'snowflake' on his posts"". sharing a tiktok video he made to celebrate the dragon boat festival, mr amrin shared that he ""made 'bak chang' (meat rice) dumplings with family"". ""did you make any? i wish you and family peace and health this dragon boat festival.  !"" he added. a post shared by amrin amin (@amrinamin)users did not hesitate to poke fun at mr amrin's post, leaving comments with references to snowflakes, in addition to the numerous comments only containing snowflake emoticons. ""wishing you the same, snowflake,"" said one commenter. ""eh your dumplings got snowflake flavour or not ah,"" wrote another. ""can we have snowflake festival instead?"" one commenter joked. several commenters made references to elsa of arendelle, a fictional character from the disney film franchise ""frozen"" who is well-known for her superpower of creating and controlling ice and snow. ""elsa would be proud of this comment section,"" said one user.  two other most recent posts — one about covid-19 testing, the other about the easing of pandemic restrictions — were not spared from the cold as users proceeded to leave multiple comments with snowflake emoticons.  the word snowflake is derogatory slang for a person deemed to be very sensitive or easily offended.  according to the collin's dictionary definition, it means: ""someone deemed too emotionally vulnerable to cope with views that challenge their own, particularly in universities and other forums once known for robust debate. ""in his post on monday (14 june), mr amrin shared the pa's latest statement on the use of the wedding photo in its hari raya decorations at radin mas which caused an uproar two weeks ago when the woman whose photo was used called out the pa for its actions. following the incident, the pa issued a public apology, however ms sarah bagharib said that the apology shed light on ""glaring gaps"" that reflect a ""very superficial understanding of the gravity of the issue"". in response, the pa made a statement on its facebook page on monday referencing her interview with nanyang technological university professor walid jumblatt abdullah, from which she was quoted as saying that the incident has perpetuated a culture of racism. the pa said: ""these are accusations we reject.  while the error was culturally insensitive, it was certainly not racist.  it is not right to raise the allegation of racism, without basis, to stoke emotions and sentiments. ""the organisation claimed that it had explained to ms sarah that while it acknowledges that its staff ""should have been more culturally sensitive"", it is not right to paint ""sweeping conclusions from this incident"", adding that it was an ""isolated case"". the pa went on to describe ms sarah's public call for messages or suggestions that they would like to have relayed to the organisation in their meeting as ""odd"", adding that it does not see why that meeting should be ""appropriated"" as a platform for public grievances unrelated to the incident. as such, the pa said that it will not be following through with the meeting as there is ""no point"" in doing so, in light of the above. sharing the pa's statement on his own facebook page on the same day, mr amrin wrote that the lesson in this who situation is that while it is wrong to use a person's photo without permission and that weddings do no equate to hari raya, what the pa did was not ""racist"". ""as we call out racism, we must be careful not to label every error as borne out of racism or 'racist culture'. "" said the former mp of sembawang grc. he went on to say that while it is crucial to point out shortcomings, people should not be too hasty to ""cancel"" and always look out for ""opportunists eager to score points in their desire to gain mileage at any cost, without regard to sincere ongoing ground efforts"". he concluded, ""grace is important in building harmony in a diverse society.  no one is perfect.  it's a work-in-progress.  not every slip is armageddon. ""mr amrin's remarks, however, were largely met with indignation from netizens.  some expressed shock at his move to call ms sarah an ""opportunist"". many pointed out that mr amrin appears to be out of touch with his community and that they are glad he is no longer in office, as his views do not represent that of the people in the malay community.  © 2006 2021 the online citizen© 2006 2021 the

2021-06-16,China’s Campaign to Control Commodities Goes Into Overdrive.,"workers at a metal stock yard in shanghai on june 7.  the run up in commodities prices has fanned concerns in china that factories will eventually need to pass on higher costs to consumers, hurting the economy.  china has stepped up its campaign to rein in commodity prices and reduce speculation in a bid to ease the threat to its pandemic rebound from soaring raw material costs. state-owned enterprises were ordered to control risks and limit their exposure to overseas commodities markets by the state-owned assets supervision and administration commission, according to people with knowledge of the matter.  the companies have been asked to report their futures positions for sasac to review, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is confidential. in a second development, the national food and strategic reserves administration will soon release state stockpiles of metals including copper, aluminum and zinc, the agency said in a statement wednesday.  the metals will be sold in batches to fabricators and manufacturers, it said, without giving the volumes to be released. metals prices in london and shanghai fell, as did the singapore exchange's iron ore contract.  shares of metals companies in china and hong kong declined, while australia's metals and mining sub-index posted its biggest loss in almost a month.  european stocks fell too, with rio tinto plc, bhp group and arcelormittal sa losing at least 0. 8%. ""we haven't seen the country release state reserves for years,"" said jia zheng, a commodity trader with shanghai dongwu jiuying investment management co.  ""this will boost short-term supply, sending a bearish signal to the market. ""the scrutiny on overseas commodities positions, meanwhile, is aimed at ""curbing excessive speculation as prices are overheated and could bring risks to soes,"" said jia. the run up in commodities prices has fanned concerns in china that factories will eventually need to pass on higher costs to consumers, hurting the economy.  the role of speculators has drawn particular scrutiny from authorities. read more: china targets 'speculators and hoarders' to stop commodity boomwhile china has accelerated its efforts to curb inflationary pressures, the moves have had mixed results.  chinese premier li keqiang stepped up the rhetoric on may 12, urging the country to deal with soaring prices.  iron ore slumped in the latter part of may following his comments, though it's since rebounded, and base metals prices remain much higher than last year despite a recent retreat. goldman sachs group inc.  said last month the country's efforts are likely to be in vain as china is no longer the buyer dictating pricing, with the price dip a clear buying opportunity. read more: tracking china's campaign to rein in sky-high commodity priceschina doesn't publish information about the volumes it holds in its state reserves, but the government quietly sets aside commodities as a way of insulating from future price spikes.  the material can be released in emergencies, such as previous instances of selling pork to cool inflation concerns due to a shortage of the staple meat. this would be the first publicly announced release of copper from china's state stockpiles since 2005, when beijing sought to damp local prices after wrong-way bets by a government trader.  reserves of aluminum and zinc were also sold in 2010.  the lack of detail on volumes set to be released this time means it's uncertain how effective the move will be in taming prices. it's also unclear what could have triggered sasac's latest order on overseas positions.  the regulator hasn't ruled out further measures, including those that target specific companies under its control, the people said.  a fax to sasac seeking comment didn't receive a reply. the government had already asked domestic firms, including steel mills, commodities merchants and brokerages, to reduce bullish bets on local futures markets for highly volatile raw materials like iron ore and coal. the expansion of oversight suggests beijing is now seeking to exert a measure of control over the international benchmarks that influence commodities prices in china, as well as deterring speculation more generally among state-owned companies. — with assistance by jason rogers, winnie zhu, alfred cang, james thornhill, and james

2021-06-16,"DIY Covid-19 test kits now available at major pharmacies in Singapore, prices range from $10 to $13, Singapore News.","singapore sales of self-administered covid-19 test kits started at all major pharmacies in singapore on wednesday (june 16). all 79 guardian pharmacy stores islandwide have been stocked with two antigen rapid test (art) kits: the abbott panbiotm covid-19 antigen self-test and the quickvue at-home otc covid-19 test. a guardian spokesman said: ""both brands are approved by the health sciences authority (hsa).  the instructions on how to use these two brands differ, hence customers are advised to follow the specific instruction leaflet carefully for the brand they purchase. ""the same two test kits are also available at watsons singapore and unity stores. their retail prices range from $10 to $13 per test kit, as recommended by the ministry of health (moh). the abbott panbio test kit costs $13 at guardian.  the same kit costs $12. 80 at unity and $13. 10 at watsons.  it is cheaper to purchase the tests in boxes of 10 or more. there were few buyers for the test kits when the straits times checked guardian, watsons and unity pharmacy outlets in jurong east, bukit panjang, potong pasir and toa payoh on wednesday morning (june 16). retiree ms j.  brown, 60, visited a watsons pharmacy at bukit panjang plaza on wednesday to purchase covid-19 test kits for her family as they are returning to britain in september this year. ""instead of going all the way (to the test centre), it's easier and more convenient if you have the kits,"" said ms brown, whose husband works in the oil and gas industry and whose daughter works in a school.

2021-06-16,"Republicans introduce bill to fire Fauci, face of US Covid response.","several republican lawmakers, eager to blame a us government official for the response to the coronavirus pandemic, introduced a bill tuesday to fire anthony fauci, the face of american efforts to combat covid-19. congresswoman marjorie taylor greene led a handful of colleagues in announcing the so-called fire fauci act, which would reduce the famed infectious disease expert's government salary to zero and require the senate to confirm someone to fill his position. fauci, who has advised seven us presidents, had become a trusted figure in the government's covid-19 response, beginning with his work during donald trump's administration. but conservatives have taken aim at his performance, accusing him of misleading americans and providing contradictory advice on masks and social distancing. ""dr fauci was not elected by the american people.  he was not chosen to guide our economy.  he was not chosen to rule over parents and their children's education,"" greene told reporters. ""but yet dr fauci very much controlled our lives for the past year. ""the bill is not expected to receive a floor vote in the democratically-controlled house. greene, whose extremist statements have made her a controversial figure in congress, pointed to a series of fauci emails that republicans seized on to argue that he misled americans and initially dismissed the idea that covid-19 may have originated in a chinese laboratory. ""it's time to fire dr.  anthony fauci and give answers to the american people,"" she said. the white house defended fauci this month after the emails surfaced, calling him ""an undeniable asset"" in the pandemic response. greene also aimed a fiery accusation at china, voicing suspicion that a wuhan laboratory was seeking to weaponize the virus. ""why would there ever be viruses created, taken out of nature, that can be shared and passed among bats or other creatures, and then harnessed and changed into some sort of virus that can be spread among people? there's a word for that: it's called bioweapon,"" she said.

2021-06-16,"Former Supreme Court judge Goh Joon Seng dies, aged 86, Singapore News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore former supreme court judge goh joon seng, who had served on singapore's council of presidential advisers (cpa) for more than a decade, died of cancer on tuesday afternoon (june 15). he was 86, and is survived by his wife and two sons. born in china, mr goh was first admitted as a lawyer here in 1963, and his practice as senior partner at goh poh & partners consisted mainly of insurance and building cases.  he was appointed a supreme court judge in october 1990. he had read law at the then university of singapore.  he attended holy innocent's english school from 1948 to 1953 it was renamed montfort school in 1958. during his time on the bench, he built up a strong reputation for his decisions and mediation skills, and was well-liked by lawyers for his gentle and courteous manner. after retiring as a judge, mr goh became a consultant to law firm lee and lee and also continued to serve the public in various capacities. for instance, he was tasked with chairing the three-member commission of inquiry set up to investigate the escape of jemaah islamiah terrorist mas selamat kastari from the whitley road detention centre in 2008. he had also played an instrumental role as the founding chairman of numerous mediation bodies here, including the singapore mediation centre (smc), the singapore chamber of maritime arbitration (scma) as well as the former consumer mediation unit (cmu), which handled customer complaints that banks are unable to resolve on their own. described by former chief justice chan sek keong as an ""approachable, friendly and unassuming judge who is mr affability himself"", mr goh was appointed the chairman of the smc when it was launched in 1997 to resolve disputes through mediation.  he played a key role in overseeing the growth and development of mediation services in singapore until he stepped down from the position in 2003. justice belinda ang saw ean, who is smc's chair, said singapore owes a lot of its reputation as a centre for mediation to mr goh. ""what was once a little-known form of dispute resolution has become established thanks to his guidance and stewardship. . .  those who knew him will remember that he was a gentleman through and through. ""he was also founding chairman of the financial industry disputes resolution centre (fidrec) from 2005 to 2017, which was set up to sort out disputes between consumers and institutions and incorporates the cmu and the insurance disputes resolution organisation (idro). during his time at fidrec, mr goh oversaw the resolution of complaints related to investments that unravelled after united states investment bank lehman brothers went belly up in 2008. he was also a member of the council of presidential advisers from 2008 to april this year, and had chaired the presidential council for religious harmony from 2005 to 2017. for his contributions, he was awarded the public service star in the 2006 national day awards, as well as the meritorious service medal in 2016. president halimah yacob on tuesday said mr goh made many valuable contributions as a member of the cpa.  ""he was meticulous and known for his attention to details, and was often counted upon to provide the legal perspective to the issues at hand,"" she said. she added that mr goh's tenure in the cpa also coincided with a period when singapore's reserves protection framework was put to the test, first during the global financial crisis in 2008 and then most recently during the covid-19 pandemic. ""on both occasions, mr goh and the cpa provided wise counsel on the proposals to draw upon our past reserves to manage the crises. ""chief justice sundaresh menon also said on tuesday that mr goh was a greatly respected judge who was admired and liked in equal measure by those who served with him and those who appeared before him. ""this was a time of much change in the profession, and many at the bar will remember it as a challenging period.  joon seng did his part in implementing the many reforms of the time, but always with kindness, and he came to be known to many of us as the gentle face of justice. ""in a statement, home affairs and law minister k.  shanmugam said that mr goh was a very committed volunteer with the volunteer special constabulary (vsc), where he served for 23 years, including two years as its commander.  the vsc was formed immediately after world war ii, in 1946, to assist regular police officers. ""he was a wonderful person, and had great judicial temperament.  it was always a pleasure to appear in his court.  he was very kind to counsel, was patient, had a keen sense of right and wrong. . .  his passing is a considerable loss for singapore,"" said mr shanmugam. minister for culture, community and youth and second minister for law edwin tong said that mr goh had left a lasting impression on him when he was a young lawyer and appeared before him in several of his early cases. ""i learnt a lot from him, from always being on top of each case, the way he reasoned the cases before him to the empathy he showed to the accused persons and their families.  he was someone with a strong head and a generous heart, and mixed them both to find the balance of justice,"" said mr tong. he added that mr goh also struck him as someone who always had singapore's interests at heart.  when their paths crossed after he took office at the ministry of law, and when mr goh was scma chairman, mr goh also discussed several key questions with him, including how jobs can be created for singaporeans, and how singapore can be positioned as a maritime and dispute resolution hub. senior judge chao hick tin, chairman of scma, said mr goh had played an instrumental role in scma's growth as its founding chairman from 2009 to 2019. ""it is because of his outstanding leadership, dedication, and contributions that scma has made remarkable progress since its inception in 2009,"" said justice chao. the montfort school and montfort alumni association added that mr goh actively participated in alumni activities and supported school fund-raisers, and even lent his legal skills to writing the alumni's constitution. holland-bukit timah grc mp christopher de souza, a partner at lee and lee, said mr goh was a role model to many lawyers in the firm. ""mr goh had a brilliant legal mind and a kind countenance. . .  he would freely share his deep knowledge and insights into legal cases whenever we approached him.  his values of diligence and stewardship will remain with the firm, and its lawyers, for a long time.  we deeply mourn his passing.

""we will never tolerate attempts to seek independence or wanton intervention in the taiwan issue by foreign forces, so we need to make a strong response to these acts of collusion,"" ma said. democratically-ruled taiwan has complained over the last few months of repeated missions by china's air force near the island, concentrated in the southwestern part of its air defence zone near the taiwan-controlled pratas islands. however, this time not only did the chinese aircraft fly in an area close to the pratas islands, but the bombers and some of the fighters flew around the southern part of taiwan near the bottom tip of the island, according to taiwan's defence ministry. the fly-by happened on the same day the us navy said a carrier group had entered the disputed south china sea. a senior official familiar with taiwan's security planning told reuters that officials believed china was sending a message to the united states as the carrier group sailed through the bashi channel, which separates taiwan from the philippines and leads into the south china sea. ""it's strategic intimidation of the us military.  they wanted the united states to notice their capability and for them to restrain their behaviour.

""our pursuit of defence and military modernisation is justified, reasonable, open and transparent,"" china's mission to the european union said in a statement. it added that nato should view china's development in a ""rational manner"" and ""stop taking china's legitimate interests and rights as an excuse to manipulate bloc politics, create confrontation and fuel geopolitical competition"". china's rebuttal came on the same day that it flew 28 air force jets into taiwan's air defence zone, the island's government said.  it is the fifth incursion this month, and the largest to date. biden says america is back at the tablenato: us and europe are safer standing togetherwhat does the us do for nato?nato's statement came at the end of a one-day summit in brussels on monday. it marked joe biden's first nato meeting as us president. the powerful political and military alliance between 30 european and north american countries sees russia as a main threat.  mr biden is due to meet russian president vladimir putin in geneva on wednesday. according to the summit's communiqué (concluding statement), china's ""stated ambitions and assertive behaviour present systemic challenges to the rules-based international order and to areas relevant to alliance security"".

""but, he added: ""we need to address together, as the alliance, the challenges that the rise of china poses to our security"". china is one of the world's leading military and economic powers, whose ruling communist party has a tight grip on politics, daily life and much of society. the chinese military currently has the largest armed forces in the world, with over two million personnel on active duty. nato has become increasingly concerned about the growing military capabilities of china, which it sees as a threat to the security and democratic values of its members. in recent years, the alliance has also grown wary of china's activities in africa, where it has set up army bases. the north atlantic treaty organisation, known as nato, is the world's most powerful regional defence allianceit was set up in 1949, after world war two, to counter the threat of communist expansionit was founded on the principle of collective defence between alliesit originally had 12 members, but now has 30 made up of european countries and the us and canadanato's current missions include offering training and assistance to afghan security forces, maintaining a peacekeeping force in kosovo and supporting counter-terrorism work in iraqas well as military operations, nato has supported relief efforts after crises like hurricane katrinaread more about natouk prime minister boris johnson said: ""when it comes to china, i don't think anybody around the table wants to descend into a new cold war with china.

2021-06-16,Malaysian court to rule on challenge by French-Irish teen's family.,"nora quoirin, a teenager who went missing from a malaysian rainforest resort since 4 aug 2019 (source: afp / quoirin family)a malaysian court will rule wednesday on a challenge by the family of a french-irish teenager over an inquest verdict that she died by misadventure after vanishing in the jungle. the body of nora quoirin, a 15-year-old with learning difficulties, was discovered after a huge hunt through the rainforest following her disappearance from a resort outside kuala lumpur in 2019. in january, a coroner handed down a ruling of misadventure, indicating her death during the family holiday was accidental rather than a crime, and said no one else was involved. but her london-based parents, who have dismissed authorities' claims their daughter wandered into the jungle alone at night, and believe she was abducted, said they were ""utterly disappointed"" by the verdict. they lodged a challenge and are seeking to have the ruling revised to an open verdict — suggesting there are still questions to be answered about the case. judge azizul azmi adnan is expected to hand down his ruling at 5:00 pm (0900 gmt) at the high court in seremban, outside kuala lumpur, via video-link because of coronavirus curbs. presenting the family's case at a hearing last week, lawyer louise azmi said an open verdict would be ""appropriate"". ""the last thing that (nora) would do is to walk away from the security of her parents,"" she said. malaysian police have stuck to their version of events — that the teenager clambered out of a window of the family's holiday chalet and wandered off, and insist there was no sign of foul play. but her mother, meabh, has said she believes someone could have placed her body in the spot where it was found, not far from the resort. the teenager disappeared a day after her family checked in to the dusun resort, triggering a 10-day hunt involving hundreds of rescuers, helicopters and sniffer dogs. an autopsy concluded she likely died of starvation and internal bleeding. the coroner said the teenager had been left disoriented by the long journey from britain to malaysia, likely leading her to wander off, and that there was no sign she was murdered or sexually assaulted. the teen had a condition known as holoprosencephaly, where the brain fails to develop normally.  she had limited verbal communication and could only write a few words. — afp © 2006 2021 the online citizen© 2006 2021 the online

															afp tokyo: japan could allow up to 10,000 fans at sports events ahead of the olympics, media reported wednesday, as organisers weigh how many domestic fans can attend the games. the measure, intended to come into force after a coronavirus state of emergency ends on june 20, will be discussed by the government's virus taskforce on wednesday, the nikkei business daily and kyodo news agency said. the plan would limit spectators to 50% of a venue's capacity or 10,000 people, whichever is lower. it could set the boundaries for a decision by olympic organisers on how many domestic fans, if any, can attend games events.  overseas spectators have already been banned. the olympic decision is expected only after the virus emergency in tokyo ends on june 20 and the government clarifies what measures will replace it. recent reports have said the government could introduce ""quasi-emergency"" measures including restrictions on the sale of alcohol or limited opening hours for bars and restaurants. experts and officials have expressed concerns that huge crowds attending the games could accelerate virus infections after the emergency ends. japan has so far seen a comparatively small virus outbreak, with slightly more than 14,000 deaths despite avoiding harsh lockdowns. but its vaccination programme has moved slower than many other developed nations, with just over five percent of the population fully inoculated so far. under the current state of emergency, spectators are capped at 5,000 people or 50 percent of a venue's capacity, whichever is smaller. the decision on olympic fans is expected by the end of the month. khon kaen: a farmer was electrocuted while putting up an electric fence to protect seedlings in his rice field on tuesday night, and his son was also killed when he rushed to help him, police said. chickens, cows, paid leave, even a million-dollar apartment, these are the prizes on offer from thailand to indonesia to hong kong for those who get vaccinated against covid-19 as nations across asia combat vaccine hesitancy. the fight against covid-19 is focusing on poor enforcement of prevention measures at factories, where the virus is spreading ""relentlessly"".

2021-06-16,"MAS reprimands 4 financial institutions, 2 people for breaching risk management, remuneration rules.","singapore: the monetary authority of singapore (mas) has reprimanded four financial institutions for breaching rules related to risk management practices and sales-related remuneration under the financial advisers act, the regulator said on tuesday (jun 15). the four institutions are: aia financial advisers (aia fa), prudential assurance company singapore, aviva and aviva financial advisers (aviva fa). mas also reprimanded two individuals – mr peter tan shou yi, a consultant engaged by aviva, and aviva fa's chief executive and director lionel chee boon chai – in relation to the matter. mas' deputy managing director for financial supervision ho hern shin said the regulator has ""dealt firmly"" with these financial institutions and individuals ""to send a clear message to the industry on the importance of upholding high ethical standards"". what rules were breachedin a media release, mas said that during the course of its ongoing supervision, there were indications that these financial institutions may have breached regulatory requirements on remuneration practices. in response to queries, the regulator told cna that these indications were whistle-blowing complaints, as well as findings from its onsite inspections and offsite supervision. it then conducted an investigation and found ""numerous instances"" where remuneration was paid to supervisors – a person responsible, both directly or indirectly, for the supervision or management of a financial adviser – in contravention of requirements under the financial advisers act. one is the balanced scorecard requirements (bsc) for the sale of investment products. under this, the variable income of supervisors and representatives are determined by the fulfilment of non-sales key performance indicators, such as understanding a client's needs and suitability of product recommendations.  grades are given to the supervisors and representatives every quarter. another is the spreading and capping of commissions (scc) requirements that apply to the sale of regular premium life policies. insurers and financial adviser firms are required to cap the variable income payable to representatives and supervisors to 55 per cent in the first year, and spread the remaining variable income payable over a ""prescribed period"". both requirements were introduced as part of the financial advisory industry review in 2015. the financial institutions and individuals had also breached the financial advisers regulations and guidelines on risk management practices, which require financial institutions to put in place appropriate policies to ensure compliance with regulations. these various breaches took place between 2016 and 2019. what happened at avivamas said aviva engaged mr peter tan shou yi as a consultant from july 2016 to march 2020 to provide strategic advice on aviva fa's business. but mr tan ""went beyond providing strategic advice and acted as a supervisor"" to representatives at aviva fa during this period by having frequent and direct interactions with these representatives, including discussions on sales and compliance issues. from july 2016 to april 2019, neither aviva nor aviva fa put in place compliance arrangements to monitor mr tan's activities in aviva fa. mas said for failing to put in place these arrangements, aviva and aviva fa had contravened the guidelines on risk management practices – internal controls and the financial advisers regulations, respectively. ""mr tan had acted as a supervisor of aviva fa by virtue of his roles and responsibilities in the firm, but aviva fa failed to review and assess mr tan's performance, assign a bsc grade to him, and determine and pay his remuneration in accordance with the bsc,"" the regulator said. ""aviva also failed to cap and spread his variable income in accordance with the scc.  in accepting such remuneration, mr tan also breached the scc. ""aviva fa's chief executive and director, mr chee, was also reprimanded for failing to ""discharge the duties of his office"", said mas. apart from failing to ensure that proper arrangements were in place to monitor mr tan's activities, he did not properly address the issue of the poor conduct of aviva fa's representatives which included misrepresentations to customers regarding the nature and features of certain insurance products. mas said despite its repeated supervisory engagements with aviva fa between august 2017 and september 2018 over the sales conduct of its representatives, the measures put in place ""remained inadequate"". it therefore directed aviva fa to appoint independent external persons to conduct a ""holistic review"" of the company's internal control processes, and to perform call-backs to all customers before any sales are completed.  these measures remain in place. it also required aviva fa to investigate, take disciplinary actions against the representatives concerned and provide remediation for the affected customers, according to further information provided by an mas spokesperson. aviva fa has done so, the spokesperson added, noting that the regulator will take ""appropriate regulatory actions"" if breaches of mas' regulations are established. what happened at aia faaia fa did not review and assess the performance of three of its managing directors who had acted as supervisors, said mas. it also failed to assign bsc grades and pay remunerations in accordance with the bsc, as well as cap and spread the variable income of these managing directors according to the scc. what happened at prudentialin prudential's case, the company had appointed three individuals referred to as ""master group agency manager"" leaders and a consultant to act as supervisors. but it failed to review and assess the performance of these leaders and consultant, assign bsc grades to them, as well as determine and pay their remuneration in accordance with the requirements. prudential also failed to put in place adequate risk mitigation procedures and compliance arrangements to monitor the activities of this group of leaders and consultant. no direct harm to customers: masa reprimand is a formal regulatory action under the financial advisers act and registers ""serious concerns"" from the mas regarding a misconduct. those issued with reprimands are required to remediate the issues ""promptly"". asked why the mas chose to issue reprimands in this case, the spokesperson said: ""in deciding on the appropriate enforcement action for a case, mas considers all the relevant circumstances, including the seriousness of the misconduct, the impact of the misconduct on customers or the financial sector, and any remediation actions taken. ""the financial regulator said that there was no evidence of ""direct harm to customers"" as a result of the breaches by the four financial institutions. ""nevertheless, the failures are viewed seriously because the bsc and scc requirements are intended to align the interests of financial advisory firms, supervisors and representatives with those of their customers, and promote a culture of fair dealing,"" the emailed response said. ""non-compliance with the requirements therefore increases the risk that customers' interests could be prejudiced. ""in response to cna's queries, aviva singapore said the lapses identified by mas occurred prior to its merger with a consortium led by singapore life, which was completed in november last year. ""following the transaction, the newly constituted board has invested significant time and resources to address the underlying issues.  we have strengthened our controls to prevent the recurrence of such issues, and these are being validated by an independent external auditor,"" the spokesperson said. leadership changes were also done ""to strengthen management effectiveness and accelerate culture change"", the emailed response said. prudential singapore said it would ""work closely"" with mas to further enhance its controls in relation to the bsc requirements and accompanying risk management measures with the view of resolving the issues raised. aia fa told cna that it had cooperated fully with mas during the course of investigations and would continue to work closely with the regulator for the remediation actions required. it added that it was fully committed to protecting the interests of its customers and that no customers were affected by this matter. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

said on tuesday (jun 15).', 'the four institutions are: aia financial advisers (aia fa), prudential assurance company singapore, aviva and aviva financial advisers (aviva fa).', ""mas also reprimanded two individuals – mr peter tan shou yi, a consultant engaged by aviva, and aviva fa's chief executive and director lionel chee boon chai – in relation to the matter."", 'mas\' deputy managing director for financial supervision ho hern shin said the regulator has ""dealt firmly"" with these financial institutions and individuals ""to send a clear message to the industry on the importance of upholding high ethical standards"".', 'what rules were breachedin a media release, mas said that during the course of its ongoing supervision, there were indications that these financial institutions may have breached regulatory requirements on remuneration practices.', 'in response to queries, the regulator told cna that these indications were whistle-blowing complaints, as well as findings from its onsite inspections and offsite supervision.', 'it then conducted an investigation and found ""numerous instances"" where remuneration was paid to supervisors – a person responsible, both directly or indirectly, for the supervision or management of a financial adviser – in contravention of requirements under the financial advisers act.', 'one is the balanced scorecard requirements (bsc) for the sale of investment products.', ""under this, the variable income of supervisors and representatives are determined by the fulfilment of non-sales key performance indicators, such as understanding a client's needs and suitability of product recommendations."", 'grades are given to the supervisors and representatives every quarter.', 'another is the spreading and capping of commissions (scc) requirements that apply to the sale of regular premium life policies.', 'insurers and financial adviser firms are required to cap the variable income payable to representatives and supervisors to 55 per cent in the first year, and spread the remaining variable income payable over a ""prescribed period"".', 'both requirements were introduced as part of the financial advisory industry review in 2015. the financial institutions and individuals had also breached the financial advisers regulations and guidelines on risk management practices, which require financial institutions to put in place appropriate policies to ensure compliance with regulations.', ""these various breaches took place between 2016 and 2019. what happened at avivamas said aviva engaged mr peter tan shou yi as a consultant from july 2016 to march 2020 to provide strategic advice on aviva fa's business."", 'but mr tan ""went beyond providing strategic advice and acted as a supervisor"" to representatives at aviva fa during this period by having frequent and direct interactions with these representatives, including discussions on sales and compliance issues.', ""from july 2016 to april 2019, neither aviva nor aviva fa put in place compliance arrangements to monitor mr tan's activities in aviva fa."", 'mas said for failing to put in place these arrangements, aviva and aviva fa had contravened the guidelines on risk management practices – internal controls and the financial advisers regulations, respectively.', '""mr tan had acted as a supervisor of aviva fa by virtue of his roles and responsibilities in the firm, but aviva fa failed to review and assess mr tan\'s performance, assign a bsc grade to him, and determine and pay his remuneration in accordance with the bsc,"" the regulator said.', '""aviva also failed to cap and spread his variable income in accordance with the scc.', 'in accepting such remuneration, mr tan also breached the scc.', '""aviva fa\'s chief executive and director, mr chee, was also reprimanded for failing to ""discharge the duties of his office"", said mas.', ""apart from failing to ensure that proper arrangements were in place to monitor mr tan's activities, he did not properly address the issue of the poor conduct of aviva fa's representatives which included misrepresentations to customers regarding the nature and features of certain insurance products."", 'mas said despite its repeated supervisory engagements with aviva fa between august 2017 and september 2018 over the sales conduct of its representatives, the measures put in place ""remained inadequate"".', 'it therefore directed aviva fa to appoint independent external persons to conduct a ""holistic review"" of the company\'s internal control processes, and to perform call-backs to all customers before any sales are completed.', 'these measures remain in place.', 'it also required aviva fa to investigate, take disciplinary actions against the representatives concerned and provide remediation for the affected customers, according to further information provided by an mas spokesperson.', 'aviva fa has done so, the spokesperson added, noting that the regulator will take ""appropriate regulatory actions"" if breaches of mas\' regulations are established.', 'what happened at aia faaia fa did not review and assess the performance of three of its managing directors who had acted as supervisors, said mas.', 'it also failed to assign bsc grades and pay remunerations in accordance with the bsc, as well as cap and spread the variable income of these managing directors according to the scc.', 'what happened at prudentialin prudential\'s case, the company had appointed three individuals referred to as ""master group agency manager"" leaders and a consultant to act as supervisors.', 'but it failed to review and assess the performance of these leaders and consultant, assign bsc grades to them, as well as determine and pay their remuneration in accordance with the requirements.', 'prudential also failed to put in place adequate risk mitigation procedures and compliance arrangements to monitor the activities of this group of leaders and consultant.', 'no direct harm to customers: masa reprimand is a formal regulatory action under the financial advisers act and registers ""serious concerns"" from the mas regarding a misconduct.', 'those issued with reprimands are required to remediate the issues ""promptly"".', 'asked why the mas chose to issue reprimands in this case, the spokesperson said: ""in deciding on the appropriate enforcement action for a case, mas considers all the relevant circumstances, including the seriousness of the misconduct, the impact of the misconduct on customers or the financial sector, and any remediation actions taken.', '""the financial regulator said that there was no evidence of ""direct harm to customers"" as a result of the breaches by the four financial institutions.', '""nevertheless, the failures are viewed seriously because the bsc and scc requirements are intended to align the interests of financial advisory firms, supervisors and representatives with those of their customers, and promote a culture of fair dealing,"" the emailed response said.', '""non-compliance with the requirements therefore increases the risk that customers\' interests could be prejudiced.', '""in response to cna\'s queries, aviva singapore said the lapses identified by mas occurred prior to its merger with a consortium led by singapore life, which was completed in november last year.', '""following the transaction, the newly constituted board has invested significant time and resources to address the underlying issues.', 'we have strengthened our controls to prevent the recurrence of such issues, and these are being validated by an independent external auditor,"" the spokesperson said.', 'leadership changes were also done ""to strengthen management effectiveness and accelerate culture change"", the emailed response said.', 'prudential singapore said it would ""work closely"" with mas to further enhance its controls in relation to the bsc requirements and accompanying risk management measures with the view of resolving the issues raised.', 'aia fa told cna that it had cooperated fully with mas during the course of investigations and would continue to

""but the bionix did not stop and the accident happened,"" recounted ong as he struggled to keep his composure in court. he had told the court on monday that his actions in overtaking a vehicle without establishing communication with it first was ""not unsafe"".

if the practice of notifying a vehicle before overtaking it was ""important and safe"", it would have been included in the training safety regulations, he had said. ong also said he had instructed cfc liu to overtake a bionix the day before the incident. the trial continues on wednesday. if convicted, ong can be jailed for up to five years, fined, or both. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-16,"Lianhe Zaobao replies to open letter over its editorial on race, Singapore News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore chinese daily lianhe zaobao has responded to an open letter signed by local academics and scholars who took issue with its recent editorial on race relations, saying it has consistently upheld racial equality and advocated for mutual understanding among all ethnic groups in singapore. as the anchor chinese newspaper, it has publicly and unequivocally condemned several recent local incidents of racial discrimination, and jointly defended racial harmony through its editorials, zaobao said on monday (june 14). ""singapore is a multiracial nation.  we truly believe in the ideals expressed in the national pledge and cherish the hard-won racial harmony, but that does not mean that we believe that there are no tensions in racial relationships,"" it said. ""lianhe zaobao has always taken a consistent stance on upholding equality among all races and advocating that there should be mutual understanding among ethnic groups.  this is evident from our editorials, news reports and feature articles.  in the midst of the pandemic, we have seen more racial tensions simmering, which is why we have published a total of seven editorials related to this issue in the past year and a half. ""the open letter, which was signed by over 200 people, was concerned about the way it felt zaobao had characterised the problem of racism here in the wake of recent racial incidents in its june 9 editorial titled 'expanding public space to promote racial harmony'. the letter's signatories include phd students, researchers and academics, among them professors linda lim, lee soo ann, vineeta sinha and pang eng fong. the letter said the editorial ""ignores the dynamics of structural racism and the longer history of racial stereotyping in singapore"", and blamed the recent incidents on the uncertainty caused by the pandemic, the sensationalism of social media, and the import of ""foreign ideas"" such as critical race theory the idea that racism is not just about personal prejudice but is also embedded and perpetuated by systems and policies. ""it is true that feelings of uncertainty heighten inter-group tensions, and that conversations on social media can be polarising.  however, the editorial uses these arguments to suggest that recent racist incidents are an anomaly in an otherwise racially harmonious society, and that social media exaggerates what are otherwise exceptional acts by unusually racist individuals,"" said the letter. it said the pandemic and social media have ""simply revealed long-standing fissures and the everyday discrimination experienced by racial minorities in singapore"". the letter also said zaobao had misrepresented critical race theory as ""promoting hatred of white people"" in the united states, and by extension, of chinese people here.  it added that this argument is typically made by far-right commentators in the us who do not engage in the actual writings and concepts of critical race theory. in response, zaobao hoped readers would see the june 9 editorial in its entirety, saying the piece analyses the problem from three different aspects, and tries to explain that the pandemic, the role of social media, and popular ideological trends from abroad have all exacerbated racial tensions. critical race theory (crt) was cited as an example of the influence of foreign ideas, zaobao said, adding some scholars had used the concept, which originated in the us in the 1970s, to analyse race issues here, and criticise it for downplaying the ""systemic and structural racism"" in singapore. it also noted the different interpretations of the concept in academic circles, saying: ""one should not easily dismiss the critique of crt by serious scholars as a 'far-right american perspective'. """"we strongly believe that when discussing the issue of race in singapore, we should not be applying foreign ideas and concepts without adapting them to local conditions,"" zaobao added. it said racial discrimination exists in every society, with some things in common and others specific to each.  ""theories and concepts based on foreign situations may not always be applicable to singapore.  sometimes, instead of deepening our understanding of the issue and promoting consensus, they may complicate it.  but we are also aware and accept that there are those who do not agree with such views and positions. ""it added: ""racial harmony is a common goal for all singaporeans.  we believe the scholars who signed the letter share the same philosophy and welcome rational and open discussion on the issue.

condemned several recent local incidents of racial discrimination, and jointly defended racial harmony through its editorials, zaobao said on monday (june 14).', '""singapore is a multiracial nation.', 'we truly believe in the ideals expressed in the national pledge and cherish the hard-won racial harmony, but that does not mean that we believe that there are no tensions in racial relationships,"" it said.', '""lianhe zaobao has always taken a consistent stance on upholding equality among all races and advocating that there should be mutual understanding among ethnic groups.', 'this is evident from our editorials, news reports and feature articles.', 'in the midst of the pandemic, we have seen more racial tensions simmering, which is why we have published a total of seven editorials related to this issue in the past year and a half.', '""the open letter, which was signed by over 200 people, was concerned about the way it felt zaobao had characterised the problem of racism here in the wake of recent racial incidents in its june 9 editorial titled \'expanding public space to promote racial harmony\'.', ""the letter's signatories include phd students, researchers and academics, among them professors linda lim, lee soo ann, vineeta sinha and pang eng fong."", 'the letter said the editorial ""ignores the dynamics of structural racism and the longer history of racial stereotyping in singapore"", and blamed the recent incidents on the uncertainty caused by the pandemic, the sensationalism of social media, and the import of ""foreign ideas"" such as critical race theory the idea that racism is not just about personal prejudice but is also embedded and perpetuated by systems and policies.', '""it is true that feelings of uncertainty heighten inter-group tensions, and that conversations on social media can be polarising.', 'however, the editorial uses these arguments to suggest that recent racist incidents are an anomaly in an otherwise racially harmonious society, and that social media exaggerates what are otherwise exceptional acts by unusually racist individuals,"" said the letter.', 'it said the pandemic and social media have ""simply revealed long-standing fissures and the everyday discrimination experienced by racial minorities in singapore"".', 'the letter also said zaobao had misrepresented critical race theory as ""promoting hatred of white people"" in the united states, and by extension, of chinese people here.', 'it added that this argument is typically made by far-right commentators in the us who do not engage in the actual writings and concepts of critical race theory.', 'in response, zaobao hoped readers would see the june 9 editorial in its entirety, saying the piece analyses the problem from three different aspects, and tries to explain that the pandemic, the role of social media, and popular ideological trends from abroad have all exacerbated racial tensions.', 'critical race theory (crt) was cited as an example of the influence of foreign ideas, zaobao said, adding some scholars had used the concept, which originated in the us in the 1970s, to analyse race issues here, and criticise it for downplaying the ""systemic and structural racism"" in singapore.', 'it also noted the different interpretations of the concept in academic circles, saying: ""one should not easily dismiss the critique of crt by serious scholars as a \'far-right american perspective\'.', '""""we strongly believe that when discussing the issue of race in singapore, we should not be applying foreign ideas and concepts without adapting them to local conditions,"" zaobao added.', 'it said racial discrimination exists in every society, with some things in common and others specific to each.', '""theories and concepts based on foreign situations may not always be applicable to singapore.', 'sometimes, instead of deepening our understanding of the issue and promoting consensus, they may complicate it.', 'but we are also aware and accept that there are those who do not agree with such views and positions.', '""it added: ""racial harmony is a common goal for all singaporeans.', 'we believe the scholars who signed

2021-06-16,"Dickson Yeo, man who spied for China, to remain behind bars.","singapore — dickson yeo, the singaporean man who was jailed in the us for spying for china and was arrested by the internal security department (isd) upon his return to singapore last year will be continue to be held in detention under the internal security act. in a statement on tuesday (15 june), the department said its investigations have established that yeo ""worked for the intelligence apparatus of a foreign state and had carried out various taskings given to him by his foreign handlers in exchange for monetary gains"". from 2016 until his arrest in the us in 2019, yeo was asked to source for information and provide reports on issues, including information relating to singapore, and had approached various people in singapore to try to get information for his reports, said the isd. he also set up a front company in singapore as a cover, not only for information-gathering activities but also for his foreign handlers to recruit others. ""he had also tried, but failed, to secure employment in the singapore government sector to further his information-gathering activities,"" the department added. the isd said its investigations are still ongoing and yeo's continued detention is necessary ""to facilitate probes into the full extent of his activities"". ""the singapore government takes a very serious view of anyone who enters into a clandestine relationship with a foreign government and engages in activities at the behest of the foreign power that is inimical to our national security and interests, including bilateral relations,"" the department added. yeo was a doctoral candidate at the national university of singapore's lee kuan yew school of public policy (lkyspp) when he was recruited by chinese intelligence officers after a 2015 trip to beijing to give a presentation on the political situation in southeast asia. he was first arrested by american counterintelligence officers in november 2019.  he pleaded guilty in july last year to one charge of operating illegally as a foreign agent, and admitted to working between 2015 and 2019 for chinese intelligence ""to spot and assess americans with access to valuable non-public information, including us military and government employees with high-level security clearances"". a few days after he entered his plea, lkyspp said it had terminated yeo's phd candidature with immediate effect.  yeo had enrolled as a phd student there in 2015 and was granted a leave of absence in 2019. in october last year, yeo was jailed for 14 months in the us for passing to the chinese government valuable, but unclassified, military and political information that he had duped a number of americans into giving him.  prosecutors said that yeo was motivated by monetary gain and a shared desire with china to weaken the global standing of the us.  among the information yeo handed over to china were reports on a military aircraft program, us troop withdrawal in afghanistan and on a us cabinet member, who was not identified in court documents. ""i take full responsibility for what i have done,"" yeo reportedly said during sentencing.  ""i am sympathetic to china's position, but it was not my intention to harm anyone. ""in a statement announcing his arrest upon his return to singapore in december last year, singapore's ministry of home affairs said, ""singapore will not allow our nationals to be subverted or used by any foreign actors for activities prejudicial to our security and national interests.

2021-06-16,'Justice never sleeps': Families of Philippine drug war victims welcome ICC probe.,"by neil jerome morales and karen lemamanila (reuters) philippine president rodrigo duterte will not cooperate with an investigation into the country's bloody war on drugs planned by the international criminal court (icc), his spokesperson said on tuesday, while families of the victims cheered the move. normita lopez, whose son was a victim of the anti-drugs campaign, said she could not contain her happiness when she learned about the icc prosecutor's request to open a full investigation into the killings. ""i am happy because i realised that justice never sleeps,"" said lopez, 56, who is among the many complainants to the icc calling for duterte's international indictment over thousands of alleged extra-judicial killings. ""god is not sleeping, he always finds a way,"" she said.  her 23-year-old son was killed in may 2017 for allegedly resisting arrest during a sting operation. in what human rights groups described as a landmark step towards justice, the icc prosecutor asked the court on monday to allow a full investigation into the killings in the brutal war on drugs, which duterte unleashed when he took office in 2016. since then, philippine security forces say they have killed 6,117 suspected drug dealers because they fought back violently, but rights groups say authorities have summarily executed drug suspects. duterte, who in march 2018 cancelled the philippines' membership of the icc's founding treaty, will not cooperate with the probe, his spokesperson said, while rejecting the icc prosecutor's findings. ""we will not cooperate because we are no longer a member,"" spokesperson harry roque told a news conference on tuesday. under the icc's statute, it has jurisdiction for crimes committed while a country was a member until a year after it sought to withdraw, in this case between 2016 and 2019, when the philippines' pullout became official. icc chief prosecutor fatou bensouda said on monday that she had concluded a preliminary examination into the killings and had sought permission from the court for a full inquiry. she had said last december there were reasonable grounds to believe crimes against humanity had been committed during duterte's bloody anti-narcotics crackdown, whose death toll has stirred international outrage. a series of reuters stories in 2016 and 2017 exposed the brutal killings being carried out in the philippines as part of the war on drugs.  many of these stories were referred to in the icc report on its preliminary examination. 2016 series: https://www. reuters. com/investigates/section/philippines-duterte2017 series: https://www. reuters. com/investigates/section/philippines-drugspopular at homedespite concerns from the international community about the crackdown on drugs, duterte remains popular at home and many filipinos back his tough stance on crime. his single six-year term as president will end in june next year, and political analysts say he would want an ally to win the presidency to protect him from potential legal challenges and political vendettas once he loses immunity out of office. ""we do not need foreigners to investigate killings in the drug war because the legal system is working in the philippines,"" roque said, adding he believed launching a formal probe was ""legally erroneous and politically motivated. ""roque said police used appropriate force and there was ""no intention to target and kill civilians. ""a government anti-drugs agency said in a statement that cases filed against erring officers were being dealt with and denied there were ""policies that permit, tolerate, and condone killings and other human rights violations. ""but randy delos santos, uncle of high school student kian delos santos who was killed by police officers in august 2017, said he refused to believe government claims that the victims had fought back.  he said he hoped reports on his nephew's death, which form part of the icc report, will pave the way for other families of drug war victims to secure justice. ((see the reuters report on the 17-year-old's killing here https://www. reuters. com/article/us-philippines-drugs-student-iduskcn1b51u2))""i welcome the icc (prosecutor's move).  there are many who died (in the drugs war).  i feel the pain of other families,"" delos santos told reuters.

2021-06-16,"Man who rescued electrocuted son feared the worst when he saw the boy's motionless body, Latest Singapore News.","it was his day off and he was resting at home, nursing a fever after getting his second covid-19 vaccine dose a day earlier. mr muhammad nazlan was watching tv with his wife on sunday night while their three children were out at the playground, located about 50m in front of his housing board unit. suddenly, his daughter, 10, burst into their first-storey flat, screaming and crying. mr muhammad, 34, a pest control technician, told the new paper yesterday: ""i could not hear what exactly she was saying.  all i knew was something bad had happened to my son. ""i rushed out with my wife and saw my son lying on the ground, his arm stuck to a lamp post.  my son was unconscious but his eyes were still open, and i thought he was gone. ""his eldest son, 14-year-old muhammad rifqy, was playing football with a friend when both teenagers got an electric shock from a lamp post near the fitness corner at block 63 lorong 5 toa payoh. the singapore civil defence force (scdf) said it received a call for assistance at 8. 25pm and two people were taken to kk women's and children's hospital. mr muhammad said his son was initially in the intensive care unit but was moved to a regular ward on monday afternoon.  he said rifqy's friend had been discharged. while his son is conscious, mr muhammad's friend, mr khairul anuar, 36, said rifqy is ""not his old self"" yet. ""i have been talking to him through video calls.  he is traumatised and his speech is slurred.  sometimes he talks using one word at a time.  but at least he is slowly recovering,"" said mr khairul, a grabfood rider. it could have been much worse, if not for mr muhammad's prompt action. rifqy had lost consciousness from an electric shock after he went to retrieve a ball that had rolled towards the lamp post. ""when i saw him lying there, i quickly tried to pull him away from the lamp post but his arm was stuck to it,"" said mr muhammad, who is asthmatic. ""that part of his arm looked like it was burned.  my heart felt like something sharp poked it, and i became breathless.  i also felt another two shocks, one in my hand and one in my leg, as i used my hand to pull him away. ""all i could think of was: if he dies, i also die with him. ""mr muhammad said his son seemed as if he had tensed up, and he felt helpless. ""i felt like a useless father because i wanted to give him cpr (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) but people around me were reminding me not to touch him,"" he said. the scdf arrived moments later to tend to his son and the friend. mr muhammad said his son told him the two had got to know each other three days prior to their sunday meeting, and the boy received a jolt when he touched rifqy. when tnp visited the scene yesterday afternoon, workers were completing the installation of four new lamp posts. mr muhammad, whose youngest is a five-year-old boy, said staff from bishan-toa payoh town council (btptc), which manages the estate, had contacted him and offered assistance. in a statement last night, the town council said it had completed checks to establish the probable cause of the electric shock. ""the btptc licensed electrical worker (lew) noticed a small tear to the insulation of the live wire inside the lamp post.  this would not be visible unless we remove the junction box. ""from the finding, the lew assessed that the exposed part of the wire touching the metal part of the lamp post could be the cause of the electric shock,"" said the town council. ""the lew has also checked other lamp posts within the same circuitry and found no similar situation.  the incident could be an isolated case as there was also no previous similar incident of such nature. ""the btptc added that works to rectify the issue were completed yesterday and it will ""continue to ensure the safety of (the) electrical installations (it manages)"". ""i have lived in this flat for 13 years.  my children have been playing at the playground since they were babies.  but now, even with new lamp posts installed, i am not sure if it is safe to let my kids play outside any more,"" said mr muhammad. ""all i can think of is if my son will recover fully.  i am worried because this is not just a fall or a fracture.  i don't know how he will be affected by this in the long run.

""did you target civilians? did you kill them willingly, knowing they were civilians? obviously, the answer is no,"" he said. that being the case, he argued, the ""extrajudicial killings"" that resulted from the drug war could not be considered ""crimes against humanity"". in one of her last acts before stepping down as chief prosecutor of the international criminal court (icc) this week, ms fatou bensouda sought a full investigation into mr duterte's purported crimes against humanity for a drug war that has left thousands dead since he took office in 2016. ""i have determined that there is a reasonable basis to believe that the crime against humanity of murder has been committed. . .  in the context of the government of philippines 'war on drugs' campaign,"" she said in a statement. in her 57-page report to icc's judges, ms bensouda said ""there is a reasonable basis to believe"" that security forces and state-sanctioned ""vigilantes"" killed between 12,000 and 30,000 drug suspects from july 1, 2016, to march 16, 2019. she said security officials ""paid police officers and vigilantes bounties"" to execute people suspected of being involved in the drug trade. ""state officials at the highest levels of government also spoke publicly and repeatedly in support of extrajudicial killings and created a culture of impunity for those who committed them,"" she said. she said the investigation should include allegations of torture and other ""inhumane acts"" dating back as far as 2011, when mr duterte was mayor of davao city. human rights activists called ms bensouda's decision a step closer to holding mr duterte accountable. it is a ""much-awaited step in putting murderous incitement by president duterte and his administration to an end"", amnesty international's secretary-general, ms agnes callamard, said. ""the icc's intervention must end this cycle of impunity in the country and send a signal to the police and those with links to the police who continue to carry out or sanction these killings that they cannot escape being held accountable for the crimes they commit,"" she said. the international coalition for human rights in the philippines said it was ""a positive step that may help bring some measure of justice to the thousands victimised and terrorised by the duterte regime"". it called on the united nations human rights council to begin its own probe into mr duterte's human rights record. mr duterte was elected to office in 2016 on a campaign promise to get rid of the country's drug problem, openly exhorting the police to kill drug suspects. but he has repeatedly denied links to the killings, insisting that most resulted from rivalries among drug gangs. he has also backed police accounts that most of those killed were on ""drug watch lists"" who had been armed and resisted arrest. while ms bensouda concluded that as many as 30,000 had been killed, the latest official data showed just 6,000 suspects had died in over 200,000 anti-drug operations. the philippines officially withdrew from the icc in 2019 on mr duterte's order after multiple complaints were filed against him. ms bensouda, however, said previous cases showed that ""the court retains jurisdiction over crimes that are alleged to have occurred on the territory of that state during the period when it was a state party"" to the icc. but mr roque insisted that the icc lacked jurisdiction in the philippines. ""we are no longer a member of the icc,"" he said. he added that the court could not intervene as long as the philippines had ""independent and competent courts"" that were already investigating the killings. ""the icc will not exercise jurisdiction unless the state is unable and unwilling to prosecute. . .  this is not the case in the philippines,"" he said. should the court decide to probe him for war crimes, mr duterte would ""never cooperate"" as long as he is president, mr roque added. he said the icc should also not allow itself to be used by mr duterte's political enemies harbouring ambitions for higher office. he said among those who filed complaints before the icc was former senator antonio trillanes, a former soldier and fierce critic of mr duterte, who has announced his intention to run for president next year. the icc's judges have up to four months to issue a decision on ms bensouda's request.  but pursuing it would be up to ms bensouda's successor, mr karim khan, who would be sworn in on wednesday (june 16). in a statement, the philippines' foreign ministry said ms bensouda's ""midnight announcement"" tied mr khan's hands. the ministry said ms bensouda had ""undercut the attractiveness"" of joining the icc for some nations. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

was not a ""widespread systematic attack against civilians"".', '""did you target civilians?', 'did you kill them willingly, knowing they were civilians?', 'obviously, the answer is no,"" he said.', 'that being the case, he argued, the ""extrajudicial killings"" that resulted from the drug war could not be considered ""crimes against humanity"".', ""in one of her last acts before stepping down as chief prosecutor of the international criminal court (icc) this week, ms fatou bensouda sought a full investigation into mr duterte's purported crimes against humanity for a drug war that has left thousands dead since he took office in 2016."", '""i have determined that there is a reasonable basis to believe that the crime against humanity of murder has been committed.', '.', '.', 'in the context of the government of philippines \'war on drugs\' campaign,"" she said in a statement.', 'in her 57-page report to icc\'s judges, ms bensouda said ""there is a reasonable basis to believe"" that security forces and state-sanctioned ""vigilantes"" killed between 12,000 and 30,000 drug suspects from july 1, 2016, to march 16, 2019. she said security officials ""paid police officers and vigilantes bounties"" to execute people suspected of being involved in the drug trade.', '""state officials at the highest levels of government also spoke publicly and repeatedly in support of

""mr duterte was elected to office in 2016 on a campaign promise to get rid of the country's drug problem, openly exhorting the police to kill drug suspects."", 'but he has repeatedly denied links to the killings, insisting that most resulted from rivalries among drug gangs.', 'he has also backed police accounts that most of those killed were on ""drug watch lists"" who had been armed and resisted

2021-06-16,Chinese scientist at center of virus controversy denies lab leak theory.,"chinese virologist shi zhengli photographed inside a laboratory at the wuhan institute of virology in wuhan, china in 2017 (source: afp)the chinese scientist at the center of theories that the coronavirus pandemic originated with a leak from her specialized lab in the city of wuhan has denied her institution was to blame for the health disaster. ""how on earth can i offer up evidence for something where there is no evidence?"" dr shi zhengli told the new york times in rare comments to the media. ""i don't know how the world has come to this, constantly pouring filth on an innocent scientist,"" she told the us daily. us president joe biden last month ordered intelligence agencies to investigate the origin of the pandemic, including the lab leak theory. the leak hypothesis had been floated earlier during the global outbreak, including by biden's predecessor donald trump, but was widely dismissed as a conspiracy theory. but it has gained increasing traction recently, fueled by reports that three researchers from the wuhan institute of virology became sick in 2019 after visiting a bat cave in the southwestern chinese province of yunnan. shi is an expert in bat coronaviruses, and some scientists have said she could have been leading so-called ""gain-of-function"" experiments in which scientists increase the strength of a virus to better study its effects on hosts. according to the new york times, in 2017 shi and her colleagues at the wuhan laboratory published a report on an experiment ""in which they created new hybrid bat coronaviruses by mixing and matching parts of several existing ones — including at least one that was nearly transmissible to humans — in order to study their ability to infect and replicate in human cells. ""but in an email to the paper, shi said her experiments differed from gain-of-function experiments since they did not seek to make a virus more dangerous.  instead they were trying to understand how the virus might jump across species.

2021-06-16,Joe Biden should be wary when meeting Vladimir Putin.,"do not expect much to come from the first face-to-face meeting between the two leadersfind your bookmarks in your independent premium section, under my profilefind your bookmarks in your independent premium section, under my profilebiden says us not seeking 'conflict' with russiawith the first summit between joe biden and vladimir putin now upon us in geneva, one should look on this encounter in a different light from the old meetings during the cold war. the soviet union of the time acted as a great power organised according to certain ideological dogmas and trying to impose the order it praised onto the rest of the world.  the west comprising of the united states and western europe actually practiced the same attitude, but one based on values rather than by an ideology. today's russia is not a leading power similar to the soviet union.  it's only significant asset is the nuclear arsenal it inherited from the ussr.  economically it is just outside the top 10 nations by gdp and pushes the religious and ethnic values of the ""russian world"" socially it's looking backwards, celebrating unique russian morality, ""traditional values"" and glorifying its past over outlining the contours of its future.  there is an argument that it has actually been one of the greater losers of globalisation. in his early years of putin's time in power, he expressed certain sympathy towards the european union – such as in his 2001 bundestag speech: ""as for european integration, we not just support these processes, but we are looking to them with hope"". but as it became clear to putin that neither europe nor the west in general had no enthusiasm for recognising russia as their equal partner, moscow's position changed – and it spent time swinging between putin's harsh talks in munich and bucharest in 2007 and 2008 and former president dmitry medvedev's ""reset"" from 2009 to 2011. the russian actions over ukraine in 2014, i would argue, was the first expression of a new strategy – the bones of which can be seen in an academic report entitled ""new rules or no rules?"" the authors assume that the old order was maybe not very attractive, but stable and enduring – and that it contained the blueprint for ""rules"" to follow.  the major ""rule"" was, by some coincidence, the power of force, second, this old world was managed through blocs and alliances, with those in charge of these things responsible for the ""order"" within them.  third, the idea of sovereignty was considered a universal one, and the sovereign's rights were not subjected to any international laws (governing either the inter-state relations or the internal systems of governance).  what was illegal under such conditions, cannot be considered as ""justified""the ""rules"" then exist only where there's order, and order is established once and for a long time (if not forever).  if the ""order"" is constantly disrupted or changed, it can-not be regarded as such – and if there's no order, then nobody needs to play by the ""rules"".  so it was that ""post-crimean"" russia emerged not as a country that wants to propose its own ""rules"", but as one that has no trust in ""rules"" imposed by others. i believe that for putin, today's world represents chaos – it cannot be anything else because it is changing.  presidents change, crises appear, and new ethical and judicial norms arise.  these developments are incompatible with the very idea of order – so they make any kind of ""rules"" useless.  therefore, today's world is a scene on which only a 'game without rules' can be played.  the world is now managed in an unordered way so any nation has a right to respond, disobeying the old ""rules"" and either establishing their own, or acting arbitrarily. the russian seizure of crimea was an important milestone here: the kremlin organised a referendum after it annexed the territory that was used as a legitimisation of crimea's transfer from ukraine to russia.  for russia to act this way was a ""new rule' – and the west was left free to consider whether it was a breach of international law. the kremlin doesn't establish its own rules in russia's domestic policy – it remains extremely unpredictable – but it denounces any of those that have been recognized by the greater part of international community. this ""game with no rules"" is putin's dream as he can rationalise any action. everything moscow – or russia-connected individuals – have been accused of in recent years that shocked the western world – from poisoning individuals in the streets of british cities, to develop-ing extensive ""fake news' farms"" and securing the assad regime in syria was ""natural"" from the point of view of this doctrine. the kremlin, i believe, realises that it's too weak to pretend to be a part of the community that creates the rules of the contemporary world, but it has proved that it's powerful enough to defy them – and among the ""rules"" it defies is the rule requiring the statesman to be clear and honest in his dealings. i would doubt that putin feels guilty about his actions, because he became a strong believer in the idea that there is no order in the entire world, so anything is possible.  for example, if you may jail local opposition activists, why should you refrain from it?i believe today's russia isn't a ""soviet union 2. 0"" – it is a power guided by a set of ideas completely different from those governing the western world.  for putin, only in an ""orderly"" world – i. e.  one that allows sovereign states to establish spheres of interest without any concern of international conventions – can moscow be asked to act in an ""orderly"" way.  and so, russia acts as if the ""rules"" don't exist. this very fact makes dealings with putin extremely difficult – and it's what president biden should be prepared for.  the upcoming meeting in geneva is symbolic, the kremlin's spokesperson has already said the russian leadership do not expect any breakthroughs from it. in geneva – and in any other place where the western-russian ""dialogue"" may take place during putin's time in power – one will witness an encounter of two different worlds, rather than of two nations that want to try and work together on one single world.  the west isn't looking in a mirror when it comes to russia – it is confronted by an entirely different beast altogether. vladislav l.  inozemtsev is a special advisor to memri's russian media studies projectjoin thought-provoking

jcvi expected to make recommendation against the move until scientists have more data on the risks
ministers will be advised against the mass rollout of covid vaccinations to children until scientists obtain more data on the risks, the telegraph understands. experts on the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation (jcvi) are expected to make a recommendation against the vaccination of under-18s in the immediate future. the committee is understood to be preparing an ""interim"" statement for release as soon as the end of the week following a meeting on tuesday.   at a meeting, members are understood to have voiced serious ethical concerns about vaccinating children, given that they rarely suffer serious illness from covid. the statement is set to say more time is needed to assess studies of vaccine rollouts in other countries where children are being vaccinated – including the us and israel – before deciding whether such a programme should be launched in the uk. a whitehall source said: ""nobody is going to green light the mass vaccination of children at this stage.  ""scientists want to see more data from the us and elsewhere before taking a firm stand either way.  nobody is going to make a final decision at this point.  the jcvi will want to weigh up the benefits against the risks before vaccinating children, and it wants more data. ""the advice may disappoint ministers, who have instructed officials to be ready to roll out vaccines for children this summer in order to suppress covid and help keep schools open.  ministers have said britain has bought enough of the pfizer vaccine to offer jabs to all children aged between the ages of 12 and 17. teaching unions have also called for the vaccination of children, and on monday prof chris whitty, the chief medical officer, suggested they may need to be vaccinated to ensure that their education can continue without disruption. asked whether covid jabs would be rolled out to children, prof whitty told a downing street news conference that the ""wider question"" was about whether this would help limit the disruption the virus was causing to their schooling. boris johnson also suggested the decision to keep restrictions in place until july 19 was partly timed to coincide with the start of the school holidays, as the spread of the virus among young people will reduce. in the us, the centers for disease control and prevention recommended that all children aged over 12 should get a covid vaccination in may.  israel – which achieved the fastest rollout to adults globally – has just begun vaccinating those aged 12 to 15. both countries have been able to largely relax covid rules, which will increase pressure on the uk government to follow suit in vaccinating children. the pfizer vaccine has been deemed safe for those aged 12-15 by the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (mhra), so ministers could ignore the jcvi's advice. a senior government source said: ""the pfizer vaccine has been licensed for 12 to 15-year-olds by the mhra, and a number of countries will be vaccinating children in those age groups.  ministers have not received advice, and no decisions have been taken. ""on tuesday, france opened up vaccinations to children aged 12 and over in a bid to ward off a rise in infections as it lifts restrictions. the uk has the highest take-up of vaccines globally, with 30 million people – including almost all over 50s – now double-jabbed.  later this week the programme will open up bookings to everyone over 18. however, there is concern from some scientists that the high transmissibility of the indian or delta covid variant means the spread of the virus cannot be checked without a still wider rollout of vaccinations. but in recent days, the jcvi's deputy chairman has expressed increasing concern about a shift to vaccination of children. prof anthony harden told bbc radio 4's today programme: ""we do have to be absolutely sure these vaccines are completely safe.  the mhra said they are safe in trials, but of course that's very different to immunising millions of children.   ""we'll be looking very carefully at the data emerging from the states and other countries on vaccines in children before making any assumptions, but we're not there yet with children. ""previously, prof harden had said the benefit to children's health was ""pretty marginal"" because most get very mild illness, but the case for jabbing them in order to secure their education could be considered.  on tuesday, he declined to comment. separately, it emerged on tuesday night that ministers are set to announce that covid jabs will become mandatory for care home workers. we rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism. we urge you to turn off your ad blocker for the telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future. thank you for your support. need help?visit our adblocking instructions

""digital sex crimes have become so common, and so feared, in south korea that they are affecting the quality of life of all women and girls,"" heather barr, the report's author, said in a statement. ""women and girls told us they avoided using public toilets and felt anxious about hidden cameras in public and even in their homes.  an alarming number of survivors of digital sex crimes said they had considered suicide. ""the report, based on 38 interviews and an online survey, said sex crime prosecutions involving illegal filming rose 11-fold between 2008 and 2017, according to data from the korean institute of criminology. south korean president moon jae-in has called for police to investigate the growing number of sexual abuse claims, including recently among members of the military. last year, police broke up an online network that lured dozens of women and underage girls into what authorities have called ""virtual enslavement"" by blackmailing them into sending increasingly degrading and sometimes violent sexual imagery of themselves. hrw said the government needs to do more by increasing legal penalties for convicted offenders, boosting the number of women among the police, prosecutors, and judges, and changing broader gender inequality that normalises the consumption of non-consensual images. in 2019, prosecutors dropped 43. 5 per cent of digital sex crime cases compared to 27. 7 per cent of homicide cases and 19 per cent of robbery cases, though the sex crime cases that were prosecuted usually ended in a conviction, the report said. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

""but these cases, if indeed caused by the vaccine, will be much fewer compared with covid-19-induced heart inflammation ones. ""it is also important to note that the occurrence of some rare events is natural for any vaccine, especially when large numbers have been vaccinated, he stressed. ""no other vaccine has come under the scrutiny as covid-19 vaccines.  in about six months, over 1. 5 billion people have been vaccinated under close observation,"" he added. he said it is unclear why young men may be more susceptible, and that it is difficult to conduct the necessary studies to determine a correlation. ""nonetheless, we can expect more detailed description of what happens to these cases in the coming months, from those that have been treated in the us and israel.  the picture may become clearer then.

""going forward, we must combine vaccination with increased testing and rapid isolation of potential infection clusters to keep our schools open and safe,"" he said. he added that students' well-being and undisrupted learning will remain a priority for moe, which will continue to monitor the situation closely and make adjustments.  get the st smart parenting newsletter for expert advice.  visit the microsite for more. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

(1:35)the opening day of the 2021-22 premier league season will see manchester city begin their title defence away at tottenham hotspur on aug.  14, the league announced on wednesday. pep guardiola's city will have to face spurs, arsenal, leicester, chelsea and liverpool in their first seven games of the season. the complete guide to the 2021-22 premier league season
- ogden: city, chelsea given horror start but does it matter? runners-up manchester united begin their season at old trafford against rivals leeds united followed by a more favourable run against southampton, wolverhampton wanderers, newcastle, west ham united, aston villa and everton. following a poor defence of their 2019-20 premier league title, liverpool's season starts with a trip to norwich.  they will face both chelsea and city at anfield in their opening seven games. liverpool's toughest run, however, comes during the christmas period with three away games at spurs, leicester and chelsea as well as a game against leeds at anfield on dec.  26. champions league winners chelsea play crystal palace at home on aug.  14 followed by a london derby with arsenal.  alongside their early fixture with liverpool, they also face spurs away in the first six games. chelsea's participation in the club world cup means they will have to rearrange games in december, with fixtures for the competition in japan yet to be released. arsenal -- who finished eighth -- must play liverpool, city and north london rivals spurs in the first month-and-a-half of the league. no premier league matches will take place on the weekend of jan.  29 as part of the fifa international match calendar. the opening game between city and spurs could have added significance should the latter's talisman harry kane make a move to manchester this summer. espn reported in may that kane had told spurs he wants to leave the club and city are one of the leaders to secure the england international's signature. the 2019-20 season was disrupted by the covid-19 pandemic which forced a halt to the competition for 100 days and the following season saw fans kept out of stadiums for much of it. the attempt of six clubs to join the breakaway european super league in april saw fans protest both outside and inside stadiums, with united fans breaking into old trafford to express their unhappiness with the club's owners. on the pitch, guardiola's side ran away with the title, wrapping up the league on may 11, finishing 12 points clear of rivals united. while city also won the carabao cup, they lost 1-0 to chelsea in the champions league final and leicester city walked away with the fa cup.

clearing some mythsaccording to the latest reports, children with a mild infection can be treated in home isolation, recommending symptomatic treatment with paracetamol.  however, if the symptoms are life-threatening and continue to progress, it is crucial to seek medical help. if you believe covid isn't impacting kids mentally and emotionally, then it is untrue.  while unlike adults, children may lack the ability to express, they also bear the psychological ills of the pandemic.  during such unpredictable times, where not only are children getting affected by the virus, many have lost one or both their parents to covid-19.  this has surely taken a grievous toll on children's psychology. the health experts have said, ""it is imperative to recognise as a society that in our well-meaning attempt to protect our young ones from disease and keep them physically safe, we do not inadvertently impair their minds by curtailing access to expression for their inherent curiosity, creativity, and joy.

2021-06-16,South Korea failing to tackle widespread digital sex crimes: HRW.,"a hidden-camera search squad, consisting of student and citizen volunteers, scan a restroom near a public pool in changwon, south korea on 25 jul 2018 (source: getty images)south korean authorities are failing to properly tackle the country's widespread digital sex crimes against women, which have a devastating impact on victims, a human rights watch (hrw) report said wednesday. south korea is the world's 12th largest economy and a leading technological power, but remains a male-dominated society with a poor record on women's rights. digital sex crimes, or the sharing of intimate pictures or video without permission, are a massive problem in the country, where ""molka"" or spycam videos secretly filmed in public places are common, as is ""revenge porn"" — private sex videos filmed or shared non-consensually by disgruntled exes. south korean officials ""in the criminal legal system –- most of whom are men –- often seem to simply not understand, or not accept, that these are very serious crimes,"" said hrw's heather barr, the report author. in 2019, almost 45 percent of sexual digital crime cases were dropped by the country's prosecution, compared with 19 percent of robbery cases and 27. 7 percent of homicides, the report said. even when there were convictions, it found almost 80 percent of perpetrators received just ""a suspended sentence, a fine, or a combination of the two"" last year. ""digital sex crimes have become so common, and so feared. . .  they are affecting the quality of life of all women and girls,"" barr said. spycams have become so prevalent that female police officers now regularly inspect public toilets, with women telling hrw they avoided using the amenities altogether. one woman who spoke to barr was given a clock by a male employer, which she put in her bedroom — only later finding out the device had been streaming footage to him for over a month. victims often feel deep shame and are socially ostracised, and an ""alarming number"" told hrw they had contemplated suicide. the report comes as an anti-feminist backlash grows in south korea, with companies accused of endorsing ""radical feminism"" being boycotted by some men. barr said ""widely accepted harmful views"" about women and girls were the root cause of the phenomenon. the government has ""not sent a clear and forceful message that women and men are equal,"" she said. — afp © 2006

2021-06-16,A humpback whale swallowed Michael Packàrd as was lobster diving in Cape Cod.,"josiah mayo surveyed the ocean's surface on friday, watching the bubbles that emerged from his fishing partner's underwater breathing gear.  it was michael packard's second plunge into the ocean off the coast of cape cod that morning and he had already caught about 100 pounds of lobster. but the bubbles suddenly stopped.  then, an explosion of white water erupted from the sea. mayo wasn't sure what he was witnessing.  a burly fish thrashed before him and for a split second he thought it was a great white shark.  then mayo saw its flukes cut through the water and observed it violently shake its head. ""this was a humpback whale,"" mayo, 43, told himself, as he recounted in an interview with the washington post.  ""it was a relief because it wasn't a shark, which meant michael would be all done at that point. ""moments later there was another mighty boil of white water and packard soared out of the ocean and flopped back down.  mayo sped the boat up next to packard, who was floating in a puffed-out drysuit thanks to the whale's speedy ascent to the surface. ""i was inside it.  i was inside its mouth,"" packard, 56, told mayo.  ""it tried to eat me. ""packard's harrowing tale is rare and unheard of among the experienced divers of provincetown, mass.  humpback whales don't harm people on purpose, said mayo, who worked on whale-watching boats as a teenager and whose father is a premier whale scientist. mayo said his father and his colleagues believe the only logical explanation was that the whale swallowed packard by accident. ""it took [packard] from behind and it seemed like it fully enveloped him immediately,"" mayo said.  ""that's kind of remarkable and so we can only imagine the whale was probably feeding. ""mayo added he believed it was a young whale. ""i like to think of it as a teenager or a puppy.  . . .  it probably doesn't know what it's doing too well,"" he said. a similar incident occurred off the coast of port elizabeth, south africa, in 2019 when a bryde's whale scooped up a marine conservationist documenting a mass migration.  experts who witnessed the event also said it was an accident, noting the whales are ""gentle giants,"" one said in a short documentary. diving is a dangerous occupation and packard, a provincetown native who has been commercial diving since he was 18, has come close to death more times than most, mayo said. while lobster diving in 2017, packard came across the body of a fellow diver who was lost at sea six years earlier.  packard has gotten lost a few times himself, mayo said, thanks to a strong current that carried him far from the boat.  mayo, fortunately, found him each time. packard spent years diving for abalone in the shark-filled waters off the coast of central california, mayo said.  he's gotten concussions, injured his hand a few times and had two close encounters with great white sharks in cape cod. ""clearly they weren't interested in eating him because they would have, since they could have,"" mayo said. packard also nearly died in 2001 when he was in a plane crash in costa rica and suffered life-threatening injuries.  three people died and at least four others survived. on friday around 5:30 a. m. , mayo and packard set off into calm water in their fishing vessel, named the ""ja'n j"" after packard's 12- and 16-year-old sons.  the two have worked together for about 15 years and often fish for lobster, bluefin tuna and mackerel. packard's first dive that morning ""wasn't great,"" mayo said, requiring his partner to go back in a few more times. at about 8 a. m. , packard plunged about 45 feet deep, and almost reached the ocean floor when he ""felt this truck hit me and everything just went dark,"" he said in an interview with wbts. ""and i could feel just . . .  hard stuff all around me,"" packard said.  ""and i just thought, 'did i just get eaten by a white shark?' and then i said, 'no, i don't feel any teeth. ' and i said, 'oh my god, i'm in the mouth of a whale.  with his mouth shut. ' ""packard felt the whale swimming and shoved his breathing regulator back into his mouth. ""i'm like, 'this is how you're gonna go, michael.  this is how you're going to die.  in the mouth of a whale,' "" he recalled thinking. for about 30 to 40 seconds, packard twisted, turned and coped with an agonizing pressure on his legs.  he could feel the whale's forceful head shakes. then came the light. ""i just got thrown out of his mouth, into the water — there was white water everywhere,"" he said.  ""and i just was lying on the surface floating and saw his tail and he went back down.  and i was like, 'oh my god, i got out of that.  i survived. '""with the help of a friend who was fishing nearby and witnessed the incident, mayo gently pulled packard out of the water and removed his drysuit.  packard was calm and fully cognizant, mayo said, and told the men he thought his legs were broken.  they also worried that packard had an embolism because the whale drove him up to the surface so quickly, a ""no-no in diving,"" mayo said. mayo then called the ambulance, rescue squad and packard's wife and drove full-speed toward the dock. hospital staff were in awe of packard's story, he said in an ""ask me anything"" on reddit on sunday. ""i said 'i got stuck in a whale's mouth,'"" packard's son wrote on behalf of his father.  ""all the nurses and doctors at the hospital came to see me and ask me about it.  one nurse came in with a notepad, she asked me for lottery numbers!""after tests, doctors told packard he had no broken bones and there were no signs of an embolism.  his legs were badly bruised, and he had a dislocated knee.  doctors sent him home later that day. packard's story quickly spread throughout the town and eventually made national and international headlines.  though packard's experience appears fantastical, his reputation among locals as an experienced angler made his account all the more believable, mayo said. ""if it was some yahoo, i think we'd be arguing if it actually happened,"" mayo said.  ""you see him narrating what happened and it's just . . .  so very clearly true and obvious what happened. ""packard's bruised legs have forced him to stay grounded as they heal, but he's already planning his next trip out into the ocean. ""it looks like being the tough son of a gun he is, he's ready to be back at it as soon as he can be,"" mayo said.  ""i think we'll probably be diving in a week, which is pretty remarkable.

2021-06-16,Here's what it's like to be swallowed whole by a humpback whale.,"if you ever wondered what it would be like for a human to be swallowed by a humpback whale finding nemo style, 56-year-old lobster diver michael packard can now tell the tale. packard joined his son, jacob, for a reddit ask me anything yesterday, where he answered all pressing questions about what happened when he was fully swallowed by a whale while off the coast of provincetown, massachusetts while working last friday. read moreman, do the cubs need to shut uppickup trucks keep getting bigger, more dangeroushow to make your air conditioner more effective and efficient when temperatures soarlet's talk about <em>in the heights</em> and the erasure of dark-skinned afro-latinx folkshear me out: the infield fly rule is dumb and needs to be done away withaccording to packard, he was forty-five feet below the surface when he felt a shove, then he was consumed by darkness.  in the ama he says his initial thought was that it was a shark, but ""due to the lack of teeth and the size of it [he] soon realized that what [he] was in was a whale. ""packard was inside the whale's mouth for 30-40 seconds with limited mobility while the whale struggled to spit him out.  while inside the whale's mouth the diver lost his regulator.  thankfully he found it quickly, or he most likely would have suffocated in the pitch black.  convinced he was going to die that day, the father of two shared that his potential final thoughts were about his wife and kids. humpback whales are not known for going after humans and packard was likely swallowed by accident while the whale scoured for krill or small fish.  even if the whale was really determined to swallow packard whole, it's fist-wide throat would have prevented it.  when it comes to how it the creatures' mouth felt wrapped around his body, it's understandably difficult for packard to describe. ""it was full of water, and i could feel the muscles of its mouth convulsing around me, it was a really strange feeling to be sure,"" packard says.  ""can't draw a meaningful comparison. ""packard's friends swiftly rushed him to the cape cod hospital after the whale released him not too far from the boat, where he was treated for bruising and a dislocated knee.  at the hospital, packard says all the doctors and nurses stopped by to see him and hear his unbelievable story. ""one nurse came in with a notepad, she asked me for lottery numbers!"" packard says. the series deadliest catch shows that trapping and fishing can be gruesome, and it's common for lobster divers to get swept out to sea or die from the spins.  however, packard will not let his brush with death keep him from the work he's dedicated fifteen years of his life to for too long. ""speaking as jacob, i don't even need to ask this,"" his son says.  ""i have no doubt in my mind he will do everything he can to keep diving, it's his life and passion.

2021-06-16,Chinese rocket with manned crew to blast off Thursday.,"three astronauts will blast off from the gobi desert in china's first manned flight to its new space station (source: afp / china news service)astronauts blasting off on thursday for china's first manned mission to its new space station will have a choice of 120 different types of food and ""space treadmills"" for entertainment during their stay, china's space agency said. the mission will be china's longest crewed space mission to date and the first in nearly five years, as beijing pushes forward with its ambitious programme to establish itself as a space power. the astronauts will spend three months onboard the station, which has separate living modules for each of them, as well as a shared bathroom, dining area, and a communication centre to send emails and allow two-way video calls with ground control. the astronauts will be able to work off their range of dinner options — which officials assured reporters were all both nutritious and tasty — on the space treadmills or bicycles. the long march-2f rocket that will get them there will lift off at 9. 22 a. m.  local time (0122gmt) from the jiuquan launch centre base in northwest china's gobi desert, the china manned space agency (cmsa) said at a press conference on wednesday. the mission's commander, nie haisheng, was among the first batch of astronauts selected to be trained in 1998, and has already participated in two spaceflight missions. he is a decorated air force pilot in the people's liberation army, and the others in his team are also members of the chinese military. their shenzhou-12 spacecraft will dock with the main section of the tiangong space station, named tianhe, which was placed in orbit on april 29. another 11 missions are planned over the next year and a half to complete the construction of tiangong in orbit, including the attachment of solar panels and two laboratory modules. china's desire for a human outpost of its own in earth orbit was fuelled by a us ban on its astronauts on the international space station (iss). ""we are willing to carry out international cooperation with any country that is committed to the peaceful use of outer space,"" ji qiming of the cmsa told reporters on wednesday. the iss — a collaboration between the us, russia, canada, europe and japan — is due for retirement after 2024, although nasa has said it could potentially remain functional beyond 2028. tiangong — which will be much smaller than the iss — is expected to have a lifespan of at least 10 years. — afp © 2006 2021 the online citizen© 2006 2021 the online

""with the detection of more cases among the market and food centre staff and their close contacts, which suggests that there is ongoing spread with wider transmission, the closure of 115 bukit merah view market and food centre will be extended to june 26,"" it said. overall, there were 14 confirmed cases of covid-19 on tuesday, taking singapore's total to 62,315. all were locally transmitted within the community, with no new imported cases. four of the community cases are unlinked, and 10 are linked to existing cases. of the linked cases, five had already been placed under quarantine, while the other five were detected through surveillance. the four unlinked cases include a 36-year-old housewife who developed a fever on june 8 and lost her sense of taste and smell on june 10. she sought medical treatment on monday, when she visited a general practitioner, where she was administered both an antigen rapid test (art) and a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test. both test results came back positive for covid-19 infection.  her serology test result is pending. she is a household contact of a 35-year-old male singaporean who works as a senior executive at nets, and who is a linked case detected through surveillance. tuesday is the first day since june 29, 2020 to have zero imported cases reported. there were also no new cases from workers' dormitories. the weekly total number of community cases is 60 this week, down from 93 the previous week.  but the number of unlinked cases has risen to 18 in the past week, compared with 10 cases in the week before.  there are currently 44 active clusters, down from 46 on monday. as at tuesday night, 137 patients remain hospitalised, including two in critical condition in the intensive care unit, while 233 are recuperating at community facilities. singapore has had 34 deaths from covid-19 complications, while 15 who tested positive have died of other causes. read the full moh press release here. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

""the same two test kits are also available at watsons singapore and unity stores. their retail prices range from $10 to $13 per test kit, as recommended by the ministry of health (moh). the abbott panbio test kit costs $13 at guardian.  the same kit costs $12. 80 at unity and $13. 10 at watsons.  it is cheaper to purchase the tests in boxes of 10 or more. there were few buyers for the test kits when the straits times checked guardian, watsons and unity pharmacy outlets in jurong east, bukit panjang, potong pasir and toa payoh on wednesday morning (june 16). retiree ms j.  brown, 60, visited a watsons pharmacy at bukit panjang plaza on wednesday to purchase covid-19 test kits for her family as they are returning to britain in september this year. ""instead of going all the way (to the test centre), it's easier and more convenient if you have the kits,"" said ms brown, whose husband works in the oil and gas industry and whose daughter works in a school.

""the self-administered testing kits are meant to make testing fast, easy and accessible as singapore gradually resumes more activities. the self-administered tests will allow moh to detect infected cases more quickly, in particular among asymptomatic individuals and those concerned that they might have been exposed to covid-19. sales across all pharmacies are currently limited to 10 art kits per person to ensure there are adequate supplies for all. the guardian spokesman said its pharmacies have sufficient stock to cater to the expected demand. ""the limit of 10 kits has been set to ensure sufficient stocks for everyone. . .  our pharmacists will exercise discretion with regards to the sale of test kits and we will encourage customers to shop safely and purchase only what they need,"" she said.

individuals who have a positive result for their art self-test should immediately approach a swab and send home public health preparedness clinic for a confirmatory polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test, moh said. they are then required to self-isolate until they receive a negative pcr test result. 
meanwhile, those who test negative on their self-test art should still stay vigilant and adhere to prevailing safe management measures. individuals who have acute respiratory infection symptoms have also been urged to visit a doctor for a full diagnosis and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test instead of relying on an art self-test kit. the hsa has also noted that arts have a lower sensitivity than pcr tests and a higher chance of false negative results.  in general, arts can achieve a sensitivity of about 80 per cent for cases with higher viral loads and a specificity range of 97 per cent to 100 per cent, it added. sensitivity refers to a test's ability to identify those infected as positive, while specificity refers to a test's ability to correctly identify those not infected as negative. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

initial reports from israel and the united states suggest a small risk of myocarditis and pericarditis associated with the second dose of mrna covid-19 vaccines.  ― reuters pic

follow us on instagram and subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates. singapore, june 15 — the risk of medical complications from covid-19 continues to ""far outweigh"" that from getting the vaccines, such as heart conditions associated with the after-effects, three independent medical organisations said in a joint statement yesterday (june 14). the chapter of cardiologists at the college of physicians, the academy of medicine and the singapore cardiac society said that they continue to recommend covid-19 vaccination for eligible patients and will continue to ""monitor the situation closely and provide professional guidance accordingly"".  ""covid-19 vaccination greatly reduces the risk of infection and its serious complications in the majority of individuals, and helps the population achieve herd immunity,"" they added.                              singapore has approved two vaccines for use here from pharmaceutical firms pfizer-biontech and moderna, which are the vaccines the three organisations refer to in their statement. these vaccines use the new messenger ribonucleic acid (mrna) technology to ""instruct"" human cells to make a spike protein that triggers an immune system response against the coronavirus.  the spike protein is what viruses use to enter human cells and cause infection. this is different from the traditional approach where a weakened or inactivated virus with its whole spike protein is used in vaccines to produce antibodies. last friday, the ministry of health (moh) said in a news release that its expert committee for covid-19 vaccination has advised ""adolescents and younger men"" to avoid strenuous physical activity for a week after their second dose of the mrna vaccines as a precaution against a ""small risk"" of heart inflammation.  they should also seek medical attention promptly if they develop chest pain, shortness of breath or abnormal heartbeats. in singapore, as of june 7, the health sciences authority (hsa) has reported four men aged 18 to 30 having myocarditis or pericarditis after they received their second jab. another two cases involved a man and a woman who are both above 40 years old. these are inflammatory conditions affecting the heart muscles (myocarditis) and the lining covering the heart (pericarditis). the three medical organisations noted in their statement that various reports suggest that covid-19 is associated with both myocarditis and pericarditis, adding that ""published rates vary widely"".  in the largest and most complete of these studies, all patients — all young competitive athletes — who were infected by the coronavirus later underwent cardiac mri scans, they added. the study showed that the incidence of myocarditis was 2. 3 per cent (ranging from 0 to 7. 6 per cent at different institutions), the equivalent of 2,300 for every 100,000 patients infected. ""the data so far is only available for the mrna vaccines produced by pfizer-biontech and moderna. ""initial reports from israel and the united states suggest a small risk of myocarditis and pericarditis associated with the second dose of the mrna covid-19 vaccines. ""our own singapore data is too small to be definitive,"" the organisations said. ""nonetheless, preliminary estimates from the us suggest that the overall risk from the second dose of the mrna vaccines is about 1. 6 cases per 100,000 doses, with risk primarily in males under the age of 30. ""hsa has said that the two cases in singapore of those above 40 years of age ""is within the baseline incidence rate"", while the four involving the men aged 18 to 30 ""is at the upper end of the expected range for this age group, based on background incidence rates"". the three organisations added yesterday that people who develop chest discomfort, breathlessness or palpitations after covid-19 vaccination should seek urgent medical attention. ""after vaccination, and especially after the second dose, strenuous activity should be avoided for one week. "" ― todayloading. . . © 2021, malay mail, all rights reserved.

2021-06-16,Lawrence Wong hints at possible delay in Phase 3 reopening.,"singapore — finance minister and multi-ministry taskforce (mtf) co-chair lawrence wong has raised the possibility of a delay in the next stage of singapore's re-opening following a recent outbreak of covid-19 community cases.  in a video posted on his facebook page on wednesday (16 june), wong noted that a further easing of pandemic restrictions, including the resumption of dining in at hawker centres and eateries, is scheduled to take place on 21 june.  singapore is currently in phase 3 (heightened alert) of its reopening, which started on 14 june. ""unfortunately, we've had a latest outbreak of cases and we are likely to be dealing now with a very large cluster in bukit merah, where the cases are breaking out not only at the market and the hawker centre but also all around the vicinity.  and day by day we are seeing the number of cases, the cryptic cases in the community are likely to be rising too,"" he said. wong was referring to a cluster of infections linked to the bukit merah view market and food centre, which currently has 25 cases. with this in mind, wong added the government is ""evaluating the timeline and the scope of our second stage of opening"" and, in consultation with public health experts, would announce its decision soon. ""we want to ensure that we do not have another flare up before we reach sufficiently high levels of vaccination in our community,"" he said. in the video, wong also demonstrated the use of an antigen rapid test (art) kit, which can be used for self-testing to detect covid-19.  these kits are currently available at all major pharmacies, with prices ranging from $10 to $13.

2021-06-16,"'If he dies, I also die with him': Man who rescued son after electric shock from lamp post says he feared the worst , Singapore News.","it was his day off and he was resting at home, nursing a fever after getting his second covid-19 vaccine dose a day earlier. mr muhammad nazlan was watching tv with his wife on sunday night while their three children were out at the playground, located about 50m in front of his housing board unit. suddenly, his daughter, 10, burst into their first-storey flat, screaming and crying. mr muhammad, 34, a pest control technician, told the new paper yesterday: ""i could not hear what exactly she was saying.  all i knew was something bad had happened to my son. ""i rushed out with my wife and saw my son lying on the ground, his arm stuck to a lamp post.  my son was unconscious but his eyes were still open, and i thought he was gone. ""his eldest son, 14-year-old muhammad rifqy, was playing football with a friend when both teenagers got an electric shock from a lamp post near the fitness corner at block 63 lorong 5 toa payoh. the singapore civil defence force (scdf) said it received a call for assistance at 8. 25pm and two people were taken to kk women's and children's hospital. mr muhammad said his son was initially in the intensive care unit but was moved to a regular ward on monday afternoon.  he said rifqy's friend had been discharged. while his son is conscious, mr muhammad's friend, mr khairul anuar, 36, said rifqy is ""not his old self"" yet. ""i have been talking to him through video calls.  he is traumatised and his speech is slurred.  sometimes he talks using one word at a time.  but at least he is slowly recovering,"" said mr khairul, a grabfood rider. [[nid:532833]]it could have been much worse, if not for mr muhammad's prompt action. rifqy had lost consciousness from an electric shock after he went to retrieve a ball that had rolled towards the lamp post. ""when i saw him lying there, i quickly tried to pull him away from the lamp post but his arm was stuck to it,"" said mr muhammad, who is asthmatic. ""that part of his arm looked like it was burned.  my heart felt like something sharp poked it, and i became breathless.  i also felt another two shocks, one in my hand and one in my leg, as i used my hand to pull him away. ""all i could think of was: if he dies, i also die with him. ""mr muhammad said his son seemed as if he had tensed up, and he felt helpless. ""i felt like a useless father because i wanted to give him cpr (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) but people around me were reminding me not to touch him,"" he said. the scdf arrived moments later to tend to his son and the friend. mr muhammad said his son told him the two had got to know each other three days prior to their sunday meeting, and the boy received a jolt when he touched rifqy. when tnp visited the scene yesterday afternoon, workers were completing the installation of four new lamp posts. mr muhammad, whose youngest is a five-year-old boy, said staff from bishan-toa payoh town council (btptc), which manages the estate, had contacted him and offered assistance. in a statement last night, the town council said it had completed checks to establish the probable cause of the electric shock. ""the btptc licensed electrical worker (lew) noticed a small tear to the insulation of the live wire inside the lamp post.  this would not be visible unless we remove the junction box. ""from the finding, the lew assessed that the exposed part of the wire touching the metal part of the lamp post could be the cause of the electric shock,"" said the town council. ""the lew has also checked other lamp posts within the same circuitry and found no similar situation.  the incident could be an isolated case as there was also no previous similar incident of such nature. ""the btptc added that works to rectify the issue were completed yesterday and it will ""continue to ensure the safety of (the) electrical installations (it manages)"". ""i have lived in this flat for 13 years.  my children have been playing at the playground since they were babies.  but now, even with new lamp posts installed, i am not sure if it is safe to let my kids play outside any more,"" said mr muhammad. ""all i can think of is if my son will recover fully.  i am worried because this is not just a fall or a fracture.  i don't know how he will be affected by this in the long run.

'so happy': christian eriksen's incredible update delights fans'out of this world': euro 2020 stunned by 'ridiculous' momentcoca-cola is the official sponsor of euro 2020 and have placed two bottles in front of everyone speaking at press conferences. but in a viral moment that has sent social media users into a frenzy, ronaldo picked up the two coca-cola bottles and put them out of sight before holding up his water bottle and saying: ""drink water. ""coca-cola probably wouldn't have been impressed by ronaldo's actions, and even less so after taking a look at the stock market on tuesday. the company saw a staggering $5. 2 billion (au) wiped off its market value in the hours after ronaldo's press conference. according to the athletic, coca-cola's shares were worth $73. 02 each before the press conference, but dropped to $71. 85 afterwards. that 1. 6 per cent drop in value is worth the eye-watering total of $5. 2 billion. coca-cola released a statement after ronaldo's presser, saying ""everyone is entitled to their drink preferences"" and everyone has different ""tastes and needs"". on tuesday, ronaldo became the all-time top scorer at the european championships after two goals in the final minutes helped title holders portugal beat hungary 3-0 in their group f opener. ronaldo now has 11 goals, taking sole possession of the record he previously shared with france's michel platini on nine. portugal finally broke the deadlock in a game they dominated thanks to raphael guerreiro six minutes from time just after hungary had a goal ruled out for offside. a ronaldo penalty and a second effort added to the final score, which was harsh on hungary who worked hard in front of a packed puskas area in budapest the only stadium to be filled to capacity at the euros due to the coronavirus pandemic. portugal had no trouble controlling the first half but struggled to convert their chances created into goals. diego jota had a good early opportunity but his powerful header was saved by hungary keeper peter gulacsi, who also managed to block an attempt by ronaldo in the 19th minute when the portuguese superstar was already offside. ronaldo then wrote his name in the record books with a goal from the spot late in the match after willi orban fouled rafa silva in the box.  the portuguese superstar then scored his 106th for portugal and closed the gap to iranian ali daei's record (109) of the all-time men's international top goalscorer. ""it was important to win, it was a difficult game,"" ronaldo said.  ""i'm grateful to the team for helping me to score two goals and be the man of the match.  now we must go on. ""hungary's szalai said the defeat ""is frustrating"" and that portugal ""didn't work enough to score,"" while keeper gulacsi believed they needed a little luck to score a goal. also read: if you had invested rs 25,000 in bitcoin in 2015 this is how rich you would behere's how much money bill gates makes per minutehow much does mark zuckerberg spend on his security?who is the secretive bitcoin billionaire who invented bitcoin?

2021-06-16,Olympics organisers to unveil COVID-19 'playbook' as IOC's Coates arrives in Tokyo.,"tokyo: olympics organisers prepared on tuesday (jun 15) to unveil their latest ""playbook"" of rules to control covid-19 infections as japan's government pondered whether to extend a state of emergency and senior olympics official john coates arrived in tokyo. coates, a vice-president of the international olympic committee (ioc) and its point-man for the event, sparked a backlash last month when he said the games would go ahead even if tokyo were under a state of emergency due to the pandemic. japan's government is considering ending the state of emergency in tokyo and several other prefectures as scheduled on jun 20, butkeeping some curbssuch as on restaurant hours until the olympics start in july, domestic media have said. economics minister yasutoshi nishimura, in charge of japan's covid-19 response, said that with hospital occupancy and infection rates still high, it was too soon to talk as if lifting the state of emergency was a done deal. ""now is a critical time to call on the public, to suppress infections and to take initiatives for a stable supply of hospital beds,"" he said.  a decision on the emergency could come as early as thursday, media reported. organisers' rules, known as a ""playbook"", already mandate wearing masks by athletes and others in most situations and frequent testing for covid-19. athletes and members of the media, whose movements will be restricted, will be subject to gps monitoring for the first 14 days of their stay in japan. the latest update was set to be announced later on tuesday. about 11,000 athletes and 78,000 journalists, officials and staff are expected at the games. japan has not suffered the explosive outbreaks seen elsewhere but has still recorded more than 772,000 cases and over 14,000 deaths. a slow vaccination rollout, though recently accelerating, means only 13per cent of the population has received at least one shot. suga's support slidesa jun 1 to 9 online survey of companies by think tank tokyo shoko research showed 64 per cent favoured cancelling or postponing the games due to such concerns as the spread of the virus and slow vaccinations. nearly 60 per cent said doing so would hurt their businesses but just over 40 per cent expected a positive impact. olympic minister tamayo marukawa told a news conference that pfizer inc would provide doses of its covid-19 vaccine to an additional 20,000 people involved in the olympics and paralympics, kyodo news agency reported, doubling the amount previously promised by the us pharmaceutical firm. some 80 per cent of qualified athletes have already been vaccinated and the ioc is pushing to raise the number. japan's often patchy response to the coronavirus has eroded support for prime minister yoshihide suga. a survey by nhk public tv showed 37 per cent approved of his government against 45 per cent who disapproved, the highest disapproval rating since he took office last september. more than two-thirds were not persuaded by his explanation of why the games should be held or how they would be made safe. just under one-third wanted the games cancelled while 61 per cent wanted either a cap on spectators or no spectators at all.  organisers have already decided against allowing spectators from abroad and will make a call on domestic spectators later this month. reflecting the role of money in decisions to forge ahead, nbcuniversal chief executive jeff shell said on monday the event could be the most profitable olympics in nbc's history.  nbcuniversal, owned by comcast corp, paid us$7. 65 billion to extend its us broadcast rights for the olympics through 2032. the games could provide an opportunity for diplomacy.  japan's yomiuri newspaper said south korean president moon jae-in was arranging a visit to japan timed with the games and seoul is hoping moon will hold his first ever talks with suga then. japan's top government spokesman, however, denied a summit was in the works amid a spat over islets claimed by both countries. the relationship between south korea and japan has soured in recent years due to disputes over the islets, war-time history and trade. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

""shakthipriya is among those stepping up to help those affected by the pandemic, including businesses affected by the dining-in ban. to support food and beverage (f&b) social enterprises badly hit by the restrictions, non-profit organisation be kind sg compiled a list of them on facebook and encouraged people to patronise them. founder of be kind sg, ms sherry soon, 40, felt it was especially important to highlight f&b businesses employing people with special needs during this time. ""social enterprises may have to let go of their staff if there is no business, and these staff may not be able to be re-employed as other employers may not give them a chance,"" she says. other organisations, such as kb free soup for all and krsna's free meals, are providing free meals to those affected by the pandemic. kb free soup for all is a soup kitchen initiative operating from june 7 to july 2.  it is organised by social enterprise m2 cafe and food-sharing group kampungbishan.  every weekday, the soup kitchen provides 100 takeaway packets of soup and rice from noon to 2pm at m2 cafe at the adelphi. the cafe had been struggling to survive due to the fall in dine-in traffic.  after phase two (heightened alert) restrictions kicked in, owner toh kian beng, 41, decided to halt operations. but his desire to help marginalised communities led him to adapt the restaurant space into a soup kitchen.  ""apart from the hundreds of people who have been nourished by our warm soup and rice, i hope that more individuals can receive hope from our initiative,"" he says.

in a similar spirit, krsna's free meals launched a fund-raising campaign on give. asia last month, after the number of migrant workers and locals who approached it doubled during this period. the registered soup kitchen serves 850 to 1,000 breakfast meals and about 600 lunch meals daily at its premises in little india. having raised $20,853 at the end of the campaign, which exceeded the goal by $853, it plans to source for more affordable ingredients to diversify its breakfast offerings and provide more fruit. ms latha govindasamy, 52, a public relations executive for krsna's free meals, says: ""we have made it a habit to introduce good food and fruit to build up the immunity of our beneficiaries, who usually do not make their health a priority. ""

meanwhile, from now until sunday, cafe arteastiq depatio at plaza singapura is giving free pizzas to students from low-income families. in support of the straits times school pocket money fund (stspmf), it has teamed up with car enthusiast group sg convertible club to launch the ""drop a good cause, drop a message, drop a pizza"" initiative.  consumers can buy any pizza at half-price from the cafe to give to stspmf beneficiaries and the organisers will provide another pizza for free to the fund's beneficiaries. ms tan bee heong, 55, general manager of the fund, thinks this is a ""very welcome treat"" for lowincome families, especially when many parents have lost their jobs due to covid-19. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

""it was our first match and it was a huge game,"" said france coach didier deschamps.  ""it could have been a semi-final or a final.  but we have the three points that will be very important. ""they are tough to play against but we were there, on the spot.  this win does a lot of good. "" germany's record 50th euro match got off to a tentative start before a couple of french chances fell to pogba and kylian mbappe. the visitors' gradual pressure paid off when pogba launched an outstanding cross-field pass to hernandez, who cut the ball back only for hummels, who had been dropped more than two years ago and was recalled for the tournament, to clip it into the roof of the net past his own goalkeeper manuel neuer. the germans were desperate to impress in front of a home crowd to make amends for their shock 2018 world cup first-round exit, but instead they rarely broke through the french rearguard. when they did it was usually with robin gosens from the left, and one of his crosses found ilkay gundogan, whose shot veered wide of the post. it was france who almost scored again in the 52nd when another quick break saw adrien rabiot cut in from the left but he hit the post with neuer already moving in the opposite direction. that looked to shake the hosts into action, and they carved out three consecutive chances, with gosens again in the mix, until an injury to benjamin pavard around the hour mark gave the french some much-needed respite. france gradually conceded possession but remained lethal on the break with mbappe and karim benzema both putting the ball in the net but having their efforts ruled offside. mbappe was also denied what looked like a penalty after out-sprinting hummels to chase down a long ball in the 78th minute, but replays showed the german got just enough boot to the ball to prevent a shot before mbappe went to ground. ""it was a brutally intense game and we fought until the end,"" germany coach joachim loew said. ""an own goal decided it.  i cannot blame the team because we fought a lot.  we maybe lacked a bit of punching power in and around the box. ""tomorrow, we have to process things but look ahead.  we lost, we are disappointed, but we still have two games and we can fix it.

2021-06-16,Unplayable Pogba serves bittersweet reminder of his Ballon d'Or potential as France beat Germany at Euro 2020.,"france 1-0 germany: match statisticsit's taken as something of a given that if france win euro 2020, this year's ballon d'or will go to either n'golo kante or kylian mbappe, and the reasoning is sound.  both men, after all, are coming off the back of extraordinary club campaigns. yet watching france beat germany in their group f opener on tuesday night, it was hard not to wonder why paul pogba isn't in the mix.  not because he deserves to be because of his form in 2021 to date, but because he should be given his extraordinary talent.  it's now seven years since gianluigi buffon tipped up his then-juventus team-mate as a future ballon d'or winner: ""he is one of those players that leaves you open-mouthed. ""he still is, too – he proved that again at allianz arena – yet nobody could claim pogba has been anything close to the best player in world football this year.  the incredibly frustrating thing about pogba is that dominant displays like the one he produced in france's 1-0 win in munich still feel like the exception rather than the rule.  manchester united fans could be forgiven for wondering where on earth this version of pogba was during last month's europa league final loss to villarreal, but then, the 28-year-old has long been a very different player for club and country.  roy keane and patrick vieira, two of the greatest midfielders of the modern era, later debated why this is the case on itv but pogba himself has never made any secret of the fact that he feels better utilised in the international arena than at old trafford.   ""in manchester, i have the freedom to go into the box, but the priority is to play, to defend,"" pogba told l'equipe.  ""in the france team, we play a 4-2-3-1 too and i'm a little more involved in the transition, in the construction.  i have more freedom than in manchester to get into the box, to make runs forward. ""against germany, pogba appeared to be everywhere, breaking up play with ferocious force, picking out passes under intense pressure and generally bossing the game with his awesome mix of power and precision.  of course, it's easier to dictate the play when you have n'golo kante alongside you, and the chelsea man had another excellent game – but this was pogba at his very best, turning in one of those ridiculously composed performances in which he reminds everyone of his full repertoire of skills. from a defensive perspective, he regained possession more than any other player (12 times), while no player won more headers or made more interceptions (three apiece). offensively, it was he who played the outrageous outside-of-the-boot pass out to lucas hernandez that led to mats hummels' own goal.  unsurprisingly, he was also involved in the build-up to france's two disallowed goals, from kylian mbappe and karim benzema. he was utterly unplayable at times and it was no coincidence that he was the most fouled player on the pitch, too.  at one point, it even seemed that germany defender antonio rudiger tried to take a bite out of him in a desperate bid to rattle pogba. there was

2021-06-16,"If the Peoples' Association can't really represent all people, is it obsolete?.","ever since ms sarah bagharib called the peoples' association (pa) out for using her wedding photographs without her permission in its hari raya aidilfitri display at an hdb estate in tiong bahru, it has generated a firestorm of debate.  this alongside a number of disturbing videos that have surfaced, depicting blatantly racist behaviour has led a number of politicians from both the peoples' action party (pap) front and the opposition fronts to opine. perhaps bowing to public pressure, the pa has issued an apology of sorts to ms sarah.  i say ""an apology of sorts"" because while the word ""apologise"" has been used, it is an apology that is loaded with caveats and reservations. i accept that neither the pa nor the third-party vendor may have been intentionally racist — this begs the question: can something be racist without a racist intent?this is a nuanced question without a simple answer.  it is however important to acknowledge that when managing people's emotions and feelings, there is never a simple answer and we must not let our desire to be efficient cloud our empathy. first things first, i think it is probably fair to say that singapore is systemically set up to cater for the majority chinese race.  from advertisements on tv to speaking only chinese in certain restaurants, the subtext is that the minorities must adapt.  one might say this makes logical sense but i would urge you to pause there.  many of our minority fellow citizens are not new immigrants.  they like us (the majority race) were born and bred here, the descendants of immigrants.  for some of our malay brothers and sisters, they have been geographically here way before we were!secondly, while all of these policies that have placed efficiency above all else may not have had a racist intention, it nevertheless could result in racism.   let me give you an example. on every administration form ranging from local job applications to joining a gym, they ask what race you are.  when the practice started, it may have just been a question of simple efficiency.  listing your race upfront makes it easy to gather data etc.  but the shadow of this approach is that it gives an opportunity for those who may harbour racist intentions to exclude races they do not like.  so, this is an example of non-racist intentions giving birth to racist effects. by simply focussing on intent, we are missing the forest for the trees.  this isn't a blame game — it is about the acknowledgement that some practices have had racist effects (regardless of intent) and we must do better because the damage is real!the pa has bristled at accusations that it could be racist, preferring to hide behind the term ""culturally insensitive"".  but calling a spade a spade, isn't cultural insensitivity a part of racism, albeit on a lower scale?""these are accusations we reject.  while the error was culturally insensitive, it was certainly not racist.  it is not right to raise the allegation of racism, without basis, to stoke emotions and sentiments"". from the pa's perspective, they are part of a structure that is very much dominated and run in a way that caters systematically to the benefit of the majority chinese race.  while they run events that ostensibly celebrate minority culture, it seems to be done more as a box-ticking exercise.  in other words, it is done on autopilot without much thought. this is the crux of the issue with the usage of ms sarah's photographs.  it was lazy because the pa has fallen into the trap of stereotyping and generalising minorities.  hari raya equals malay.  malay costume equals hari raya.  it may not be intentional racism, but it still has racist effects.  this is especially so if the lived experience of the minorities in singapore is one where this sorts of casual and careless racism plague their daily existence. so, is it really right for the pa to dismiss this as an ""isolated incident""? is it also not itself making an accusation that ms sarah is stoking sentiments when it does not want to be accused of being racist? pot calling kettle black!this is the terminology that can have a gaslighting effect.  many have also dismissed the video of mr dave parkash being chastised by a senior lecturer from ngee ann polytechnic as an ""isolated incident"".  but is it really? people all over social media have shared their own experiences of being minorities in singapore and it is clearly not ""an isolated incident"".  is highlighting incidences of racism, however inadvertently ""stoking emotions or sentiments""? is the pa saying that minorities should just suck it up?while the pa may not have made this exact mistake before, can it categorically say that it has not been guilty of racial stereotype and other incidences of racist effects without intent?for the pa to call it simply an ""oversight"" is just not good enough.  it isn't an oversight.  it is a lack of regard and that is what they should be apologising for.  it is fine to state that it had not intended to be racist but despite that, the lack of care did result in a racist outcome.  apologise for the outcome and pledge to do better.  end of story. the pa has claimed that it finds ms sarah's public call for messages or suggestions that they would like to have relayed to the organisation in their meeting an ""odd"" one. i appreciate the pa's point of view if it misguidedly views this as an ""isolated incident"".  but you see, if you truly listen to the lived experience of minorities, this is not at all an isolated incident.  minorities do not often have a platform because we don't allow them one.  every time something is raised, we silence them with the hammer of ""this is an isolated incident"".  is it really that surprising that ms sarah is trying to give voice to the many minorities who have not been given a voice?yes it ""has gone far beyond the radin mas incident"" but it needs to and the pa is a good start.  after all, isn't it called the peoples' association? if it cannot represent the people, then maybe it is obsolete. let's not miss a golden opportunity to have a much-needed discussion. to simply issue a surface apology without deep reflection hoping that the matter will die down is just not good enough because this issue isn't just about the use of photographs without permission.  it is a reflection of our society's ignorance.  if we accept the pa's apology as it stands, we are

2021-06-16,"The Guardian view on Biden, China and Europe: the US is back.","democratic unity is welcome against authoritarian might.  that doesn't mean signing up to everything on the us agendalast modified on tue 15 jun 2021 22. 46 edtit is 50 years next month since henry kissinger embarked on the secret mission to beijing that led to a rapprochement: ""it is the conviction of president nixon that a strong and developing people's republic of china poses no threat to any essential us interest,"" the national security adviser assured leaders there.  half a century on, the thaw is over.  the thread running through joe biden's first foreign trip as president is the need for democratic alliances against growing authoritarian might, and though attention now turns to his meeting with vladimir putin on wednesday, the administration's real focus has been on china.  while beijing's record on the pandemic, trade, human rights and other specific areas has rightly raised deep concern internationally, the underlying issue is its rise, and the decline of us power. ""the us is ill and very ill indeed,"" foreign ministry spokesman zhao lijian declared in beijing on tuesday.  washington's waning power was exemplified by donald trump, with his erratic pronouncements and conduct, veneration of autocrats and contempt for allies.  yet if mr biden has largely defined himself in opposition to his predecessor, he often sounds strikingly similar on china.  his approach too is shaped by domestic politics: talking tough on beijing offers some prospect of political unity in a deeply divided country, should help to ward off republican attacks on that front, and recognises that the business world is shifting. the us knows it must work with china on the climate crisis – with the critical cop26 talks due this autumn – and says it does not want a cold war.  mr biden has shunned his predecessor's racism.  but the overall hawkish tone struck on china, including briefings around the ""lab leak"" pandemic theory, has a cold war feel and broader repercussions – with people of east asian descent, who have nothing to do with decisions in beijing, facing hostility and attacks. in europe, as elsewhere, mr biden has an opportunity created by the backlash against chinese policies and ""wolf warrior"" diplomacy.  there are signs that china's push for influence is faltering: the european parliament froze an investment deal following tit-for-tat sanctions over beijing's treatment of the uyghurs; lithuania quit the ""17+1"" mechanism for dialogue with central and eastern europe last month; and plans for a chinese university campus in hungary are on hold. nato leaders this week declared china a security risk, ""present[ing] systemic challenges to the rules-based international order"".  but the ongoing differences on handling beijing are evident.  emmanuel macron was swift to add that ""china has little to do with the north atlantic"" and that it was important ""we don't bias our relationship"".  similarly, angela merkel reportedly expressed concern that the g7 is ""not about being against something, but for something"".  strategic instincts as well as commercial interests work against buying into the us agenda wholesale. many anticipate that a new german chancellor will turn the country's china policy in a more critical direction.  but while the us is right that democratic countries must pull together on important issues, decisions cannot and should not be by american diktat.  european countries are right to be wary of dancing to the us tune – not least because they wonder what kind of leader could be in charge four years from now. as mr biden has recognised, the us-china competition will be shaped in large part by the performance of the us: how it looks at home, as well as whether projects such as the g7 infrastructure initiative materialise in any significant way.  (the g7's failure to reach a better deal on vaccine-sharing does not bode well. ) while favourable perceptions of the us and confidence in its president soared after he took office, only 17% of those surveyed in 12 countries saw american democracy as a good example for other countries to follow.  america is back, we were told this week.  but we are in a multilateral world now, and its position will depend not only on pursuing economic and technical superiority, but healing its politics and society too.

2021-06-16,"Heart inflammation after Covid-19 jab rare: Experts, Latest Singapore News.","heart conditions associated with the covid-19 mrna vaccines are extremely rare and it remains unclear if the vaccines are responsible for them, experts told the straits times after a handful of cases raised some concerns. six individuals here were reported to have suffered myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after getting an mrna vaccine, among whom four are men younger than 30. the other two are a man and a woman both aged above 40. the health sciences authority (hsa) said most of the cases occurred within a few days after receiving the second dose of the vaccine, and that all have recovered or been discharged from hospital. the united states and israel two major users of the mrna vaccines have also reported a slightly increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis in young men after the second dose of mrna vaccination. but there is no need to be overly concerned as these events are rare, experts said. professor ooi eng eong, an expert on emerging infectious diseases at duke-nus medical school, said it also remains unclear if it is indeed mrna vaccines causing these adverse events and how vaccination could have resulted in them. as at june 7, more than 1,888,000 people in singapore have received both doses of mrna vaccines by either pfizer-biontech or moderna. an article last friday by the american academy of paediatrics cited a rate of 16 cases of myocarditis/pericarditis for every one million second doses in people aged 16 to 39. such inflammation of the heart was also reported in some covid-19 patients last year, most likely the result of an overactive immune system giving rise to the inflammation. vaccine maker moderna issued a statement last friday stating it is aware of reports of such cases after people took its vaccine, but added that it has not established a causal association with its vaccine after carefully reviewing the available safety data to date. as mrna vaccines lead to a similar but milder immune response, they could also give rise to inflammation, said prof ooi. ""but these cases, if indeed caused by the vaccine, will be much fewer compared with covid-19-induced heart inflammation ones. ""it is also important to note that the occurrence of some rare events is natural for any vaccine, especially when large numbers have been vaccinated, he stressed. ""no other vaccine has come under the scrutiny as covid-19 vaccines.  in about six months, over 1. 5 billion people have been vaccinated under close observation,"" added prof ooi. he said it is unclear why young men may be more susceptible, and that it is difficult to conduct the necessary studies to determine a correlation. ""nonetheless, we can expect more detailed description of what happens to these cases in the coming months, from those that have been treated in the us and israel.  the picture may become clearer then.

2021-06-16,COVID-19 task force 'evaluating' timing and scope of reopening amid fresh outbreak: Lawrence Wong.,"singapore: the covid-19 multi-ministry task force is ""evaluating the timing and scope"" of the next stage of singapore's reopening, finance minister lawrence wong said in a facebook post on wednesday (jun 16). ""we are now at stage 1 of our reopening.  stage 2 is scheduled next monday.  unfortunately we now have new cases breaking out and a major new cluster in bukit merah,"" said mr wong, who co-chairs the task force. ""given these developments, we are evaluating the timing and scope of the next stage of reopening.  the mtf is studying the situation carefully with public health experts and will provide further updates soon. ""as of tuesday, thebukit merah view market and food centrecovid-19 cluster consisted of 25 cases. in a video accompanying his facebook post, mr wong said that the new covid-19 cases in bukit merah are ""breaking out not only in the market and the hawker centre, but also, all around the vicinity"". ""and day by day, we are seeing the number of unlinked cases, the cryptic cases in the community are likely to be rising too,"" he said. the market, which was slated to reopen on wednesday after being closed since sunday, will now be shut for two weeks until jun 26. explaining the decision on tuesday, the ministry of health (moh) said that the detection of more cases among employees at the market and their close contacts suggests there is ""ongoing spread with wider transmission"". all staff and tenants who had been working at the market from may 25 were placed on quarantine, and will be tested during quarantine. all 85 tenants and workers of the neighbouring 116 bukit merah view have also been tested for covid-19, while free covid-19 testing has been extended to members of the public who had visited the shops at 115 and 116 bukit merah view between may 25 and jun 12. stallholders atredhill market and food centre, which is a short walk away from bukit merah view market and food centre, will undergo mandatory swab tests after a covid-19 case recently visited the market. ""i know this is a difficult time for everyone,"" mr wong said. ""i want to assure all of you that we are doing our very best to control the infection  and we want to ensure that we do not have another flare-up before we reach sufficiently high levels of vaccination in our community. ""dining-in at food and beverage outlets is currently banned as part of phase 3 (heightened alert) and was scheduled to resume onjun 21, provided the covid-19 situation remained under control. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-16,South Korea failing to tackle widespread digital sex crimes: Human Rights Watch report.,"seoul: south korean authorities are failing to properly tackle the country's widespread digital sex crimes against women, which have a devastating impact on victims, a human rights watch (hrw) report said on wednesday (jun 16). south korea is the world's 12th largest economy and a leading technological power, but remains a male-dominated society with a poor record on women's rights. digital sex crimes, or the sharing of intimate pictures or video without permission, are a massive problem in the country, where ""molka"" or spycam videos secretly filmed in public places are common, as is ""revenge porn"" private sex videos filmed or shared non-consensually by disgruntled exes. south korean officials ""in the criminal legal system most of whom are men often seem to simply not understand, or not accept, that these are very serious crimes"", said hrw's heather barr, the report author. in 2019, almost 45 per cent of sexual digital crime cases were dropped by the country's prosecution, compared with 19 per cent of robbery cases and 27. 7 per cent of homicides, the report said. even when there were convictions, it found almost 80 per cent of perpetrators received just ""a suspended sentence, a fine, or a combination of the two"" last year. ""digital sex crimes have become so common, and so feared . . .  they are affecting the quality of life of all women and girls,"" barr said. spycams have become so prevalent that female police officers now regularly inspect public toilets, with women telling hrw they avoided using the amenities altogether. one woman who spoke to barr was given a clock by a male employer, which she put in her bedroom only later finding out the device had been streaming footage to him for over a month. victims often feel deep shame and are socially ostracised, and an ""alarming number"" told hrw they had contemplated suicide. the report comes as an anti-feminist backlash grows in south korea, with companies accused of endorsing ""radical feminism"" being boycotted by some men. barr said ""widely accepted harmful views"" about women and girls were the root cause of the phenomenon. the government has ""not sent a clear and forceful message that women and men are equal,"" she said. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-16,New Israel government faces early test with far-right march.,"jerusalem: israel's fledgling new government faced an early test tuesday (jun 15) as jewish ultranationalists prepared to march into annexed east jerusalem, stoking tensions the un has warned threaten a fragile gaza ceasefire. rallies by far-right jewish groups in arab neighbourhoods have raised tensions in recent months, prompting a police intervention in the flashpoint al-aqsa mosque compound that triggered the deadliest flare-up of israeli-palestinian violence since 2014. the so-called march of the flags, which celebrates the anniversary of israel's 1967 occupation of the city's eastern sector, was originally scheduled for last thursday but was delayed due to israeli police opposition to the route and warnings from gaza's islamist rulers hamas. the former government of veteran premier benjamin netanyahu put off the march until tuesday, a decision confirmed late monday by the incoming government of prime minister naftali bennett. ""the right to demonstrate is a right in all democracies,"" said internal security minister omer bar-lev. ""the police is ready and we will do everything in our power to preserve the delicate thread of coexistence. ""organisers consulted police on the best route for the march that begins at 1430 gmt to avoid friction with arab residents, the government said. but palestinian prime minister mohammad shtayyeh condemned it as a provocation. ""we warn of the dangerous repercussions that may result from the occupying power's intention to allow extremist israeli settlers to carry out the flag march in occupied jerusalem tomorrow,"" shtayyeh tweeted in english. he said it was ""a provocation and aggression against our people, jerusalem and its sanctities that must end"". the new israeli premier is himself a jewish nationalist but the coalition he leads also includes centrist and left-wing parties and, for the first time in the country's history, an arab party. the support of the four lawmakers of the islamic conservative raam party was vital to the wafer-thin majority that the government won in a historic confidence vote that unseated netanyahu on sunday. ""very fragile""un middle east peace envoy tor wennesland urged all sides to behave responsibly to avoid damage to a hard-won may 21 ceasefire that ended 11 days of heavy fighting in and around gaza. ""tensions are rising again in jerusalem at a very fragile & sensitive security & political time, when un & egypt are actively engaged in solidifying the ceasefire,"" wennesland said. ""urge all relevant parties to act responsibly & avoid any provocations that could lead to another round of confrontation. ""the us embassy called on its staff to avoid entering the walled old city in the heart of east jerusalem because of the march and ""possible counter-demonstrations"". israel's annexation of east jerusalem since the six-day war of 1967 is not recognised by most of the international community which says the city's final status should be a matter of negotiation between the two sides. the palestinians claim the city's eastern sector as the capital of their future state. hamas warningthe iconic al-aqsa mosque compound in the heart of the old city is islam's third holiest site and a national symbol for all palestinians regardless of religion. it is also judaism's holiest site but by longstanding convention jews are not allowed to pray inside the compound and visits by israeli jewish politicians often trigger disturbances. when the march was originally announced for last week, senior hamas official khalil hayya warned it could spark a return to violence like that of may 10-21. ""we warn the occupation (israel) against letting the march approach east jerusalem and al-aqsa mosque compound,"" hayya said. ""we hope the message is clear so that thursday doesn't become (a new) may 10. ""last month's conflict started after hamas issued a deadline for israel to remove its security forces from flashpoint areas of east jerusalem, and then fired a salvo of rockets at israel when the ultimatum went unheeded. israeli strikes on the gaza strip between may 10 to may 21 killed 260 palestinians including some fighters, the gaza authorities said. in israel, 13 people were killed, including a soldier, by rockets fired from gaza, the israeli police and army said. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-16,Malaysian court to rule on challenge by French-Irish teenager Nora Quoirin's family.,"kuala lumpur: a malaysian court will rule wednesday (jun 16) on a challenge by the family of a french-irish teenager over an inquest verdict that she died by misadventure after vanishing in the jungle. the body of nora quoirin, a 15-year-old with learning difficulties, was discovered after a huge hunt through the rainforest following her disappearance from a resort outside kuala lumpur in 2019. in january, a coroner handed down a ruling of misadventure, indicating her death during the family holiday was accidental rather than a crime, and said no one else was involved. but her london-based parents, who have dismissed authorities' claims their daughter wandered into the jungle alone at night, and believe she was abducted, said they were ""utterly disappointed"" by the verdict. they lodged a challenge and are seeking to have the ruling revised to an open verdict suggesting there are still questions to be answered about the case. judge azizul azmi adnan is expected to hand down his ruling at 5pm at the high court in seremban, outside kuala lumpur, via video-link because of coronavirus curbs. presenting the family's case at a hearing last week, lawyer louise azmi said an open verdict would be ""appropriate"". ""the last thing that (nora) would do is to walk away from the security of her parents,"" she said. malaysian police have stuck to their version of events that the teenager clambered out of a window of the family's holiday chalet and wandered off, and insist there was no sign of foul play. but her mother, meabh, has said she believes someone could have placed her body in the spot where it was found, not far from the resort. the teenager disappeared a day after her family checked in to the dusun resort, triggering a 10-day hunt involving hundreds of rescuers, helicopters and sniffer dogs. an autopsy concluded she likely died of starvation and internal bleeding. the coroner said the teenager had been left disoriented by the long journey from britain to malaysia, likely leading her to wander off, and that there was no sign she was murdered or sexually assaulted. the teen had a condition known as holoprosencephaly, where the brain fails to develop normally.  she had limited verbal communication and could only write a few words. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-16,New Covid cluster at Bukit Merah View Hawker Market and Food Centre formed by elderly working there.,"image from google mapsit was reported in the media today (14 jun) that a new covid-19 cluster has been formed at 115 bukit merah view market and food centre.  mandatory testing has started for all the stallholders at the hawker centre and market. a concerned bukit merah resident, mdm lim, 60, who visited the market yesterday (13 jun) told the media, ""i'm not worried about getting covid-19.  i feel fine, i don't have any symptoms, but testing would give me some assurance because my job requires me to visit clients. ""tanjong pagar grc mp joan pereira said, ""there are many elderly living in the area, and their children have also written to me as they are worried. """"i have asked them to continue monitoring their health closely and see a doctor immediately if unwell, and minimise physical interactions,"" she added.  they are also offered free testing by moh, she said. all staff and tenants who had been working at the market from may 25 have already been quarantined and will be swabbed.  the cluster now has six cases, after four cases were linked to it yesterday. moh said, ""our epidemiological investigations have found that there is likely ongoing transmission among individuals who work at the location. ""the four new cases comprise a 50-year-old man who is a conservancy worker, a 72-year-old man who works at a sundry shop, a 67-year-old woman who works as a food stall vendor, and a 65-year-old male food stall vendor. all four are close contacts of a 74-year-old man who also works at a sundry store in the market.  earlier, an 82-year-old singaporean elderly woman who works at the market has already been detected with covid-19. affected self-employed individuals can tap moh's quarantine order allowance scheme, which provides a $100 per day assistance to them. in any case, it is unfortunate to see numerous elderly still working in their twilight years to support themselves. some elderly has resorted to seeking the commissioner for the maintenance of parents (cmp) to force their children to pay up so that they can get by. the commissioner for the maintenance of parents (cmp), mr khoo oon soo, was reported to have attended to 98 seniors last year – down from 143 the year before and almost a third of the 286 in 2011. among those who sought the commissioner's help last year was a 68-year-old man.  while he had cpf savings and silver support payouts, among other things, it was insufficient for him to survive in singapore with the cost of living inching up. the commissioner located his son, who said his father did not support him when he was young.  still, the son decided to give his father $200 a month and did not resent his father for his past failings. a ministry of social and family development (msf) spokesman was quoted by straits times saying that the drop in numbers of elders seeking help is due to more of the younger seniors are ""financially able"" and better prepared for retirement through the use of their central provident fund and personal savings. but according to what toc understands in some cases, the children broke ties with the parents after being forced to pay a token sum due to the poor financial standing of the children. furthermore, according to a study from the lee kuan yew school of public policy (lkyspp), an older singaporean above 65 years old would need $1,379 a month in 2018 to meet his or her basic needs. in december 2018, there were about 268,000 cpf members aged 65 and above who received retirement payouts from either the cpf life or retirement sum scheme. according to data as of june 2020, there were 229,400 residents who are aged 65-69.  the number of cpf members who received payouts in dec 2018, seems to be rather low in comparison. what about the other 113,400 residents who are not receiving payouts? if they are not receiving any, is it because their cpf has been exhausted?similarly there were 261,000 residents aged 70-79,  however, there were only 130,000 who are receiving cpf payouts. even with the payouts, one will find it hard to meet the sum of $1,379 for their basic needs.  © 2006 2021 the online citizen© 2006 2021 the online

2021-06-16,"NUS, NTU set up S$23 million programme to test cooling solutions for data centres in the tropics.","singapore: temperatures ranging from 23 to 27 degrees celsius and ambient humidity of 50 to 60 per cent are typically the conditions needed to air-cool a data centre housing powerful computers and rows of servers. but to maintain a controlled environment like that requires plenty of energy, even more so if the data centre is set in a tropical location like singapore. to develop novel and more energy-efficient ways of cooling data centres in the tropics, a new s$23 million research programme was announced by the national university of singapore (nus) and the nanyang technological university (ntu) on wednesday (jun 16). as part of that, a testbed facility with ""state-of-the-art"" equipment will be set up at the nus kent ridge campus and will be up and running by october. the sustainable tropical data centre testbed (stdct), as it is called, will ""promote the co-creation and demonstration of advanced cooling technologies"", the universities said in a joint press release. the programme is jointly funded by the national research foundation singapore (nrf), a department under the prime minister's office, and facebook, which is the anchor industry partner. research at the stdct will be co-led by researchers from the nus, ntu and industry partners such as keppel data centres, with support from the relevant government agencies. ""companies will share their needs and requirements with the research community to ideate and innovate the solutions,"" the press release said. one area that researchers are examining is a heat sink design with both air and liquid modes of cooling in a single integrated piece that eliminates the connectors and ducts. led by nus associate professor lee poh seng, who is also the programme director at stdct, this ""direct chip hybrid cooling"" idea can be an alternative air-cooling solution during water-loop maintenance to cut down server downtime. another, led by ntu's associate professor tan rui, will test the possibility of air-cooling data centres at higher temperatures and relative humidity levels to reduce energy consumption yet ensuring the performance of the it equipment. when successfully developed and tested, a combination of the new cooling technologies being studied at the stdct could reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by ""up to 25 per cent"", compared with data centres that are traditionally air-cooled. an industry-wide adoption across the entire tropical region can also potentially cut the industry's energy usage by ""at least 40 per cent"", the press release said. ""the demonstration and validation of innovative cooling technologies at the testbed facility can greatly mitigate the operational and financial risks of adopting these solutions,"" the universities said. ""this will accelerate adoption, as well as enhance the sustainability of the data centre industry in singapore and the wider tropical region. ""in the longer term, the stdct hopes to recommend operating guidelines and set new standards based on proven findings from its new technologies to enable greener data centres. meanwhile, the facility itself will feature energy-efficient cooling solutions, such as the statepoint liquid cooling system developed by nortek air solutions and facebook that helps data centres to operate more efficiently in tropical locations. greening data centresthe rise of the digital economy has led to growing demand for data centres but the booming industry's huge energy needs are also raising concerns. the international energy agency estimates that the sector currently uses around 1 per cent of the world's electricity.  this figure could hit double-digits by 2030, making related emissions a problem. in singapore, data centres accounted for 7 per cent of the country's total electricity consumption last year.  this is projected to reach 12 per cent by 2030, the universities' press release said. with the industry being an ""intensive"" user of electricity and water, a ""temporary pause"" has since been imposed on the building of new data centres as local authorities mull a balance between environmental sustainability and supporting business needs. the government has said it is in the midst of concluding its review and intends to share its plans with the industry later this year. nrf's chief executive low teck seng said the stdct will help to accelerate the development and test-bedding of innovative and sustainable solutions for data centres towards commercial deployment. it will also support singapore's journey towards becoming a low-emissions economy as part of the foundation's energy grid 2. 0 programme, he added. the infocomm media development authority (imda), which is supporting the research programme, said it will work closely with the industry to bring about more energy-efficient data centres and encourage the adoption of best-in-class technologies, solutions and standards.

2021-06-16,More records for relentless Ronaldo! Portugal's late show leaves Hungary heartbroken in Budapest.,"hungary 0-3 portugal: match statistics  there may only have been five minutes gone, but because of the look on cristiano ronaldo's face as diogo jota took a shot instead of passing to him, it was tempting to think that it wasn't going to be the portugal captain's night. the liverpool forward stung the hands of hungary goalkeeper peter gulacsi with a decent effort from the edge of the area, but ronaldo had wanted the ball and he made his team-mate aware of his disgust in no uncertain terms. the 36-year-old cut a frustrated figure for a further 80 minutes.  at one point just before the break, he was left with his hands on his head after somehow missing the target from five yards.  by the midway point of the second half, he had been reduced to making desperate claims for a penalty. the thing about ronaldo is that even when it looks like things aren't going his way, he often ends up stealing the headlines. he said before tuesday night's euro 2020 group f clash in budapest that ""was not overwhelmed"" by the prospect of making history in his historic fifth appearance at the finals.  why would he have been? this is not a character that cracks under pressure.  he knows how to deal with disappointment.  he became the best player in the world as much for his drive and determination as his incredible footballing ability.  he does not stop.  he just keeps going. that's why he is now the european championship's all-time leading scorer, with his double in a 3-0 win over a tenacious hungary side taking him to 11 goals – two more than france legend michel platini.    ali daei's international record of 109 is now also within touching distance.  ronaldo has moved to 106 strikes for the seleccao.  no wonder he was all smiles at the end of the game. however, both he and his team-mates were in anything but a celebratory mood as the second half at puskas arena drew towards a close with the game still scoreless. portugal boast a squad packed with players who won league titles last season but it just wasn't clicking.  they looked like a group of great individuals rather than a true team, and just couldn't find a way through the home side's stubborn defence. the cauldron of sound created by a capacity crowd in budapest added to their troubles.  every portuguese touch was jeered and every successful hungarian challenge was greeted by an enormous cheer.  on paper, this was the 'easy' game in the 'group of death' for portugal.  their hosts, after all, had never beaten them, and hungary had only qualified for the euros via the nations league play-offs. yet marco rossi's side showed that they are not just here to make up the numbers.  he had said in his pre-match press conference that hungary could ""dream"" of upsetting portugal and they thought they had taken the lead when szabolcs schon fired home with just 10 minutes to go. however, the 60,000 hungary fans celebrating exuberantly were brought crashing down to earth by the realisation that the offside flag had been raised.   further disappointment would follow, as portugal's superior strength in depth finally took its toll. rossi's game plan had worked well, with hungary nullifying portugal with their deep defence.  seleccao coach fernando santos even admitted afterwards that his side had looked ""anxious"" in the second half but the introduction of rafa silva and renato sanches changed things. ""i brought rafa on and the game opened up because he is very, very fast,"" santos said after the game.  ""we wanted renato to move the ball up from midfield, we wanted to play a more vertical game and free up rafa.  i think it worked well enough because we won 3-0!""fortune smiled on the champions.  the crucial first goal came courtesy of a deflected strike from raphael guerreiro, while the second was the result of a soft penalty, which was emphatically converted by ronaldo, who had only had three touches in the hungarian box before then. however, portugal's third goal was pure class, with ronaldo starting and finishing a move in fine style, by tapping home after taking the ball coolly around gulacsi. the game had started with ronaldo screaming at a team-mate in familiar frustration.  it ended with him celebrating in his usual style.  we shouldn't have been surprised, of course.  this is what he does.  this is cristiano ronaldo, football's relentless record-breaker.

2021-06-16,Commentary: The trickiness of dealing with stray aircraft when territorial lines are grey.,"malaysia's encounter with chinese military aircraft in early june illustrates how tackling foreign aircraft coming close can be a grey area in a region of overlapping claims and different interpretations of airspaces, says mike yeo. melbourne: the news that china sent16 military aircraftto the vicinity of disputed shoals in the south china sea on the last day of may and prompted the latter to scramble fighter jets in response raised eyebrows among regional defence watchers. this new development has also understandably set off discussions in malaysia about its response to what was seen as a show of strength by the regional power. malaysia has framed the issue as one of an intrusion into malaysian airspace by multiple chinese government aircraft. the royal malaysian air force (rmaf) said in a news release on tuesday (jun 2) that 16 xian y-20 and ilyushin il-76 transport aircraft of the people's liberation army air force (plaaf) approached to within 60 nautical miles (112 km) of malaysia's coast, flying at speeds of 290 knots (537 kmh) at between 23,000 and 27,000 ft in a tactical line astern formation. malaysian foreign minister hishammuddin hussein also said his ministry will issue a diplomatic note of protest and request an explanation from the chinese ambassador from malaysia to explain the""breach of malaysian airspace and sovereignty"". the rmaf news release added that the chinese aircraft, which flew past beting patinggi ali or luconia shoals and turning back in the vicinity of nearby james shoal, did not respond when repeatedly hailed by malaysian air traffic controllers. after failing to identify the aircraft detected on radar, the rmaf scrambled its bae hawk 208 light combat jets from nearby labuan to intercept and investigate. the shoals are located off the coast of sarawak and lie inside malaysia's 200 nm (370 km) exclusive economic zone, although china also lays claim to both, which are within the ""nine-dash line"" which it uses to claim large swaths of the south china sea. china's show of strengthdespite the rmaf calling the overflight a ""serious matter that threatens national security"", there was technically nothing illegal about it. the aircraft did not intrude into malaysia's territorial airspace and were in international airspace throughout the duration. and while the large formation of aircraft did not make contact with malaysian air traffic controllers as they flew in airspace under control of the kota kinabalu flight information region (fir), there are no requirements for military aircraft to comply with civilian aviation rules when operating in international airspace under international civil aviation organization (icao) rules. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid. the plaaf aircraft were also not legally obligated to turn on their transponders that broadcast their identity and intentions.  air traffic controllers use this information to assist in managing the airspace under their control. although malaysian civil aviation authorities exercise air traffic management and administer air traffic services within its assigned fir on grounds of safety, countries do not have sovereignty over those areas. nevertheless, sending 16 military aircraft thousands of kilometres to fly over disputed shoals in the vicinity of a neighbouring country is unquestioningly an unfriendly and intended demonstration of presence and exercise in desensitisation, especially given the plaaf aircraft flew directly towards the malaysian coast before turning around. in addition to cargo, these aircraft could also transport paratroopers, trucks or armoured vehicles in an invasion scenario. this is not the first time plaaf jets have approached malaysia although this is the first time such a large aircraft force has been observed, making the recent overflight an even more noteworthy move. this is despite a spokesman for the chinese embassy in kuala lumpur calling the exercise merely ""routine flight training"".  judging from the aircraft type involved and their composition makes it likely to be a long-range airlift surge exercise to hone the plaaf's skills in undertaking large scale air transportation missions over long distances. within the same area, however, china and malaysia have had maritime standoffs near luconia shoals where chinese ships have harassed malaysian drilling rigs and supply ships in november 2020. such incidents take place as often as once a week.  while they rarely take place so close to the coast, ""this is becoming quite normal"", institute of strategic and international studies' senior foreign policy analyst shariman lockman said last year, speaking to voice of america. challenging to deal with unidentified aircraftthe incident also gives an insight into how countries deal with unidentified aircraft approaching their airspace. the rmaf said the first chinese aircraft was detected in singapore's fir (assigned by the icao and extends far into the south china sea to almost near palawan in the philippines) at 11. 53am on may 31. it added that upon crossing into the kota kinabalu fir, the unidentified aircraft were repeatedly asked to contact air traffic controllers. when no response was forthcoming, hawk 208 light combat jets from the rmaf's labuan-based 6 squadron were scrambled to investigate the radar contacts, taking off at 1. 33pm. judging from the map released by the rmaf which showed the boundary lines between firs and the speed of the chinese jets, the elapsed time between plaaf jets crossing into kota kinabalu fir and the order to scramble could have been as quick as 20 minutes, assuming rmaf planes were placed on the highest alert status. an edited audio transcript published by a malaysian aviation blog of the malaysian air traffic controllers interacting with other commercial airliners and the rmaf interceptors in the lead up to and the aftermath of the intercept suggests that two hawk 208s were involved, which is expected as fighter jets typically operate in pairs at a minimum during operational missions. however, escalating a response to the point of sending interceptors to investigate contacts is not usually required. if suspicious aircraft respond to air traffic control queries or do not appear to pose a threat to a country's territory or enter its territorial airspace, they might not be pursued further. this is also the case in singapore, with the republic of singapore air force (rsaf) saying previously that it investigates ""more than 350 suspicious air threats on any given year in order to protect singapore's skies"". this works out to an average of almost one per day.  the rsaf has on occasion also needed to scramble interceptors when the occasion demanded it, such as when bomb threats were made on commercial flights that had departed from, or bound for, singapore – like the most recentmarch 2019 caseinvolving a singapore airlines flight from mumbai. singapore's challenge is compounded by the busy airspace in and around the island and the proximity of a number of foreign airports nearby, which reduce response times when it comes to unidentified aircraft. it is a challenge for air traffic controllers to decide whether an aircraft already so close to singapore's airspace could be left alone or warrant further investigation. obviously, having to scramble fighter jets to intercept every single suspicious air contact international airspace will be an onerous task which will rapidly wear out aircraft and personnel.  in addition to radio calls which can be ignored or scrambling fighter jets, countries also have the option of asking any nearby aircraft to assist in trying to identify the suspicious aircraft. this is something japan has come to realise.  the country recently tightened its previously liberal criteria for scrambling fighter jets to intercept foreign military aircraft operating it its expansive air defence identification zone, with intercepts of what are mostly chinese and russian military aircraft dropping to 725 times in its 2020 fiscal year from 947 previously. last week's overflight is yet another reminder of what is often referred to as the ""global commons"" and the need for nations to share the use of these in transparent, responsible manner. it is however also a reminder of the security challenges confronting the region, with unresolved territorial disputes and overlapping claims never far from bubbling to the surface. mike yeo is the asia reporter for us-based defence publication defense news.

2021-06-16,China sends record 28 fighter jets toward Taiwan.,"taipei, taiwan (ap) — china flew a record 28 fighter jets toward the self-ruled island of taiwan on tuesday, the island's defense ministry said, the largest such display of force since beijing began sending planes on a near daily basis last year. taiwan's air force deployed its combat air patrol forces in response and monitored the situation in the southwestern part of the island's air defense identification zone with its air defense systems, the ministry of national defense said. the planes included various types of fighter jets including 14 j-16 and six j-11 planes, as well as bombers, the ministry said. china's show of force comes after leaders of the group of seven industrialized nations issued a statement sunday calling for a peaceful resolution of cross-taiwan strait issues and underscored the importance of peace and stability. chinese foreign ministry spokesperson zhao lijian on tuesday said the g-7 was deliberately ""interfering in china's internal affairs. """"china's determination to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests is unwavering,"" he said. taiwan and china split during a civil war in 1949, but china continues to claim taiwan as part of its territory.  taiwan has been self-ruled since then. since the election of president tsai ing-wen in 2016, china has increased diplomatic and military pressure on the government over her refusal to agree to china's insistence that the island be considered part of chinese territory. the vast majority of taiwanese reject the prospect of political union with china under the ""one country, two systems"" framework used for hong kong. since last year, china has been flying fighter jets toward the island almost daily in what it calls a demonstration of its seriousness in defending its national sovereignty. previously, the largest such maneuver was in march, when china sent 25 fighter planes toward taiwan. beijing's new top diplomat in hong kong, who called the battle against ""foreign forces"" his top priority after taking the job last month, has doubled down on that message, saying those seeking to curb china's growth or undermine its dignity

2021-06-16,"Taiwan reports largest incursion yet by Chinese air force, Asia News.","taipei, june 15 twenty-eight chinese air force aircraft, including fighters and nuclear-capable bombers, entered taiwan's air defence identification zone (adiz) on tuesday (june 15), the island's government said, the largest reported incursion to date. while there was no immediate comment from beijing, the news comes after the group of seven leaders issued a joint statement on sunday scolding china for a series of issues and underscored the importance of peace and stability across the taiwan strait, comments china condemned as ""slander"" . chinese-claimed taiwan has complained over the last few months of repeated missions by china's air force near the self-ruled island, concentrated in the southwestern part of its air defence zone near the taiwan-controlled pratas islands. the latest chinese mission involved 14 j-16 and six j-11 fighters, as well as four h-6 bombers, which can carry nuclear weapons, and anti-submarine, electronic warfare and early warning aircraft, taiwan's defence ministry said. [[nid:526703]]it was the largest daily incursion since the ministry began regularly reporting chinese air force activities in taiwan's adiz last year, breaking the previous record of 25 aircraft reported on april 12. the ministry added that taiwanese combat aircraft were dispatched to intercept and warn away the chinese aircraft, while missile systems were also deployed to monitor them. not only did the chinese aircraft fly in an area close to the pratas islands, but the bombers and some of the fighters flew around the southern part of taiwan close to the bottom tip of the island, according to a map the ministry provided. china's defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment. china has in the past described such missions as necessary to protect the country's sovereignty and deal with ""collusion"" between taipei and washington. the united states, which like most countries has no formal diplomatic ties with taiwan, has watched with alarm the stepped up tensions with beijing. [[nid:524615]]""in response to the growing prc threat, we will continue deepening our unofficial security relationship to ensure taiwan has sufficient capabilities to defend itself,"" a senior u. s.  administration official told reuters, referring to the people's republic of china. a pentagon spokesperson added that china's ""increasing military activities conducted in the vicinity of taiwan are destabilising and increase the risk of miscalculation.

""younger children tend to get excited to see their friends on the first day back at school (which could lead to them not keeping to safe distancing measures),"" she said. having one week of hbl could help them to adjust back to school without such risks, said the housewife, who has a son in primary 6 and a daughter in primary 2. but another parent, ms carmen li, 38, said hbl can be challenging and has ""added extra stress to both parent and child"". she has an intense work schedule, she said, and it has been difficult to rush her own work while giving her primary 3 daughter attention or technical support when needed. ""primary 3 children are still dependent on their parents,"" said, ms li, who works in human resources. she added that her daughter uses her phone at times to call her teacher.  ""i need to be on standby for her if she cannot get through homework.  it is almost like i need to be right next to her. ""ms li said she hopes schools can suggest a self-directed timetable for children beyond school to support parents in dealing with their children's social needs and fight boredom. mr elgin teng, 39, whose daughter is in primary 1, said he was not surprised to hear of the move, given the trend in community cases and how the end of the june holidays was approaching. said mr teng, a learning and development consultant, of his daughter: ""she gets to spend more time with the family and learn about. . .  how we make a living.  we also get to spend more time together over meals, so we see that as a good thing for her, although not so much for us parents because we now need to multitask. ""the homework load is not too heavy in primary 1, but the challenge is when the work is done and his daughter starts to seek parental attention, mr teng added. ""the school is a valuable place for every child to grow in their social awareness, relationship management and face-to-face interactions. . .  a shorter hbl might be healthier as a child's well-being needs to be extended into the space of physical interactions and also parents' space for mental rest. ""mr graham teo, 42, who has a child in secondary 1, also noted that while each singaporean has a part to play in keeping the country safe, ""an integral part of going to school is the social interaction with friends and teachers"". learning and working from home will be a part of the future, and schools are doing well under the circumstances, said mr teo, who works in procurement. ""however, with more hbl, teachers and parents need to understand that close partnership is now more crucial than ever.  both sides should reach out to each other instead of it being a one-sided effort.
