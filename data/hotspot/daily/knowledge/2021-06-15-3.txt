customers turned up in droves at the kim choo kueh chang outlet in joo chiat yesterday to buy dumplings, ahead of the dragon boat festival today.
at around noon, a snaking queue of more than a hundred people was seen going around the building where kim choo is located in.
those in the queue observed safe distancing.
the festival, also known as duan wu jie, honours the death of famous poet qu yuan, who is said to have waded into a river to commit suicide after his country's capital was captured.
villagers set out in boats to look for him and then threw dumplings into the river to prevent fish from eating his body.
some celebrations for the festival have stayed online, amid ongoing covid-19 restrictions.
the singapore federation of chinese clan associations, singapore chinese cultural centre and toa payoh central community club held an online event, involving an art contest, to mark the occasion.
meanwhile, punggol west mp sun xueling celebrated the event with about 100 senior residents over a video call.

source: alex tohsw / facebooka singaporean man, who goes by the moniker alex tohsw, encountered "a horrifying experience" on sunday (13 june) when his neighbour allegedly attacked him from behind with a bicycle chain attached to a lock pad, while he was cleaning the window panel outside his house.
he first posted about the incident on the complaint singapore facebook group, which has now garnered about 1.
9k shares and 1.
4k likes.
mr alex wrote that he was cleaning the window panel outside his house while standing on a metal ladder, when his neighbour suddenly attacked him from behind with a bicycle chain, which was attached to a lock pad.
"he claimed that i was blocking his path to go back home just because i placed his bicycle by the walkway," he noted.
mr alex also alleged that the neighbour hit him twice on the head and shoulder with the bicycle chain.
"i shouted for help as my head was bleeding profusely and i was in severe pain.
my 2 kids were in the living room and were startled to see me covered in blood," he added.
mr alex noted that his other neighbour intervened and quickly stopped the assailant from attacking him.
"my helpful neighbour lay me down as i was feeling unconscious but i was very worried for the safety of my 2 kids as the main door was unlocked.
thankfully my helpful neighbour was keeping an eye on the assailant," he noted.
following the incident, the police told mothership that a 65-year-old man has been arrested for "voluntarily causing hurt with a dangerous weapon" and it is currently under police investigation.
the police said it was alerted about the incident at 10.
26am on saturday at block 130 ang mo kio avenue 3.
"a 47-year-old man had sustained a laceration on his head, and was conscious when conveyed to the hospital," it noted.
while many netizens expressed their wishes for mr alex's speedy recovery under the comment section of his post, several facebook users seem to question the assailant's side of the story and what triggered him to assault mr alex in the first place.
however, many netizens pointed out that the neighbour should not use violence against mr alex nonetheless, as causing injury to others is wrong unless if it was for self-defence.

myanmar's junta-controlled media on monday (jun 14) accused an ethnic armed group of killing 25 construction workers in the east of the country after abducting a group of 47 people last month.
reuters was unable to reach the karen national defence organisation (kndo) for comment on the accusation.
the junta spokesman did not answer calls to seek further comment.
reuters was unable to independently verify details of the incident or the identities of those reported killed.
conflicts in myanmar's borderlands have reignited in several places since the army seized power on feb 1 and overthrew elected leader aung san suu kyi.
the global new light of myanmar newspaper and army controlled myawaddy television showed pictures of what appeared to be 25 dead bodies laid in a forest clearing.
they said the men had been working on the uhu creek bridge in the myawaddy district, near the border with thailand, and were abducted from the construction site on may 31 in a group that also included 10 children and six women.
the global new light of myanmar said a total of seven bodies were found on jun 11, one burnt and the others with hands tied behind their backs.
it said the other 18 bodies were found on jun 12.
"officials from the bridge construction site checked the dead bodies with their identities to inform parents and relatives," it said.
fighting has intensified in eastern myanmar since the coup and clashes have driven thousands of people from their homes.
the kndo, which has been fighting for greater autonomy for the karen people since 1947, is among the ethnic armed groups that have strongly opposed the military takeover.
the junta's forces have killed more than 860 people since the coup, according to the assistance association for political prisoners activist group.
the junta has said the number is much lower.

yangon: the trial of ousted myanmar leader aung san suu kyi will hear its first testimony in a junta court on monday (jun 14), more than four months after a military coup.
near daily protests have rocked myanmar since the generals' putsch removed her government in february, ending a 10-year experiment with democracy.
the mass uprising has been met with a brutal military crackdown that has killed more than 850 people, according to a local monitoring group.
the junta has brought an eclectic raft of charges against the nobel laureate, from illegally accepting 11kg of gold to breaking a colonial-era secrecy law.
on monday, her defence team will cross-examine witnesses over charges she improperly imported walkie-talkies and flouted coronavirus restrictions during last year's elections that her national league for democracy (nld) won in a landslide.
her lawyers who have been allowed to meet with her just twice since she was placed under house arrest have said they expect the trial to wrap up by jul 26. hearings for the case will take place every monday.
if convicted of all charges, aung san suu kyi, 75, faces more than a decade in jail.
"we are hoping for the best but prepared for the worst," khin maung zaw, one of suu kyi's lawyers, told afp ahead of the hearing in the capital naypyidaw.
a separate case is scheduled to start on jun 15, where she is charged with sedition alongside ousted president win myint and another senior member of the nld.
cloistered iconaung san suu kyi spent more than 15 years under house arrest during the previous junta's rule before her 2010 release.
her international stature diminished following a wave of military violence targeting buddhist-majority myanmar's marginalised muslim rohingya community, but the coup has returned aung san suu kyi to the role of cloistered democracy icon.
on thursday, she was hit with additional corruption charges of illegally accepting us$600,000 in cash and around 11kg of gold.
her lawyer khin maung zaw dismissed the new charges which could see aung san suu kyi hit with another lengthy prison term as "absurd".
"there is an undeniable political background to keep her out of the scene of the country and to smear her prestige," he told afp last week.
"that's one of the reasons to charge her to keep her out of the scene.
"myanmar has plunged into a "human rights catastrophe" since the coup, the un rights chief michelle bachelet said on friday, adding that the military leadership was "singularly responsible" for the crisis.
bachelet also slammed the sweeping arrests in the country of activists, journalists and opponents of the regime, citing credible sources saying at least 4,804 people remain in arbitrary detention.
junta leader min aung hlaing has justified his power grab by citing alleged electoral fraud in the november poll won by suu kyi's nld.
the junta has previously said it would hold fresh elections within two years, but has also threatened to dissolve the nld.

he had left home on the morning of june 18, 1991, and walked to his car like on any other day, only to find it coated with a film of light grey powder.
"what a nuisance, i first thought, and wiped it away as best as i could," recounted associate professor simon tay, 60, chairman of the singapore institute of international affairs.
he thought it was dust the wind had blown from a nearby construction site, but soon learnt that the impossible had happened.
fine ash from a volcano more than 2,400km across the sea in the philippines had been blown to singapore, blanketing the ground, cars and even the floors of houses islandwide with a layer of ash.
over at the weather observation point at changi airport, mr mah king kheong, then an operational meteorologist for meteorological service singapore (mss), saw a fine layer of whitish-grey "dust" on the ground and side railings.
"the ash in the atmosphere was quite fine, like what we observe on a hazy day," recalled mr mah, 56, who is now a principal meteorologist at mss.
the 24-hour pollutant standards index was in the "moderate" range, between 57 and 70, from june 17 to 19, he said.
after more than 500 years in deep slumber, mount pinatubo on luzon island awakened with a vengeance, rocking the planet with a series of eruptions in mid-june 1991.  the biggest explosion on june 15 blew ash to singapore on the evening of june 17. mr mah said mss received calls from the public, asking about the cause of the ash.
the straits times' newsline also received more than 50 calls.
it took about three weeks for the amount of dust in the air to return to normal.
water quality here was unaffected.
on june 17 and 18, several members of the public complained about sneezing and coughing more than usual, while others complained of itchy skin, reported st. while people were inconvenienced by having to wash their clothes and cars again, car wash facilities had a windfall.
"the tv coverage of the mount pinatubo eruption was stark and disturbing not only the eruption itself, but also the heavy rain and surging mudflows that destroyed so much in their path," prof tay recalled.
as the assistant director of the singapore international foundation then, he sent a small team of medical volunteers to the philippines to help.
"we are glad to be safe (in singapore), spared from hardships, but should we be inured to disasters?

singapore: an 85-year-old man was fined s$5,000 and banned from driving for a year on monday (jun 14) for colliding with a motorcyclist, leaving him with a fractured leg and dislocated toe.
khoo tea wah, who appeared in court with a walking stick, pleaded guilty to one count of causing grievous hurt by a negligent act.
he admitted to failing to give way to the 29-year-old motorcyclist while he was driving his car out from a car park at block 40, bedok south road.
the incident happened at about 11.
30am on sep 25, 2019. the court heard that khoo's wife was in the front passenger seat as he exited the car park gantry and stopped to check for oncoming vehicles.
he wanted to make a right turn into bedok south road towards bedok south avenue 1.  khoo saw the victim's motorcycle approaching in the first lane, furthest away from him, but still proceeded to make the turn even though the victim had the right of way.
khoo drove across the third and second lanes of the road.
just as he was about to enter the motorcyclist's lane, his wife said "motorbike, motorbike", asking him to stop.
however, khoo continued to drive forward and stopped only after his wife said "motorbike" a third time.
it was too late at this point and his vehicle collided into the motorcyclist.
the victim was flung off the bike and landed on his back three to four metres away.
he was taken to hospital with injuries including a knee wound, a fractured femur and a dislocated toe.
he was warded for 25 days, given more than a year's hospitalisation leave and underwent multiple surgical procedures for his wrist and thigh.
he still has follow-up appointments for his wrist injury, which he sustained on his dominant hand, and is unable to carry heavy items with it.
the prosecutor asked for the sentence that was meted out, which included the maximum fine possible.
however, she noted khoo's lack of prior convictions, his plea of guilt and his advanced age.
he had also stopped to help the victim, she said.
in mitigation, khoo pleaded for leniency.
"i have been driving for a long time and have always maintained a clean driving record," he said through an interpreter.
"i know i did wrong, and i plead guilty.
please impose a light sentence on account that i'm already advanced in age.
"he could have jailed up to two years, fined up to s$5,000, or both for causing grievous hurt by a negligent act.

yangon • the trial of deposed myanmar leader aung san suu kyi started yesterday, more than four months after a military coup, with junta witnesses testifying that the nobel peace laureate flouted coronavirus restrictions and illegally imported walkie-talkies.
near daily protests have rocked myanmar since the feb 1 coup.
the mass uprising has been met with a brutal military crackdown that has killed more than 850 civilians, said a local monitoring group.
the junta has brought an eclectic raft of charges against ms suu kyi, including claims that she accepted illegal payments of gold and violated a colonial-era secrecy law.
the court yesterday heard a major from the police force testify that ms suu kyi, 75, broke coronavirus restrictions during last year's elections that her national league for democracy (nld) party won in a landslide, her lawyer min min soe told afp.
another police major testified on separate charges accusing her of illegally importing and possessing walkie-talkies, she added.
ms suu kyi "paid keen attention" throughout the hearing, another member of her legal team, khin maung zaw said in a statement.
journalists were barred from the proceedings in the special court in the capital naypyitaw, but an afp reporter said there was a heavy police presence outside.
ms suu kyi's lawyers who have struggled to gain access to their client have said they expect the trial to wrap up by july 26.

a separate trial is scheduled to start today over sedition charges she faces alongside ousted president win myint and another senior member of the nld.

last thursday, she was hit with additional corruption charges over claims that she illegally accepted us$600,000 (s$796,000) in cash and around 11kg of gold.
her lawyer khin maung zaw has dismissed the new charges which could see ms suu kyi hit with another lengthy prison term as "absurd".

singapore a former part-time taxi driver was sentenced on monday (june 14) to 13 months' jail for molesting a female passenger in 2019. in april this year, district judge john ng convicted haji mohamed yusoof a.  p.  m.  adam, now 56, of one count of molestation following a trial.
the 30-year-old victim cannot be named due to a gag order to protect her identity.
lawyer raphael louis, who represents yusoof, earlier told the straits times that his client is a truck driver who was a part-time taxi driver at the time of the offence.
he added that yusoof is no longer holding that part-time job.
during the trial, the court heard that after a drinking session with friends, the woman boarded the taxi on jan 5, 2019, before she fell asleep in the rear seat.
deputy public prosecutor (dpp) benedict chan stated in his submissions that yusoof molested the victim after the taxi arrived at a carpark in lorong ah soo near upper paya lebar road at around 5.
20am.
the dpp added that the woman woke up and shouted at yusoof after feeling his hands on her body.
yusoof then returned to the driver's seat and dropped her off at her intended destination a short distance away, said dpp chan.
the woman later lodged a police report, the court heard.
yusoof claimed that he did not touch the victim, saying he tried to wake her up by calling out to her after the taxi reached the carpark.
he also stated that he later alighted from the vehicle, opened the rear passenger door and called out to her again.
she then woke up, he claimed.
in delivering his verdict in april, judge ng noted that yusoof and the woman had given different accounts of the incident.
there were also no other witnesses present.
the judge found the woman to be a truthful witness and that her evidence was cogent and reliable.
he, however, found that yusoof was evasive.
on monday, the court heard that yusoof intends to appeal against his conviction and sentence.
his bail has been set at $10,000.
offenders convicted of molestation can be jailed for up to two years and fined or caned.
yusoof cannot be caned because he is over 50 years old.

when spice shop owner jeya seelan saw security camera footage of a man stealing $800 from the till, he decided that he was not going to tarnish the culprit's reputation.
that was why he used a blurry photo that obscured the man's face when he posted on his facebook account asking the thief to return the money, even though he was upset and angry.
in a phone interview with the straits times, mr jeya said: "it was just heartbreaking and shocking.
if you think about all the hard work that went into earning that money, and one guy suddenly comes in to steal it in a flash, it is devastating.
"mr jeya also opted not to make a police report for the same reason to avoid harming the man's reputation.
the decision was not a popular one.
he said: "i was under a lot of pressure.
many people, including my wife, said making a police report was the right thing to do.
people on facebook asked me to report him as well.
they said a leopard can never change its spots.
"but times are tough for everybody and some people could have lost their jobs.
everyone is fighting their own battles.
"mr jeya, 31, is the owner of jeya spices at block 294 yishun street 22.  he also has a stall at the fairprice xtra supermarket at parkway parade.
the theft took place at the yishun shop at about noon on june 3.  at the time, two of mr jeya's employees were looking after the shop while he was away on course.
one of them had gone to the toilet and the other was attending to a customer.
that was when a man walked by and swiped about $800 from a plastic box where the money was kept.
the shop sells custom-made spice blends and condiments, and mr jeya said he started working there in 2014 two months after graduating from nanyang technological university's wee kim wee school of communication and information.
he was initially indifferent to joining the business, which was started by his grandfather 60 years ago.
but when his father asked him if he wanted to work there, he said yes.
"i was just sitting idle at home so i thought, why not give it a go?
"the first two days of work were tough, he said, but soon, he was hooked.
he was drawn in particular to custom-blended spices, which are slowly falling out of favour.
mr jeya is keen to revive their popularity.
mr jeya, who has no children, lives in ang mo kio with his wife, who works as a relationship manager in standard chartered bank.
yishun is close to mr jeya's heart, and he thinks of his customers there as family.
that was one reason he was not keen to go to the police when he discovered the theft, choosing instead to rely on facebook to get the thief to return the money.
he said: "yishun is a close-knit community where everybody knows each other.
a lot of my friends and customers in the neighbourhood helped by sharing the facebook post.
they were also angry and gave me emotional support.
"the day after the theft, on june 4, a friend of the man who took the money sent mr jeya a text message at about 6pm.
the next day, he came with the thief to return the money.
mr jeya said: "we like to say 'bila bila yishun', which means 'yishun forever' in malay.
we have a spirit of helping one another.
people say the kampung spirit is dying, but i do not believe that is true.

singapore: a man was jailed for 10 months on monday (jun 14) for paying for a sex act with a 17-year-old boy, after tricking the boy into believing he was a "sugar mummy".
muhammad al-masfuiin mushin, 26, pleaded guilty to one charge of commercial sex with a minor.
the court heard that the victim began using an application called locanto in 2017.  he discovered that there were advertisements for sexual services, and users looking for "sugar mummies" or "friends with benefits".
"sugar mummy" is a term for older women who pay younger individuals for companionship that may be of a sexual nature.
the victim wanted to earn money by offering sexual services and created an account.
on jun 16, 2019, the victim was kicked out of his house after a heated argument with his mother.
as he needed money, he put up an ad seeking a sugar mummy, titling it "toyboy fantasy satisfies you 18".
he included his phone number and two photos of himself in the ad, offering sexual services in exchange for money.
the accused saw the ad a day later.
even though the victim was searching for a sugar mummy, muhammad al-masfuiin decided to pose as a woman and chat with the victim.
he began chatting with the boy on telegram, saying: "i'm looking for a young boy to be my sex slave.
"he asked the victim for photos and body statistics of himself, and told him he was female.
when muhammad al-masfuiin asked the victim for his real age, the victim replied that he was 17, had been chased out of his house and needed money.
posing as a woman, muhammad al-masfuiin asked the victim "would you have sex with my (boyfriend) and i", despite knowing there would be no woman involved.
the victim agreed and asked for s$250 per meet-up.
muhammad al-masfuiin told the victim that he could stay over, but he would have to perform sex acts on the fictitious "boyfriend".
at 1am on jun 18, 2019, muhammad al-masfuiin booked a taxi for the victim to go to muhammad al-masfuiin's house.
believing that the buyer was a woman, the victim asked if "she" would be joining the sex session.
muhammad al-masfuiin replied that she "might not", but the boyfriend "will tell me if you did a great job at sex".
the victim asked muhammad al-masfuiin if he knew the victim was 17, and muhammad al-masfuiin replied "yes", adding: "i like my boys young".
the victim got to muhammad al-masfuiin's home.
he took a shower on muhammad al-masfuiin's instruction and came out of the bathroom to see muhammad al-masfuiin performing a sex act.
muhammad al-masfuiin then performed a sex act on the victim before asking him for sex.
the victim resisted, but muhammad al-masfuiin was of a bigger build than him.
before muhammad al-masfuiin could initiate sex, he ejaculated.
the victim got dressed and went to sleep and texted the accused's number, thinking it belonged to a woman, telling "her" that the sex session was completed.
the next morning, the victim woke up and asked muhammad al-masfuiin for money to get to work.
muhammad al-masfuiin gave him s$50 and the victim left.
later that day, a police officer on foot patrol in toa payoh came across the victim.
in the course of investigations, he found messages in the victim's phone pertaining to the provision of sexual services.
court documents did not specify why the victim was stopped by police.
muhammad al-masfuiin was identified and arrested for commercial sex with a minor under 18. he could have been jailed up to seven years, fined, or both.

detained politician faces a string of charges, including accepting illegal payments and violating colonial-era law.
the trial of deposed myanmar leader aung san suu kyi began on monday, more than four months after the military seized power in a coup.
the military regime has brought an eclectic mix of charges against aung san suu kyi, who was returned to office after her national league for democracy won a landslide victory in elections last november, including claims she accepted illegal payments of gold and violated a colonial-era secrecy law.
a special court in naypyidaw, the capital, heard a police major testify that the 75-year-old broke coronavirus restrictions while campaigning during the polls, while another testified on separate charges accusing her of illegally importing and possessing walkie-talkies, her lawyer min min soe told afp news agency.
aung san suu kyi was hit with additional corruption charges last week over claims she illegally accepted $600,000 in cash and approximately 11kg (24.
2 pounds) of gold.
journalists were barred from proceedings in court, and an afp reporter said there was a heavy police presence outside.
aung san suu kyi's lawyers, who have struggled to gain access to their client, say they expect the trial to wrap up by july 26. a separate trial is scheduled to start on tuesday over sedition charges she faces alongside overthrown president win myint and another senior member of the nld.
if convicted of all charges, aung san suu kyi faces more than a decade in jail.
"it is a show trial motivated only by political reasons," said debbie stothard, coordinator of the alternative asean network on burma.
"min aung hlaing [military chief] is determined to lock up aung san suu kyi for the rest of her life.
if he could, he would probably charge her under every law available.
"human rights watch said the allegations were "bogus and politically motivated" with the intention of nullifying the nld victory and preventing aung san suu kyi from running for office again.
"this trial is clearly the opening salvo in an overall strategy to neuter suu kyi and the national league for democracy party as a force that can challenge military rule in the future," said deputy asia director phil robertson.
near-daily protests have rocked myanmar since the generals' february 1 putsch.
a mass uprising has been met with a brutal military crackdown that has killed more than 850 civilians, according to a local monitoring group.
analysts say army chief min aung hlaing determined to sideline hugely popular leader and reshape political landscape.
military attacks have forced villagers into the jungle and stiffened the resolve of those fighting against the coup.
protesters demand firmer action against military leaders' february power grab and recognition of civilian government.
men in embattled town of mindat flee to the hills as military steps up crackdown on resistance to february 1 coup.

                singapore (the straits times/ann): a man posed as a woman online to lure a 17-year-old boy into having commercial sex with him.
muhammad al-masfuiin muhsin, now 26, had pretended to be a woman who was looking for a "sex slave" to provide sexual services for "herself" and her "boyfriend" in exchange for s$250.
on june 18, 2019, the teenager, who had been kicked out of his home earlier, arrived at a tampines flat.
al-masfuiin, posing as the boyfriend, then performed a sexual act on the boy in exchange for a night's lodging in the unit.
he also gave the boy a $50 note.
the singaporean, who was aware of the teenager's age, was sentenced on monday (june 14) to 10 months' jail after admitting that he had indulged in commercial sex with a minor below 18 years old.
the victim cannot be named due to a gag order to protect his identity.
deputy public prosecutor emily koh said that some time in 2017, the boy started using online classifieds website locanto and discovered advertisements for sexual services as well as posts by people looking for "sugar mummies" or "friends with benefits".
a sugar mummy commonly refers to an older woman who is willing to pay for the company of a younger person.
he created an account on locanto as he wanted to earn money by offering sexual services.
the teenager was kicked out of his home on june 16, 2019, after a heated argument with his mother.
in need of money, he created an advertisement on locanto titled "toyboy fantasy", stating he was looking for a "sugar mummy" and was willing to provide sexual services.
al-masfuiin, who came across the advertisement, posed as a woman and chatted with the boy via messaging platform telegram.
the dpp said: "the accused was aware that the victim had no place to stay and offered lodging to the victim.
still posing as a female, the accused told the victim that he could stay at 'her boyfriend's place' and that 'he'll send a grab to let you stay over'.
"believing that the accused was a female, the victim asked if the accused was joining the sex session.
the accused, still posing as a female, replied that 'she' 'might not', 'but my (boyfriend) will tell me if you did a great job at sex'.
"the teenager arrived at the tampines flat at around 1.
20am on june 18 and al-masfuiin performed oral sex on him.
the boy later fell asleep in the unit and al-masfuiin gave him the $50 note after he woke up that morning.
the pair then parted ways.
a police officer was patrolling in toa payoh later that day when he spotted the teenager.
he looked through the youngster's mobile phone and found out the minor had been providing sexual services.
al-masfuiin was arrested soon after.
for having commercial sex with a minor below 18 years old, an offender can be jailed for up to seven years and fined.

when spice shop owner jeya seelan saw security camera footage of a man stealing $800 from the till, he decided that he was not going to tarnish the culprit's reputation.
that is why he used a blurry photo that obscured the man's face when he posted on his facebook account asking the thief to return the money, even though he was upset and angry.
in a phone interview with the straits times, mr jeya said: "it was just heartbreaking and shocking.
if you think about all the hard work that went into earning that money, and one guy suddenly comes in to steal it in a flash, it's devastating.
"mr jeya also opted not to make a police report for the same reason to avoid harming the man's reputation.
the decision was not a popular one.
he said: "i was under a lot of pressure.
many people, including my wife, said making a police report was the right thing to do.
people on facebook asked me to report him as well.
they said a leopard can never change its spots.
"but times are tough for everybody, and some people could have lost their jobs.
everyone is fighting their own battles.
"mr jeya, 31, is the owner of jeya spices at block 294, yishun street 22.  he also has a stall at the fairprice xtra supermarket in parkway parade.
the theft took place at the yishun shop at about noon on june 3.  at the time, two of mr jeya's employees were looking after the shop while he was away on course.
one of them had gone to the toilet and the other was attending to a customer.
that was when a man walked by and swiped about $800 from a plastic box where the money was kept.
this is not the first time someone has stolen money from the shop till.
about three years ago, a man who worked part-time at the shop stole about $40.
since it was a small sum, mr jeya let the matter go, but he installed a closed-circuit television camera.
the shop sells custom-made spice blends and condiments, and mr jeya said he started working there in 2014 two months after graduating from nanyang technological university's wee kim wee school of communication and information.
he was initially indifferent to joining the business, which was started by mr jeya's grandfather 60 years ago.
when his father asked him if he wanted to work there, he said yes.
"i was just sitting idle at home so i thought, why not give it a go?
"the first two days of work were tough, he said, but soon, he was hooked.
he was drawn in particular to custom-blended spices, which are slowly falling out of favour.
mr jeya is keen to revive their popularity.
mr jeya, who has no children, lives in ang mo kio with his wife, who works as a relationship manager in standard chartered bank.
yishun is close to mr jeya's heart, and he thinks of his customers there as family.
that was one reason he was not keen to go to the police when he discovered the theft, choosing instead to rely on facebook to get the thief to return the money.
he said: "yishun is a close-knit community where everybody knows each other.
a lot of my friends and customers in the neighbourhood helped by sharing the facebook post.
they were also angry and gave me emotional support.
"the day after the theft, on june 4, a friend of the man who took the money sent mr jeya a text message at about 6pm.
the next day, he came with the thief to return the money.
mr jeya said: "we like to say 'bila bila yishun', which means 'yishun forever' in malay.
we have a spirit of helping one another.
people say the kampung spirit is dying but i don't believe that's true.

the former head of myanmar's covid-19 immunisation programme has been arrested and faces charges of high treason for colluding with opponents of the military authorities, state media reported on monday (jun 14).
myanmar's healthcare system and coronavirus prevention measures have collapsed since the army seized power on feb 1 and overthrew elected leader aung san suu kyi, whose government had successfully stopped two waves of the virus.
on sunday, reported cases surged to their highest since shortly after the coup.
doctors and other medical workers have been at the forefront of a civil disobedience movement (cdm), leading strikes that have paralysed official and private business.
dozens have been arrested and hundreds more are wanted.
the global new light of myanmar said htar htar lin had been arrested on jun 10 and she was also accused of working with an underground national unity government (nug).
"according to her confession, she not only joined the cdm and formed the cdm core group together with other cdm doctors and staff but also colluded with terrorist nug," it said.
reuters was unable to reach her or any lawyer representing her for comment.
the paper said she and 11 other doctors would face charges that included high treason, incitement and colluding with an illegal organisation.
the junta has branded the nug set up by supporters of suu kyi and other opponents of military rule as a terrorist group.
the arrest of htar htar lin and other doctors was condemned by us-based physicians for human rights.
"dr htar htar lin's arbitrary arrest is yet another sign that the military junta will stop at nothing in its war against myanmar's health workers," said jennifer leigh, an epidemiologist serving as the group's myanmar researcher.
the 373 new cases of covid-19 reported on sunday was the highest since feb 3, just before testing collapsed in the wake of the coup.

singapore a man posed as a woman online to lure a 17-year-old boy into having commercial sex with him.
muhammad al-masfuiin muhsin, now 26, had pretended to be a woman who was looking for a "sex slave" to provide sexual services for "herself" and her "boyfriend" in exchange for $250.
on june 18, 2019, the teenager, who had been kicked out of his home earlier, arrived at a tampines flat.
al-masfuiin, posing as the boyfriend, then performed a sexual act on the boy in exchange for a night's lodging in the unit.
he also gave the boy a $50 note.
the singaporean, who was aware of the teenager's age, was sentenced on monday (june 14) to 10 months' jail after admitting that he had indulged in commercial sex with a minor below 18 years old.
the victim cannot be named due to a gag order to protect his identity.
deputy public prosecutor emily koh said that some time in 2017, the boy started using online classifieds website locanto and discovered advertisements for sexual services as well as posts by people looking for "sugar mummies" or "friends with benefits".
a sugar mummy commonly refers to an older woman who is willing to pay for the company of a younger person.
he created an account on locanto as he wanted to earn money by offering sexual services.
the teenager was kicked out of his home on june 16, 2019, after a heated argument with his mother.
in need of money, he created an advertisement on locanto titled "toyboy fantasy", stating he was looking for a "sugar mummy" and was willing to provide sexual services.
al-masfuiin, who came across the advertisement, posed as a woman and chatted with the boy via messaging platform telegram.
the dpp said: "the accused was aware that the victim had no place to stay and offered lodging to the victim.
still posing as a female, the accused told the victim that he could stay at 'her boyfriend's place' and that 'he'll send a grab to let you stay over'.
"believing that the accused was a female, the victim asked if the accused was joining the sex session.
the accused, still posing as a female, replied that 'she' 'might not', 'but my (boyfriend) will tell me if you did a great job at sex'.
"the teenager arrived at the tampines flat at around 1.
20am on june 18 and al-masfuiin performed oral sex on him.
the boy later fell asleep in the unit and al-masfuiin gave him the $50 note after he woke up that morning.
the pair then parted ways.
a police officer was patrolling in toa payoh later that day when he spotted the teenager.
he looked through the youngster's mobile phone and found out the minor had been providing sexual services.
al-masfuiin was arrested soon after.
for having commercial sex with a minor below 18 years old, an offender can be jailed for up to seven years and fined.

manila: philippine troops killed four abu sayyaf militants in a gun battle on sunday (jun 13) in the country's south, including a commander blamed for beheadings and a suspected would-be suicide bomber, military officials said.
army troops backed by police were to serve a warrant for the arrest of injam yadah at his home after midnight in alat village in jolo town in sulu province, when he and his men opened fire.
that sparked the gun battle that killed the militants, said regional military commander lieutenant general corleto vinluan jr. yadah had been accused by the military of involvement in the kidnappings for ransom of filipinos and foreigners, including eight indonesian fishermen who were abducted at sea off malaysia in early 2020 and brought to the southern philippines.
three of the indonesians were freed, one was shot and killed while attempting to escape and four were rescued by filipino troops in march.
"he had a reputation for being extremely violent, beheading captured innocent civilians and security forces alike," a military commander, major general william gonzales, said of yadah.
yadah had also been linked to the 2015 kidnappings of four people, including two canadian tourists.
the canadians were separately beheaded by their abu sayyaf captors, including mujir yadah, a brother of injam, after a deadline for ransom payment lapsed, a military officer said.
another abu sayyaf militant killed in sunday's firefight was al sawadjaan, a bomb-maker and would-be suicide bomber, according to lieutenant colonel wilfredo borgonia, an army infantry battalion commander.
troops seized a rifle, a pistol, bomb parts and 15 cellphones.
they also took into custody yadah's wife and three children, the military said in a statement, adding the children were "rescued".
sawadjaan was a younger brother of abu sayyaf commander mundi sawadjaan, the main suspect in a number of deadly suicide attacks in recent years in sulu, a predominantly muslim province where the militants have been the target of years-long military offensives.
the sawadjaans belonged to an abu sayyaf faction that has pledged allegiance to the islamic state group.
this year, at least 18 abu sayyaf militants have been killed, 17 captured while 86 others have surrendered in sulu, the military said.
the us and the philippines have separately blacklisted the abu sayyaf as a terrorist organisation for deadly bombings, ransom kidnappings and beheadings.
the brutal group has been considerably weakened by battle setbacks, surrenders and factionalism but remains a national security threat.

houston — houston police are investigating after a new rolls-royce was found shot up and left with doors wide open on the side of the east freeway sunday morning.
this strange scene unfolded at about 2:15 a. m.  on the westbound lanes of the freeway near san jacinto.
officers were the ones who found the high-end car parked along the side of the freeway, according to investigators.

the car was towed off the freeway and that's when investigators said they found blood inside the car, and they also found shell casings, indicating that shots were fired from the vehicle and that it may have been involved in some sort of shootout.
moments later, investigators were notified that two people who may have been inside the rolls-royce showed up to the hospital with injuries from cut glass and the airbags exploding.

hong kong: hong kong police arrested at least three protesters on saturday (jun 12), the anniversary of protests in 2019 that rocked the financial hub and eventually led to beijing introducing a security law that critics say has stifled dissent.
the protesters were arrested for disorderly conduct and failing to produce proof of identity, while at least 10 people were summoned for violating a ban on gatherings, police said, after protests in the kowloon district of mongkok.
some people blocked roads by placing rubbish bins and other objects on them, police said.
"the police strongly condemn .
.
.
acts endangering public health and safety," police said in a post on facebook shortly before midnight on saturday.
the three people arrested were teenagers, aged 15 to 19, police said.
small groups gathered on saturday to commemorate the first major clashes between protesters and police two years ago when tens of thousands demonstrated against a proposed law for the former british colony that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to the mainland for trial.
many hong kong residents saw the proposed law as further erosion of the city's special status that was supposed to be guaranteed under a "one country, two systems" formula agreed when britain handed it over to china in 1997. the 2019 protests snowballed over subsequent months into a mass movement for democracy that included regular clashes between protesters and police firing tear gas and rubber bullets.
police deployed 2,000 officers around the city on saturday, the south china morning post reported.
police said on the eve of the anniversary that they had arrested two people on suspicion of promoting and inciting others to join an unlawful assembly.
activist group student politicism said two of its leaders were arrested.
there was no sign of any protests on sunday.

beijing: at least 12 people were killed and nearly 140 others injured when a gas line explosion ripped through a residential compound in central china's hubei province on sunday (jun 13), local officials said.
rescue efforts were continuing, according to a statement from the disaster management bureau in the city of shiyan, although it was unclear how many people may still be trapped under the debris.
the explosion took place at about 6.
30am and an investigation was under way to determine the cause of the blast, the statement said.
responders sent 138 people to hospital, of which 37 were critically injured, according to a statement on the city's official website.
videos shot by witnesses and verified by beijing news show several buildings reduced to rubble and rescue workers carrying shocked survivors on stretchers.
the blast ripped through one of the city's vegetable markets that was filled with shoppers and local residents eating breakfast, an eyewitness told state-run global times.
"i heard a loud bang and immediately ducked under the table, thinking it was an earthquake," a man who owns a small restaurant near the explosion site told the newspaper.
state broadcaster cctv showed footage of buildings with charred walls and shattered windows.
rescuers are seen raking through the debris with shovels and gloved hands.
people can be seen walking in a rubble-strewn street between damaged buildings.
images also show rescuers climbing over broken concrete slabs to reach those trapped inside.
the blast occurred in a two-storey building that earlier housed a vehicle frame manufacturer.
several survivors told local media that the gas pipeline had fallen into disrepair after the factory was moved last year.
"in march, workers from the gas company came and asked whether i got a smell of gas," one survivor who runs a stall in the market told local website health times.
"after asking around (with) people they just left.
"around 900 residents in the area have been evacuated as surrounding buildings may have been damaged by the blast, the city government said.
about 2,000 rescue workers have been deployed on the site.
images verified by health times show a firefighter who was also injured and a fire truck damaged by a second, smaller blast.
the severely injured were airlifted to bigger hospitals.
long lines of volunteers were seen outside blood banks as local hospitals put out a call for donors.
the ministry of emergency management has also sent a team to assist with the rescue operation.
in a rare move, chinese president xi jinping issued a statement urging local officials to "learn profound lessons from the incident" and double down on efforts to prevent such incidents.
"all regions and relevant departments must draw lessons from one another .
.
.
investigate various safety hazards and prevent major emergencies," he said.
industrial accidents are common in china due to weak safety standards and corruption among officials tasked with enforcing them.
the blast came a day after eight people were killed and three others injured when toxic methyl formate leaked from a chemical handling facility in the southwestern city of guiyang.
among the worst accidents was a massive 2015 explosion at a chemical warehouse in the port city of tianjin that killed 173 people, most of them firefighters and police officers.
the blast was blamed on illegal construction and unsafe storage of volatile materials.

singapore a man was found dead at the building site of an upcoming warehouse on thursday (june 10) after falling some 40m, the equivalent of 14 floors of a housing block.
the 25-year-old bangladeshi was working on the building of a stairwell at the site, and was crossing the gap between the stairwell's walls when a structure used to bridge the gap gave way, causing him to plunge to his death, a spokesman for the ministry of manpower (mom) said on saturday.
in response to queries from the straits times, the police said they received a call alerting them to the incident at 20 tuas south avenue 14 at 5.
30pm on thursday.
when paramedics from the singapore civil defence force arrived, they said the man was dead.
the authorities are investigating but no foul play is suspected, the police said.
the construction site is where the logos tuas logistics hub is being built.
when complete, it will have one two-storey warehouse and another four-storey one.
the complex spans an area nearly six times the size of the padang.
the first phase of construction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of this year.
according to the firm's website, the building will have an approved dangerous goods storage space on the first floor.
a logos spokesman confirmed that the man who died was an employee of one of its contractors.
"logos is currently investigating the details of the incident and is working closely with the general contractor and cooperating with the local authorities," she said.
"safety is logos' no.
1 priority and our thoughts are with the family.
"the mom spokesman told st that the occupier of the site is hpc builders, and the man was employed by bhd construction.
the mom is investigating the incident, and has instructed hpc to stop work on the stairwells.
there were 14 workplace deaths between january and april this year, including three from a fatal industrial blast in tuas in february.

singapore: two men will be charged in court on friday (jun 11) for their suspected involvement in a series of china officials impersonation scams.
the men, aged 46 and 48, are accused of collecting money from victims of the scam and are believed to have received commission for their involvement, said the singapore police force (spf) on thursday.
the police said they received reports from five victims between jul 18 and 29 last year.
"phone scammers claiming to be from the 'chinese police' had accused the victims of being involved in transnational money-laundering crimes," said spf.
"the victims were believed to have been subsequently misled into handing cash totalling s$1,580,000 to various persons in singapore to prove that their money was not derived from illegal activities.
"police investigations revealed that the two men became involved in the scam after responding to a job listing on facebook which promised s$300 for courier work.
"after being added to a whatsapp chat group and following the instructions by the group's organisers, the duo allegedly began collecting money amounting to s$230,000 from three out of the five victims," spf said.
"the collections were then purportedly handed over to unknown persons.
"both men allegedly received a total of s$15,700 as commission but they have since surrendered the amount during investigations, said the police.
they will be charged for assisting another to retain benefits from criminal conduct under the corruption, drug trafficking and other serious offences (confiscation of benefits) act.
if convicted, they face up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to s$500,000, or both.
the police advised members of the public to ignore unsolicited calls asking for money to be handed over in relation to supposed criminal investigations.
they also warned against giving out personal information and bank details.
"no local government agency will demand payment through a phone call or other social messaging platforms, demand that you hand over cash to strangers or ask you for your personal banking information such as your internet banking passwords," spf said.
"for foreign residents receiving calls from persons claiming to be police officers or government officials from your home country, please call your embassy/high commission to verify the claims of the caller.
"the police also warned members of the public not to collect money from other individuals on behalf of strangers, especially if they claim to be law enforcement officers.

singapore two men will be charged in court on friday (june 11) for their alleged roles in a series of scams that cheated their victims of almost $1.
6 million.
the scams involved people calling and posing as police officers from china, said the singapore police force on thursday.
between july 18 and july 29, 2020, the commercial affairs department received reports from five victims who had fallen prey to scammers pretending to be chinese officials.
phone scammers claiming to be the chinese police had accused the victims of being involved in transnational money-laundering crimes.
the victims were believed to have been subsequently misled into handing over cash totalling $1,580,000 to various people in singapore to prove that their money was not derived from illegal activities.
the men, aged 46 and 48, are alleged to have been involved in the ruse as couriers, and received a combined $15,700 as commission.
they are suspected of collecting $230,000 from three victims, which they handed over to unidentified people.
the men got involved after responding to a job listing on facebook promising $300 for courier work.
they were then added into a whatsapp chat where they received instructions to collect money from the victims.
they surrendered their commission money over to the police during investigations.
the pair were caught after the police received reports from the victims.
the duo will be charged with assisting another to retain benefits from criminal conduct, which carries a penalty of 10 years in jail and/or a fine of up to $500,000.
the police advise members of the public to take the following precautions when they receive unsolicited calls asking them to part with their money:1.  ignore the calls and the caller's instructions.
2.  understand that no local government agency will demand payment through a phone call or social messaging platforms, or demand that they hand over cash to strangers, or ask for personal banking information.
3.  if they are not singaporean, check with their embassy or high commission to verify the call.
4.  call a friend or relative before making any decisions.
"do not be pressured by the caller to act impulsively," added the police.
the police also said that the public should not collect money for strangers, especially if they are claiming to be law enforcement officers.
"such callers are likely to be scammers, and the members of the public who act on their instructions may unwittingly have committed a crime by assisting to launder money from criminal activities," they added.
if they have information related to these scams, or if they have any doubts, the public can call 1800-255-0000 or submit it online at www.

lee joonmin was riding along woodlands road on monday evening (june 7) when he saw the flash of a blue and red light in his motorcycle's rearview mirror.
when he realised a traffic police officer was tailing him, the 23-year-old dispatch supervisor broke into a sweat.
"to my horror, i saw the [traffic police] officer was gesturing at me to pull over," lee said in a facebook post later that evening.
it soon went viral with over 1,200 shares.
he was stunned when the officer revealed why he was getting "booked".
[embed]https://www.
facebook.
com/chifferon/posts/4324023350982616[/embed]speaking with asiaone, lee said many thoughts raced through his mind as he dismounted his motorcycle, including "oh no, what did i do", "there goes my money", "did i fail to signal?
"he recounted how there was a "super awkward and longest sentence pause of [his] entire life" before the officer told him what he was actually pulled over for.
lee was given a reward for being a safety role model to other motorcyclists on the road, as he was wearing protective riding gear.
only then did lee breathe a sigh of relief and graciously accepted the reward — a bag filled with a mask, hand sanitiser, surface sanitiser, wet tissues, an ez-link card and a pouch.
"i never expected this to happen to me," he said.
"[the officer] really had me there.
"lee isn't the only person to have been pulled over by the traffic police for being a good noodle.
since the introduction of the "reward the riders" initiative in 2019, the traffic police have been recognising and rewarding numerous motorcyclists who wear protective gear and display good riding behaviour on the road.
[embed]https://twitter.
com/singaporepolice/status/1177967230400659456[/embed]despite the heat, the expensive riding gear and the social stigma that comes with wearing the full outfit, lee said he chose to wear the protective wear as he knew the pain that came with traffic accidents.
"i crashed three whole times within my first month of riding," he sheepishly admitted.

singapore a cyclist who punched a lorry driver in a road rage incident was fined $5,600 on thursday (june 10).
jeffery todd martin, 57, a canadian and a singapore permanent resident, pleaded guilty to one count each of voluntarily causing hurt and riding his bicycle without due regard for the safety of others.
at about 10.
20am on feb 24, 2019, martin was cycling in jalan eunos when a lorry overtook him.
he later overtook the lorry, pointing at the driver as he did so, and stopped in the middle of the lane in front of the vehicle.
this caused the lorry to stop amid moving traffic.
martin got off his bike and hit the driver's window, hurling vulgarities at the driver as he did so.
the lorry driver, chinese national zhang ping, 33, then moved his vehicle sharply towards martin, forcing him to step away.
zhang alighted from the lorry, holding an orange flask as he approached martin.
once confronted, martin punched him in the face, causing zhang to fall.
martin later cycled away as zhang remained in a daze sitting on the road.
zhang suffered cuts on his lips as a result of the punch, and was given medical leave for two days.
he was previously dealt with, and was jailed for a week for one count of a rash act endangering others.
a 30-second video of the incident had gone viral after the incident in 2019, and zhang had been arrested within 48 hours.
the same video was played in court on thursday.
after playing the video for the court, deputy public prosecutor emily koh said the prosecution would not be pushing for a custodial sentence, as the attack was one of low harm and culpability.
district judge brenda tan noted that prior to the punch, it was zhang who had come out from the vehicle to confront martin.
she said that while the custodial threshold had not been crossed, a high fine was warranted.
for voluntarily causing hurt, martin could have been jailed for up to two years on top of the maximum $5,000 fine he received for the charge.
for not riding his bicycle in an orderly manner with due regard for the safety of others, he could have been jailed for up to three months and fined up to $1,000.

singapore a football talent scout thought another man was making a rude gesture, and attacked the latter near his daughter's school in a road rage incident.
for that, marco paulo goncalves guimaraes, 43, has been jailed for three weeks.
the portuguese man was also fined $1,000 for not wearing a mask.
he pleaded guilty to the two charges on thursday (june 10) and was ordered to compensate the victim.
guimaraes is a fifa licensed players' agent who scouted for talent here and in the region to play in european football clubs.
he came to singapore in 2004 and founded the football management international company in 2010. on july 11 last year, at about 1pm, he went to pick his seven-year-old daughter from oasis primary school in punggol.
he drove along edgefield plains, the road just outside the school, intending to wait with other cars along the road for his daughter.
but another driver honked at him along the road.
after he gave way, he thought he saw the man make a rude gesture with his finger while driving past.
guimaraes then tailed the man in his car, confronting him without a mask on, at the loading bay of a nearby housing block.
as the victim was alighting from his car, guimaraes pushed the car door, causing it to hit the victim's shin.
he also grabbed the victim's wrist and they began arguing.
when the victim got out of his car, guimaraes pushed him.
the court heard that guimaraes hurled vulgarities at the victim throughout the encounter and put on a mask only when the victim started taking a video with his phone.
guimaraes also slapped the victim at the side of his head and kicked him before the police arrived.
on thursday, the court was told that guimaraes was deeply ashamed of his conduct and was pleading for leniency.
for voluntarily causing hurt, he could have been jailed for up to two years, or fined up to $5,000, or both.
for not wearing a mask without a reasonable excuse, he could have been jailed for up to six months, or fined up to $10,000, or both.

the three men and a woman, aged between 25 and 54, allegedly committed the offences in three separate incidents, said a police statement on friday (june 11).
one of them, ng chwee hock, was charged on friday for using insulting words against a public servant at redhill food centre on thursday.
the 46-year-old's case will be heard again on july 9.
"preliminary investigations revealed that (ng) allegedly used abusive language towards the sdeo, when he was advised not to sit at the table in the food centre to consume his food and drinks," police said.
sdeo refers to a safe distancing enforcement officer.
ng purportedly refused to comply even when police officers advised him to do so, and continued to verbally abuse the sdeo.
police told the straits times that he is currently under investigation for other unrelated offences.
in another incident on may 26, police received a report from an sda that a man taunted her while she was on duty in crawford lane.
he allegedly approached the sda, pulled down his mask and asked her to catch him.
another woman is said to have then approached the sda, pushed her on her shoulder and stepped on her foot.
both the man and woman then fled the scene.
police said the identities of the man, who is 54, and the woman, who is 25, were established through investigations.
they are assisting with investigations for using criminal force, voluntarily causing hurt and flouting safe distancing measures.
the third incident occurred on may 27 when police were alerted to a dispute involving a group of men at a void deck in yishun street 11. officers spotted the men allegedly gathering, with beer cans strewn across a table beside them.
a 39-year-old, who wanted to leave as officers were interviewing the group, allegedly became rowdy and hurled vulgarities after he was told to stay put.
he purportedly punched another man in the group when the latter tried to calm him down.
he was arrested for using abusive language against a public servant and causing annoyance while drunk.
the group will also be investigated for breaching safe distancing measures.
individuals found guilty of using abusive words against a public servant can be jailed for up to a year, or fined up to $5,000, or both.
for breaching safe distancing measures, a first-time offender may be jailed up to six months, or fined up to $10,000, or both.
those convicted of using criminal force can be jailed up to three months, or fined up to $1,500, or both.
for voluntarily causing hurt, an offender may be jailed up to three years, or fined up to $5,000, or both.
the offence of causing annoyance while drunk carries a maximum punishment of six months' jail and a fine of $1,000.

singapore: a man was jailed two weeks on friday (jun 11) for assaulting his wife after she rejected his request for a sexual favour.

the victim was underneath the blanket on the bed when kok began slapping her several times on her thighs and arms.
that same day, the victim sought medical attention for her multiple bruises, which included bruising over her head, face, neck, arms and thighs.
she also lodged a police report.
the prosecutor asked for two weeks' jail, noting that kok's wife has since forgiven him and they are going for matrimonial counselling.
kok, who did not have a lawyer, requested for a lighter sentence with no jail, saying he would lose his job if he was imprisoned.
he said he needed the job to support his family, including his daughter and grandmother.
he asked for a chance to turn over a new leaf and said his wife was in court to mitigate for him if need be.
the judge responded: "yes, but she was not willing to be intimate and you were violent towards her.
"she added that the high court has indicated that jail terms must be imposed for cases like kok's.
kok replied that he understood and promised not to reoffend in the future.
for breaching a protection order, he could have been jailed up to six months, fined up to s$2,000, or both.
