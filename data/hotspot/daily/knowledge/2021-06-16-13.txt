Benjamin Netanyahu loses 12-year hold on power in Israel; new PM sworn in, Middle East News & Top Stories.
gaza city: israel carried out air strikes on the gaza strip early on wednesday (jun 16) after militants in the palestinian territory sent incendiary balloons into the south of the country, in the first major conflict between the two sides since a flare-up in may in which hundreds were killed.
the strikes were the first under the new coalition government headed by naftali bennett, whotook over on sundayafter ousting former prime minister benjamin netanyahu.
and they come as more than a thousand ultranationalist demonstrators bearing israeli flags poured into jerusalem's flashpoint old city on tuesday, with scores of police deployed and international monitors urging calm.
according to palestinian sources, israel's air force targeted at least one site east of khan yunis in the south of the gaza strip, which is home to about two million people.
an afp photojournalist in khan yunis saw the explosions.
the israeli defence force said that in response to the "arson balloons", its "fighter jets struck military compounds belonging to the hamas terror organisation".
it added that "facilities and meeting sites for terror operatives" in khan yunis were targeted.
there was no indication of casualties so far.
local firefighters said the incendiary balloons caused around 20 fires in southern israel.
the violence marks the first major flare-up between israel and palestinian militants since a ceasefire came into place in may, ending 11 days of heavy fighting that killed 260 palestinians, according to gaza authorities, and 13 people in israel, the police and army there said.
restraintin annexed east jerusalem, more than one thousand people took to the streets in a delayed and controversial march by nationalist and far-right activists.
the us and un had called for restraint before the march, which bennett's new administration had authorised.
with tensions high, israeli police were deployed in heavy numbers, blocking roads and firing stun grenades and foam-tipped bullets to remove palestinians from the main route.
medics said 33 palestinians were wounded and police said two officers were injured and 17 people arrested.
the demonstration triggered protests in the west bank and gaza strip and prompted rebukes and warnings from israel's allies.
the so-called march of the flags celebrates the anniversary of the city's "reunification" after israel captured east jerusalem from jordan in 1967 and annexed it, a move not recognised by most of the international community.
tuesday's demonstration was originally scheduled for early may but cancelled twice amid police opposition and threats from hamas, the islamist group that controls the palestinian enclave of gaza.
throngs of mostly young religious men sang, danced and waved flags at the damascus gate entrance to the old city that was cleared of its usual palestinian crowds.
some chanted "death to arabs" before others quieted them.
'provocation'the march comes just two days after netanyahu was ousted after 12 straight years in power, toppled by an ideologically divided coalition including, for the first time in israel's history, an arab party.
bennett is himself a jewish nationalist but netanyahu's allies accused the new premier of treachery for allying with arabs and the left.
some demonstrators on tuesday carried signs reading "bennett the liar".
yair lapid, the architect of the new government, tweeted he believed the march had to be allowed but that "it's inconceivable how you can hold an israeli flag and shout, 'death to arabs' at the same time.
"mansour abbas, whose four-seat raam islamic party was vital to the coalition, called tuesday's march a "provocation" that should have been cancelled.

at least one deputy minister, as yet unnamed, is expected to be a member of the raam party, which is an outgrowth of the major islamist political group in israel.
as for benjamin netanyahu, "king bibi" has finally left office — churlishly, bitterly, pompously — but in keeping with the normal democratic process.
he faces criminal indictments in multiple cases.
his immediate predecessor as prime minister, ehud olmert, spent 16 months in prison on corruption charges.
it's some fascist state that subjects its leaders to the rule of law and the verdicts of a court.
meanwhile, mahmoud abbas, president of the palestinian authority, "postponed" elections in april.
he's in the 17th year of his elected four-year term of office.
a new government, even one as fragile and fractious as israel's, is always an opportunity for a course correction.
but the course correction israel most needs is not the one its critics generally suppose.
netanyahu lasted in office as long as he did not because israelis wanted a strongman or someone who would crush the palestinians.
he lasted because he was, in many ways, good at the job.
over his 12 continuous years in office, the israeli economy roughly doubled in size.
last year's abraham accords brought the overarching arab-israeli conflict to a near conclusion, even if the israeli-palestinian conflict remains unsolved.
despite periodic battles with hamas, there were no all-out wars.
israelis were more secure in their persons during the netanyahu years than they had been in the decade prior.
and israel's covid-19 vaccination campaign was the envy of the world.
against iran, israel conducted arguably the most successful covert-ops campaign in modern history.
with respect to palestinians, netanyahu avoided both the territorial concessions demanded by the left and the re-occupation of gaza desired by the extreme right.
toward the united states, netanyahu defied barack obama and got what he wanted from donald trump: the american embassy in jerusalem, recognition of israeli sovereignty in the golan heights, and u. s.  withdrawal from the 2015 iran nuclear deal.
none of this may square with the wishes of western elites or progressives, whose obsession is for a palestinian state.
but what israelis wanted in the last election wasn't a palestinian state, which is a good idea in theory but (for now) a terrible idea in practice.
what israelis want is a better form of politics, the one area in which netanyahu conspicuously failed.
it's a politics freed of his habits of demagogy, vilification, sleaziness and sheer pettiness — a politics that ultimately brought him down.
that's the promise of the new government.
it's led by naftali bennett, a right-winger and former director of the settlers' council who is the first religiously observant orthodox jew to be prime minister.
it's anchored by yair lapid, a centrist and former tv journalist who epitomizes secular israel.
it got into power thanks to the support of the raam party's mansour abbas, a religiously conservative muslim who has implicitly given a stamp of endorsement to a government whose policies — especially toward palestinians — he surely opposes.
it includes members who are to the right of likud and to the left of labor.
it's difficult to think of any coalition government, in any country, that is as ideologically diverse.
it's also easy to suppose that nothing holds it together beyond shared loathing of netanyahu, who remains leader of the opposition.
it wouldn't take much to bring the new government down and return him to power.
but there is also an opportunity in the new government, and it holds lessons for other western democracies gripped by partisanship and paralysis.
nearly all members of the new coalition had to sacrifice a point of political or moral principle, break ranks with some of their own constituents and get branded as traitors to their respective movements in order to make this coalition possible.
they are ideological turncoats, at least to those who think of ideological purity as a virtue.
being willing to abandon a ferocious conviction for the sake of a pragmatic compromise used to be considered a virtue in democracy.
ideological treason can also be a form of civic patriotism.
in what's supposed to be one of the free world's most factionalized, tribalized, internally divided countries — jews, arabs, secular, national-religious, ultra-orthodox, mizrahi, russian, druze and so on — an israeli government is giving civic nationalism a go.
it may or may not work.
but like so much else in israel, it deserves more respect than it is likely to get.

jerusalem: israel's fledgling new government faced an early test tuesday (jun 15) as jewish ultranationalists prepared to march into annexed east jerusalem, stoking tensions the un has warned threaten a fragile gaza ceasefire.
rallies by far-right jewish groups in arab neighbourhoods have raised tensions in recent months, prompting a police intervention in the flashpoint al-aqsa mosque compound that triggered the deadliest flare-up of israeli-palestinian violence since 2014. the so-called march of the flags, which celebrates the anniversary of israel's 1967 occupation of the city's eastern sector, was originally scheduled for last thursday but was delayed due to israeli police opposition to the route and warnings from gaza's islamist rulers hamas.
the former government of veteran premier benjamin netanyahu put off the march until tuesday, a decision confirmed late monday by the incoming government of prime minister naftali bennett.
"the right to demonstrate is a right in all democracies," said internal security minister omer bar-lev.
"the police is ready and we will do everything in our power to preserve the delicate thread of coexistence.
"organisers consulted police on the best route for the march that begins at 1430 gmt to avoid friction with arab residents, the government said.
but palestinian prime minister mohammad shtayyeh condemned it as a provocation.
"we warn of the dangerous repercussions that may result from the occupying power's intention to allow extremist israeli settlers to carry out the flag march in occupied jerusalem tomorrow," shtayyeh tweeted in english.
he said it was "a provocation and aggression against our people, jerusalem and its sanctities that must end".
the new israeli premier is himself a jewish nationalist but the coalition he leads also includes centrist and left-wing parties and, for the first time in the country's history, an arab party.
the support of the four lawmakers of the islamic conservative raam party was vital to the wafer-thin majority that the government won in a historic confidence vote that unseated netanyahu on sunday.
"very fragile"un middle east peace envoy tor wennesland urged all sides to behave responsibly to avoid damage to a hard-won may 21 ceasefire that ended 11 days of heavy fighting in and around gaza.
"tensions are rising again in jerusalem at a very fragile & sensitive security & political time, when un & egypt are actively engaged in solidifying the ceasefire," wennesland said.
"urge all relevant parties to act responsibly & avoid any provocations that could lead to another round of confrontation.
"the us embassy called on its staff to avoid entering the walled old city in the heart of east jerusalem because of the march and "possible counter-demonstrations".
israel's annexation of east jerusalem since the six-day war of 1967 is not recognised by most of the international community which says the city's final status should be a matter of negotiation between the two sides.
the palestinians claim the city's eastern sector as the capital of their future state.
hamas warningthe iconic al-aqsa mosque compound in the heart of the old city is islam's third holiest site and a national symbol for all palestinians regardless of religion.
it is also judaism's holiest site but by longstanding convention jews are not allowed to pray inside the compound and visits by israeli jewish politicians often trigger disturbances.
when the march was originally announced for last week, senior hamas official khalil hayya warned it could spark a return to violence like that of may 10-21.
"we warn the occupation (israel) against letting the march approach east jerusalem and al-aqsa mosque compound," hayya said.
"we hope the message is clear so that thursday doesn't become (a new) may 10.
"last month's conflict started after hamas issued a deadline for israel to remove its security forces from flashpoint areas of east jerusalem, and then fired a salvo of rockets at israel when the ultimatum went unheeded.
israeli strikes on the gaza strip between may 10 to may 21 killed 260 palestinians including some fighters, the gaza authorities said.
in israel, 13 people were killed, including a soldier, by rockets fired from gaza, the israeli police and army said.

jerusalem: the first israeli government in 12 years not led by benjamin netanyahu got down to business on monday (jun 14), with the former prime minister shying away from a handover ceremony with successor naftali bennett.
the right-wing leader's record run in office ended on sunday with parliament approving, by a razor-thin majority of 60-59, a new administration led by bennett, a nationalist whose views mirror netanyahu's on many issues.
in tel aviv, thousands turned out to welcome the result, after four inconclusive elections in two years.
"i am here celebrating the end of an era in israel," said erez biezuner in rabin square.
"we want them to succeed and to unite us again," he added, as flag-waving supporters of the new government sang and danced around him.
a combative netanyahu, 71, said that he would be back sooner than expected.
"if we are destined to go into the opposition, we will do so with our heads held high until we can topple it," he told parliament before bennett was sworn in.
the traditional handover ceremony was not scheduled at the prime minister's office, where netanyahu was expected to meet bennett later on monday to brief him on state matters.
the last time netanyahu was unseated as israel's leader, in 1999, he ended his first term in office with a glass of wine in his hand and affable words of welcome to then labor party leader ehud barak, who defeated him at the polls.
"sour, grumpy, not stately – trump-like until the final moment," yossi verter, a political affairs commentator, wrote in the left-leaning haaretz newspaper.
asked why there would be no such scene now, topaz luk, a senior aide to netanyahu, told army radio: "that's just what happens.
"netanyahu, he said, was "filled with motivation to topple this dangerous government as quickly as possible".
luk declined to disclose netanyahu's comeback strategy, pointing only to the new administration's slim margin of support in parliament.
luk said that the incoming government was receiving briefings from netanyahu's diplomatic and security advisers to ensure an orderly handover.
after holding its first meeting late on sunday, bennett's new cabinet was invited for a traditional group photograph, showcasing incoming governments, at the official residence of president reuven rivlin.
unseating netanyahuwith little in common other than a desire to unseat netanyahu, the patchwork coalition of right-wing, centrist, left-wing and arab parties largely plans to avoid sweeping moves on hot-button issues such as policy towards the palestinians, and to focus instead on domestic reforms.
palestinians were unmoved by the change of administration, predicting that bennett, a former defence chief who advocates annexing parts of the occupied west bank, would pursue the same right-wing agenda as netanyahu.
under the coalition deal, bennett, a 49-year-old orthodox jew and high-tech millionaire, will be replaced as prime minister in 2023 by centrist yair lapid, 57, a popular former television host.
united states president joe biden congratulated bennett and lapid, saying he looked forward to strengthening the "close and enduring" relationship between the two countries.
addressing parliament on sunday, bennett put biden on notice that he would follow in netanyahu's footsteps in opposing any us return to the 2015 iran nuclear deal abrogated by former president donald trump.
netanyahu was israel's longest-serving leader, and had served consecutive terms as prime minister since 2009. he used his global stature to resist calls for palestinian statehood, describing it as a danger to israel's security.
he sought to bypass the palestinian issue by forging diplomatic deals with regional arab states, on the back of shared fears of iran and its nuclear programme.
but he was a divisive figure at home and abroad, weakened by repeated failure to clinch a decisive election victory, and by a corruption trial in which he has denied any wrongdoing.

jerusalem • mr naftali bennett is a multi-millionaire former tech entrepreneur who made his political name with hardline religious-nationalist rhetoric.
a former defence minister and one-time special forces commando, mr bennett, 49, leads the right-wing yamina party, which has called for israel to annex parts of the occupied west bank.
he is israel's first premier to lead an openly religious lifestyle, with his small skullcap, or kippa, fastened to his head.
mr bennett shares this ideology with former prime minister benjamin netanyahu, having served in several of the latter's governments.
but in recent years, tensions between the two arose and intensified.
mr bennett lives with his wife gilat and four children in the central city of raanana.
the son of us-born parents, mr bennett speaks perfect english, is ultra-liberal on the economy and takes a hardline stance against israel's arch-foe, iran.
he entered politics after selling his tech start-up for us$145 million in 2005, and became chief of staff the next year to mr netanyahu, then in the opposition.
after leaving mr netanyahu's office, mr bennett in 2010 became head of the yesha council, which lobbies for jewish settlers in the west bank.
in 2012, he took charge of the hard-right jewish home party, which was facing annihilation.
he increased its parliamentary presence fourfold, while making headlines with a series of incendiary comments about palestinians.
in 2013, he said palestinian "terrorists should be killed, not released".
he also argued that the west bank was not under occupation as "there was never a palestinian state (in the area", and that the israeli-palestinian conflict could not be resolved but must be endured.
last year, in opposition and with covid-19 raging, mr bennett dampened his right-wing rhetoric to focus on the health crisis.
he moved to broaden his appeal by releasing plans to contain the pandemic and aid the economy.
former supporters and critics have accused him of betraying his nationalist voters by joining a fledgling coalition that includes the dovish meretz party and support from the arab israeli islamic conservative party raam.
but he said he is on a mission to restore israel's governance and avoid a fifth election in little more than two years.
"the core promise of these elections was to extract israel from chaos.
i chose what's good for israel," he said.

in established democracies, the tradition is for a defeated leader to act graciously toward the victor — to make a show of national unity despite the rage and humiliation that might be burning inside.
former president donald trump flushed that tradition down a gold-plated toilet, along with many other democratic norms.
he not only refused to show up at president biden's inaugural but continues to this day to accuse biden of being an illegitimate president who was fraudulently elected.
you would think other democratic leaders would recoil from trump's odious example.
not former israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu.
in leaving office, bibi, as he is known, is showing himself to be as graceless and selfish as the master of mar-a-lago.
like trump, he refused to attend the inauguration of his successor — the new right-wing prime minister, naftali bennett, who leads a coalition government with the centrist yair lapid.
shortly before the vote in the knesset that confirmed his downfall, netanyahu delivered an angry, vituperative, scorched-earth speech full of trumpian invective.
it truly has to be read for its awfulness and pettiness to be believed.
netanyahu began with lots of self-praise before segueing into attacks on the "dangerous" new government.
although bennett is also a critic of the nuclear deal with iran, bibi claimed that his former protege won't stand up to the biden administration like he would.
he even attacked president franklin d.  roosevelt for not bombing german concentration camps and the railways leading to them in 1944.  this was by way of suggesting that the united states is again doing nothing to save the jewish people from "extermination," while bibi alone protects the jews.
he claimed that bennett "doesn't have the international standing" to oppose a nuclear agreement — and won't do what netanyahu did when he spoke to congress in 2015 against the nuclear deal.
this is several orders of crazy historical revisionism.
first, historians doubt that u. s.  bombing could have stopped or even significantly slowed the holocaust.
second, netanyahu's speech to congress did not stop the nuclear accord — it only alienated then-president barack obama and other democrats, while aligning netanyahu with the republicans.
that partisanship has done long-term damage to the u. s. -israel alliance.
third, and most importantly, the iranian threat against israel has actually grown since trump, at netanyahu's urging, pulled out of the nuclear accord in 2018.  since then, iran has ramped up its nuclear program, while stepping up the production of missiles and drones and its support for regional allies such as hamas and hezbollah.
yet netanyahu claimed that iran is "celebrating" his downfall.
as if it weren't enough to accuse the new government of endangering israel's security, netanyahu also argued that it will endanger israel's economy.
"try to ruin our wonderful economy as little as possible," he said, "so that we can fix it as quickly as possible when we return to power.
"bibi then delivered his own version of trump's phony claims about a "rigged" election.
"the vote counting was kosher," netanyahu admitted, "but the winning of the votes was done fraudulently.
bennett led astray hundreds of thousands of right-wing voters and transferred their votes from the right to the left. "
as if israeli voters did not realize that in casting ballots for the parties led by bennett and his allies, they were voting to remove netanyahu from office.
because the new coalition government is backed by an israeli-arab party, bibi accused it of being the handmaiden of "extreme islam.
"bibi's final blast was very trumpian in its self-pity.
"my family and i have been through hunting, prosecution and denigration, the likes of which has never been seen," he said.
"all so that i will bow down and surrender to the left. "
just as trump claims to be fighting for "forgotten americans," so bibi insisted, "i did not surrender because i am operating in the name of a large public of millions of citizens, as the servant of a millennia old ancient people, wishing to sit in peace and security in its own land.
"what nonsense.
netanyahu is facing corruption charges in an israeli court.
the reason he did not "surrender" — the reason he put the country through four elections in less than two years — has nothing to do with the interests of "millions of citizens" and everything to do with his self-interest.
he has been desperately clinging to power in the hopes of getting the knesset to pass a law that would render a prime minister immune to prosecution.
netanyahu has genuine accomplishments to boast of — from israel's covid-19 vaccination campaign to winning recognition of israel from four muslim states.
he is much smarter than trump and much more skilled at politics.
but his farewell speech shows why so many of his former allies turned against him and ultimately turfed him out of office.
like trump, netanyahu suffers from a crippling character defect.
he lies, schemes and backstabs because politics, for him, is ultimately about self-promotion — not national service.
his farewell address showed why he should never be given another chance to lead.

israel's knessett voted to depose longtime prime minister benjamin netanyahu on sunday, ending (for now) the bibi era.
with the inclusion of a member from the arab ra'am party  in the nation's new governing coalition, the jewish state now has an opportunity to usher in an era of reconciliation.
arab-jewish relations in israel have always been tense.
israel kept arab areas under martial law from its founding in 1948 until 1966.  most israeli arabs are not required to serve in the israeli defense forces and relatively few volunteer, although their participation rose during the pandemic.
they compose roughly 21 percent of the population, but nearly all israeli arabs still live in nearly monolithically arab-populated towns.
they remain poorer and less-educated than israeli jews, even as they have equal political and legal rights.
it's no surprise, then, that arab voters have rarely supported mainstream jewish political parties.
arab parties have traditionally received about 80 percent of the vote from israeli arabs, and those parties have largely been either extreme leftists, such as the communist-backed hadash, or been connected to palestinian nationalism, such as ahmad tibi's ta'al.
the latter is so prominent and so loathed by the israeli right that netanyahu's campaign slogan in the 2020 election was "bibi or tibi," a reference to how netanyahu's opponents would have had to likely rely on the votes of tibi's party in the knesset to prevail.
those parties, needless to say, could not be part of any governing coalition.
israeli arabs who do vote for jewish parties also tend to vote heavily for those on the left, such as meretz or labor.
since there has not been a prime minister from the left since the 1999 election, this means that israel's arabs have largely been politically sidelined for decades.
the result is that many israeli arabs feel disengaged from the nation in which they live, voting at much lower rates than jews.
israel's jewish politicians are no dummies, so many started to court the arab sector in this year's election.
they knew that even a small uptick in votes could make the difference in a nation split down the middle.
the most shocking volte face came from netanyahu himself, who actively campaigned in arab towns pledging to increase funding for arab priorities.
that effort helped him somewhat, as his likud party's share of the vote rose in many arab towns.
but the real winner was an arab himself, mansour abbas.
abbas is the leader of the conservative islamist ra'am party.
ra'am is the political arm of the southern branch of that country's muslim brotherhood, and its charter strongly condemns zionism.
abbas, however, put those concerns to the side and ran on a simple platform of bread-and-butter concerns.
he went into the election arguing that israeli arabs have a lot to gain if they deal with the jewish majority rather than fight it.
he said he was open to supporting either netanyahu or his opponent, and focused his demands on fighting rampant crime in the arab community, legalizing bedouin settlements that israel has not recognized, and increasing funding for economic development.
his party surprised most observers by passing the electoral threshold and entering the knesset, israel's parliament, with four seats.
the results confirmed israel's roughly even split between pro- and anti-netanyahu factions, making abbas the country's kingmaker.
the 47-year-old abbas exploited his crucial position masterfully.
he went on israeli television in april, giving a prime-time speech in hebrew declaring that he is a "proud arab and muslim, [and] a citizen of the state of israel. "
he negotiated with both sides, and could have easily ended up backing netanyahu had ra'am's participation in a pro-netanyahu government not been blocked by bezalel smotrich, the leader of the religious zionist party.
he ended up providing the crucial votes for a government led by israel's first orthodox jewish prime minister, naftali bennett.
abbas got everything he wanted, including a promise to spend 53 billion israeli new shekels — about $16 billion — on fighting crime in arab towns and "reduc[ing] gaps" between the jewish and arab sectors.
this unprecedented political involvement heralds the chance for a new understanding between israel's jews and arabs.
much as the abraham accords promise the chance for reconciliation between jews and arabs among arab states, these abbas accords promise the chance for domestic reconciliation as well.
ethnic violence erupted within israel during the recent war with hamas, starkly demonstrating how important improving relations with israeli arabs is to israeli security.
if abbas can succeed, more arabs will see that they have a concrete stake in israel's future.
that can only make israel's future even brighter.
israel shall always be, as its basic law says, a jewish and democratic state.
sunday's historic vote will help israeli arabs to see themselves as an honored part of that state.

jerusalem • israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu's record 12-year hold on power was set to end yesterday when the knesset, or parliament, votes on a new government, ushering in an administration that has pledged to heal a nation bitterly divided over his departure.
mr netanyahu, the most dominant israeli politician of his generation, had failed to form a government after the march 23 election, the fourth in two years.
mr naftali bennett, a hawkish tech millionaire, was poised to replace him as head of a new government of unlikely allies that include left-wing, centrist and arab legislators, which he cobbled together with opposition leader yair lapid.
parliament convened to approve the government in a confidence vote that would follow speeches and a debate set to take several hours.
after its ratification, the new cabinet would be sworn in.
mr bennett, 49, an orthodox jew, will serve as premier for two years before mr lapid, a former tv host, takes over.
"thank you benjamin netanyahu for your lengthy and achievement-filled service on behalf of the state of israel," mr bennett said in a speech at the start of the session.
the government, including for the first time a party that represents israel's 21 per cent arab minority, plans largely to avoid sweeping moves on hot-button international issues such as policy towards the palestinians, and to focus on domestic reforms.
with little to no prospect of progress towards resolving the decades-long conflict with israel, many palestinians will be unmoved by the change of administration, saying mr bennett will likely pursue the same right-wing agenda as mr netanyahu.
that looked likely regarding israel's top security concern, iran.
a bennett spokesman said he would vow "vigorous opposition" should the united states return to the 2015 iranian nuclear deal but would seek cooperation with the administration of us president joe biden.
"love you, thank you!"
mr netanyahu wrote in a message yesterday, illustrated with a heart emoji, to the israeli public on twitter that featured a photo of the 71-year-old leader against the backdrop of an israeli flag.
on the international stage, with his polished english and booming baritone voice, the telegenic mr netanyahu has become the face of israel.
serving his first term as prime minister in the 1990s and since 2009 winning four more terms in succession, he has been a polarising figure, both abroad and at home.
he is loved by his supporters and loathed by critics.
his ongoing corruption trial on charges he denies has only deepened the chasm.
his opponents have long reviled what they see as mr netanyahu's divisive rhetoric, underhanded political tactics and subjection of state interests to his own political survival.
celebrations by his opponents to mark the end of the netanyahu era began late on saturday outside his official residence in jerusalem, the site of weekly protests for the past year, where a black banner stretched across a wall read: "bye bye, bibi, bye bye", referring to him by his nickname, bibi.
demonstrators sang, beat drums and danced.
but for mr netanyahu's large and loyal voter base, the departure of "king bibi" may be difficult to accept.
his supporters are angered by what they see as israel turning its back on a leader dedicated to its security and a bulwark against international pressure for any steps that could lead to a palestinian state, even as he clinched diplomatic deals with the united arab emirates, bahrain, morocco and sudan.
none of those moves, however, nor the role he played in securing covid-19 vaccines for israel's world-beating inoculation campaign, were enough to grant his likud party sufficient votes to secure him a sixth term.
mr bennett has drawn anger from within the right-wing camp for breaking a campaign pledge by joining forces with mr lapid.
he has countered that another election a likely outcome if no government were formed would have been a disaster for israel.

keep up to speed at a glance with the top 10 daily storiesa motley alliance of israeli parties on sunday ended benjamin netanyahu's 12 straight years as prime minister, as parliament voted in a new government led by his former ally, right-wing jewish nationalist naftali bennett.
bennett, a tech millionaire and former special forces commander, was sworn in at the helm of an ideologically divided eight-party bloc united only by disdain for the country's longest-serving prime minister.
netanyahu, 71, in typically combative style, vowed shortly before his defeat that "if it's our destiny to be in the opposition, we'll do so with our heads high until we take down this bad government and return to lead the country our way".
beloved as "king bibi" and "mr security" by his right-wing supporters and condemned as the "crime minister" by his critics, netanyahu has long dominated israeli politics.
but on sunday, a vote in the knesset legislature following weeks of political drama ended his government with a razor-thin majority of 60 to 59 in the 120-seat chamber.
us president joe biden swiftly congratulated bennett.
"i look forward to working with prime minister bennett to strengthen all aspects of the close and enduring relationship between our two nations.
israel has no better friend than the united states," he said in a statement.
delighted revelers packed a square near the knesset (parliament) in jerusalem and poured into tel aviv's city centre to celebrate netanyahu's fall.
throngs of people gathered in the coastal city, clapping, cheering and waving flags.
in tel aviv's rabin square, netanyahu's opponents launched into celebrations, waving "bye bye bibi" placards.
fragile coalition -bennett, 49, told the knesset before the vote that his government "represents all of israel".
he said the country, after four inconclusive elections in under two years, had been thrown "into a maelstrom of hatred and in-fighting".
"the time has come for different leaders, from all parts of the population, to stop, to stop this madness", he said, to angry shouts of "liar" and "criminal" from right-wing opponents.
netanyahu, who is battling corruption charges in a trial he dismisses as a conspiracy, has been the dominant israeli politician of his generation, having also served a previous three-year term in the 1990s.
his supporters have hailed him as a defender of israel who has been tough on archfoe iran, but who also struck a series of historic normalisation deals with arab nations last year.
being ousted from the top job leaves netanyahu more exposed to his legal troubles, denying him the chance to push through legislation that could give him immunity.
bennett, a former defence minister under netanyahu, vowed to keep israel safe from iran, promising that "israel won't let iran have nuclear weapons", a goal the islamic republic denies pursuing.
netanyahu claimed iran saw "celebrating" the birth of a "dangerous", weak left-wing government.
the diverse anti-netanyahu bloc was cobbled together by the secular centrist yair lapid, a former tv presenter.
it spans the political spectrum, with three right-wing, two centrist and two left-wing parties, and even an arab islamic conservative party.
lapid, 57, is to serve as foreign minister for the next two years before taking over from bennett.
german chancellor angela merkel on sunday congratulated bennett in comments tweeted by her spokeswoman: "germany and israel are connected by a unique friendship that we want to strengthen further.
with this in mind, i look forward to working closely with you.
"canadian prime minister justin trudeau sent a message of congratulations, adding that ottawa "remains steadfast in its commitment to a two-state solution, with israelis and palestinians living in peace, security, and dignity – without fear and with their human rights respected".
british foreign secretary dominic raab tweeted: "i look forward to continued cooperation on security, trade and climate change, and working together to secure peace in the region.
"european council president charles michel also tweeted his congratulations.
'fraud' -the improbable alliance emerged weeks after an 11-day war between israel and hamas, the islamist group that rules the palestinian enclave of gaza, and following inter-communal violence in israeli cities with significant arab populations.
netanyahu, a mastermind at navigating israel's fractious politics, had tried in vain to peel off defectors, hoping to deprive the nascent coalition of its hard-won majority.
he accused bennett of "fraud" for siding with rivals.
angry rallies by the premier's likud party supporters resulted in security being bolstered for some lawmakers.
as his grip on power slipped, netanyahu's bombastic remarks drew parallels to former us president donald trump, who described his election loss last year as the result of a rigged vote.
sunday's knesset approval also came amid heightened tensions with the palestinians.
right-wing israelis are also angered over last week's postponement of a controversial jewish nationalist march through flashpoint areas of east jerusalem.
the "march of the flags" is now slated for tuesday, representing a key early test for the new government.
gaza's rulers hamas said political developments in jerusalem wouldn't change their position on israel.
"the form the israeli government takes doesn't change the nature of our relationship," said the group's spokesman fawzi barhoum.
"it's still a colonising and occupying power that we must resist.

jerusalem: naftali bennett, who was sworn in sunday (jun 13) asisrael's new prime minister, embodies many of the contradictions that define the 73-year-old nation.
he's a religious jew who made millions in the mostly secular hi-tech sector; a champion of the settlement movement who lives in a tel aviv suburb; a former ally of benjamin netanyahu who has partnered with centrist and left-wing parties to end his 12-year rule.
his ultranationalist yamina party won just seven seats in the 120-member knesset in march elections the fourth such vote in two years.
but by refusing to commit to netanyahu or his opponents, bennett positioned himself as kingmaker.
even after one member of his religious nationalist party abandoned him to protest the new coalition deal, he ended up with the crown.
here's a look at israel's next leader:an ultranationalist with a moderate coalitionbennett has long positioned himself to the right of netanyahu.
but he will be severely constrained by his unwieldy coalition, which has only a narrow majority in parliament and includes parties from the right, left and centre.
he is opposed to palestinian independence and strongly supports jewish settlements in the occupied west bank and east jerusalem, which the palestinians and much of the international community see as a major obstacle to peace.
bennett fiercely criticised netanyahu after the prime minister agreed to slow settlement construction under pressure from president barack obama, who tried and failed to revive the peace process early in his first term.
he briefly served as head of the west bank settler's council, yesha, before entering the knesset in 2013.  bennett later served as cabinet minister of diaspora affairs, education and defence in various netanyahu-led governments.
"he's a right-wing leader, a security hard-liner, but at the same time very pragmatic," said yohanan plesner, head of the israel democracy institute, who has known bennett for decades and served with him in the military.
he expects bennett to engage with other factions to find a "common denominator" as he seeks support and legitimacy as a national leader.
rivalry with netanyahuthe 49-year-old father of four shares netanyahu's hawkish approach to the middle east conflict, but the two have had tense relations over the years.
bennett served as netanyahu's chief of staff for two years, but they parted ways after a mysterious falling out that israeli media linked to netanyahu's wife, sara, who wields great influence over her husband's inner circle.
bennett campaigned as a right-wing stalwart ahead of the march elections and signed a pledge on national tv saying he would never allow yair lapid, a centrist and netanyahu's main rival, to become prime minister.
but when it became clear netanyahu was unable to form a ruling coalition, that's exactly what bennett did, agreeing to serve as prime minister for two years before handing power to lapid, the architect of the new coalition.
netanyahu's supporters have branded bennett a traitor, saying he defrauded voters.
bennett has defended his decision as a pragmatic move aimed at unifying the country and avoiding a fifth round of elections.
a generational shiftbennett, a modern orthodox jew, will be israel's first prime minister who regularly wears a kippa, the skullcap worn by observant jews.
he lives in the upscale tel aviv suburb of raanana, rather than the settlements he champions.
bennett began life with his american-born parents in haifa, then bounced with his family between north america and israel, military service, law school and the private sector.
throughout, he's curated a persona that's at once modern, religious and nationalist.
after serving in the elite sayeret matkal commando unit, bennett went to law school at hebrew university.
in 1999, he co-founded cyota, an anti-fraud software company that was sold in 2005 to us-based rsa security for us$145 million.
bennett has said the bitter experience of israel's 2006 war against the lebanese militant group hezbollah drove him to politics.
the monthlong war ended inconclusively, and israel's military and political leadership at the time was widely criticised as bungling the campaign.
bennett represents a third generation of israeli leaders, after the founders of the state and netanyahu's generation, which came of age during the country's tense early years marked by repeated wars with arab states.
"he's israel 3.
0," anshel pfeffer, a columnist for israel's left-leaning haaretz newspaper, wrote in a recent profile of bennett.
"a jewish nationalist but not really dogmatic.
a bit religious, but certainly not devout.
a military man who prefers the comforts of civilian urban life and a high-tech entrepreneur who isn't looking to make any more millions.
a supporter of the greater land of israel but not a settler.
and he may well not be a lifelong politician either.

jerusalem: israel's parliament on sunday (jun 13) narrowly approved a new coalition government, ending the historic 12-year rule of prime minister benjamin netanyahu and sending the polarising leader into the opposition.
naftali bennett,a former ally of netanyahu turned rival, became prime minister after the 60-59 vote.
promising to try to heal a divided nation, bennett will preside over a diverse and fragile coalition comprised of eight parties with deep ideological differences.
but the 71-year-old netanyahu made clear he has no intention of exiting the political stage.
"if it is destined for us to be in the opposition, we will do it with our backs straight until we topple this dangerous government and return to lead the country," he said.
the vote, capping a stormy parliamentary session, ended a two-year cycle of political paralysis in which the country held four deadlocked elections.
those votes focused largely on netanyahu's divisive rule and his fitness to remain in office while on trial for corruption charges.
to his supporters, netanyahu is a global statesman uniquely capable of leading the country through its many security challenges.
but to his critics, he has become a polarising and autocratic leader who used divide-and-rule tactics to aggravate the many rifts in israeli society.
those include tensions between jews and arabs, and within the jewish majority between his religious and nationalist base and his more secular and dovish opponents.
outside the knesset, hundreds of protesters watching the vote on a large screen erupted into applause when the new government was approved.
thousands of people, many waving israeli flags, gathered in central tel aviv's rabin square to celebrate.
president joe biden quickly congratulated the new government.
"i look forward to working with prime minister bennett to strengthen all aspects of the close and enduring relationship between our two nations," he said in a statement after a g7 meeting in england wrapped up.
he said his administration is fully committed to working with the new government "to advance security, stability, and peace for israelis, palestinians, and people throughout the broader region.
"bennett tweeted: "thank you mr president!
i look forward to working with you to strengthen the ties between our two nations.
"much of the opposition to netanyahu was personal.
three of the eight parties in the new government, including bennett's yamina, are headed by former netanyahu allies who share his hard-line ideology but had deep personal disputes with him.
bennett, 49, is a former chief of staff to netanyahu whose small party is popular with religious jews and west bank settlers.
as he addressed the raucous debate, he was repeatedly heckled and shouted down by netanyahu's supporters accusing him of betrayal.
bennett, an observant jew, noted that the ancient jewish people twice lost their homeland in biblical times due to bitter infighting.
"this time, at the decisive moment, we have taken responsibility," he said.
"to continue on in this way more elections, more hatred, more vitriolic posts on facebook is just not an option.
therefore we stopped the train, a moment before it barrelled into the abyss.
"bennett, a millionaire former high-tech entrepreneur, faces a tough test maintaining an unwieldy coalition of parties from the political right, left and centre.
the coalition, including a small islamist faction that is making history as the first arab party to sit in a coalition, agree on little beyond their opposition to netanyahu.
they are likely to pursue a modest agenda that seeks to reduce tensions with the palestinians and maintain good relations with the us without launching any major initiatives.
"we will forge forward on that which we agree and there is much we agree on, transport, education and so on, and what separates us we will leave to the side," bennett said.
he also promised a "new page" in relations with israel's arab sector.
israel's arab citizens make up about 20 per cent of the population, but have suffered from discrimination, poverty and lack of opportunities.
netanyahu has often tried portray arab politicians as terrorist sympathisers, though he also courted the same arab party in a failed effort to remain in power after mar 23 elections.
bennett, who like netanyahu opposes the establishment of a palestinian state, made little mention of the palestinians beyond threatening a tough response to violence.
he also vowed, like netanyahu, to oppose us-led efforts to restore the international nuclear accord with iran.
"israel will not allow iran to arm itself with nuclear weapons," he said.
"israel is not party to the agreement and will maintain full freedom to act.
"but he also thanked biden for his support of israel.
he promised to take a different approach than netanyahu, who has alienated much of the democratic party through his antagonistic relationship with then-president barack obama and close ties with former president donald trump.
"my government will make an effort to deepen and nurture relations with our friends in both parties bipartisan," bennett said.
"if there are disputes, we will manage them with fundamental trust and mutual respect.
"while bennett's speech was conciliatory, netanyahu's was confrontational.
he began by boasting of his achievements, including diplomatic treaties with four arab states and a successful coronavirus vaccination drive, before belittling the man who is replacing him.
he accused bennett of abandoning israel's right-wing electorate and joining weak "leftists" to become prime minister.
he said bennett did not have the backbone to stand up to iran or pressure from the us to make concessions to the palestinians.
"i will lead you in the daily struggle against this evil and dangerous leftist government in order to topple it," he said.
"god willing, it will happen a lot faster than what you think.
"in the opposition, netanyahu remains head of the largest party in parliament.
the new coalition is a patchwork of small and midsize parties that could collapse if any of its members decide to bolt.
bennett's party, for instance, holds just six seats in the 120-seat parliament.
yohanan plesner, president of the israel democracy institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said the new government will likely be more stable than it appears.
each party in the coalition will want to prove that it can deliver.
for that, they need "time and achievements," he said.
still, netanyahu "will continue to cast a shadow", plesner said.
the driving force behind the coalition is yair lapid, a political centrist who will become prime minister in two years in a rotation agreement with bennett, if the government lasts that long.
lapid called off a planned speech, saying he was ashamed that his 86-year-old mother had to witness the raucous behavior of his opponents.
"i wanted her to be proud of the democratic process in israel.
instead she, along with every citizen of israel, is ashamed of you and remembers clearly why it's time to replace you," he said.
netanyahu's place in israeli history is secure, having served as prime minister for a total of 15 years more than any other, including the country's founding father, david ben-gurion.
but his reputation as a political magician has faded particularly since he was indicted in 2019 for fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes.
he refused calls to step down, instead lashing out at the media, judiciary and law enforcement, going so far as to accuse his political opponents of orchestrating an attempted coup.
last year, protesters began holding weekly rallies across the country calling on him to resign.
netanyahu remains popular among the hard-line nationalists who dominate israeli politics, but he could soon face a leadership challenge from within his own party.
a less polarising likud leader would stand a good chance of assembling the right-wing coalition that netanyahu had hoped to form.
it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
the outgoing israeli prime minister and his supporters are already trying to undermine the new coalition government.
will it survive?the netanyahu family is experienced in moving its belongings out of the official prime minister's residence on jerusalem's balfour street.
in 2016, prime minister benjamin netanyahu told a group of stunned settlers being evicted from their homes in the illegal west bank outpost of amona, "i understand what it means to lose a home.
after the 1999 elections, with zero warning, me and my family were simply kicked out of the house on balfour street.
just like that, with all of our belongings, we were just thrown into the street.
we had to go to the sheraton plaza hotel, it felt terrible.
"the likud party won 19 knesset seats in the 1999 elections, seven fewer than the labor party, led by ehud barak.
barak's government, just like the one sworn in on june 13, was a diverse coalition of parties, with meretz on the left, the hamerkaz party in the centre and the ultra-orthodox parties on the right.
the partnership lasted less than two years.
what can that short-lived government teach us about the future of israel's new government led by yamina party leader naftali bennett and yesh atid party head yair lapid?
what are the prospects of their diverse coalition comprising parties from the conservative jewish right, whose leaders are committed to the settlement enterprise, and lawmakers from the meretz party that boycotts goods made in the settlements?
can the fierce women's rights campaigner merav michaeli, chair of the labor party, get along with conservative interior minister ayelet shaked who has pledged to deport asylum seekers and their families?the cards that prime minister naftali bennett is holding are far worse than those barak was dealt in 1999.  first of all, there has never been an israeli prime minister, nor a leader of any democracy, whose party only won 6 percent of the vote (translated into seven seats in the 120-member knesset, one of whom is opposed to the new government).
bennett is a default option, the best of three highly imperfect alternatives, the other two being the continued rule of benjamin netanyahu after 12 years in power, or a fifth round of elections widely expected to perpetuate the political deadlock.
the new government, both its makeup and guidelines, is thus hardly the ideal choice of its left-wing or right-wing components.
bennett, as well as yisrael beitenu party leader avigdor lieberman and new hope party chair gideon saar, would have felt more comfortable in the company of their former likud party colleagues than seated alongside representatives of labor, meretz and the palestinian ra'am (united arab list) parties.
the common denominator of the new government is its disgust with netanyahu's personality and with his indictment on corruption charges.
the centre-right partners of the new government are in tune with his ideology and with his foreign and defence policies.
presumably, if netanyahu cedes his leadership of the likud, or if his party colleagues muster the courage to unseat him, many in the new government would negotiate a partnership with the likud.
however, netanyahu declared war on his successor even before he started packing and moving to the opposition benches.
netanyahu of 2021 is not the same young prime minister defeated 22 years ago who took time off from politics.
this time, he enjoys the backing of hot-headed legions of supporters and an army of violent bots.
in the government's final days, with the ground burning under their feet, leaders of the ultra-orthodox parties and their rabbis joined the chorus of incitement against bennett.
the language they adopted, and their threats of hell were reminiscent of the atmosphere that prevailed in the months prior to the november 1995 assassination of prime minister yitzhak rabin.
one of the new government's first challenges will be to douse these flames, restore trust in the country's legal system, police and the media, and try to instil respect for pluralism.
the architects of the strange bennett-lapid coalition were well aware that the opposition would identify cracks in its edifice and plant explosives to blow it up.
these explosives include legislation on highly sensitive issues, such as the relationship between religion and state, the annexation of palestinian territories, lgbtq rights and the recognition of the progressive streams of judaism challenging the monopoly of the ultra-orthodox establishment.
to defuse these time bombs, the coalition agreement perpetuates the status quo on each of these issues.
however, netanyahu has a new type of tnt at his disposal in the shape of arch-nationalist knesset member itamar ben-gvir and his arab-hating coterie.
ben-gvir was elected to the knesset this year with netanyahu's support, and is exploiting his parliamentary immunity to violate the status quo at the most volatile venues – jerusalem's muslim holy sites.
netanyahu can rely on hamas and islamic jihad to respond to ben-gvir's provocations.
and what would bennett do if rockets from gaza are fired at jerusalem in response to a visit by jewish knesset members to the al-aqsa mosque/temple mount compound, sacred to both jews and muslims?
would the two arab members of the new government, islamist ra'am chair mansour abbas and regional cooperation minister issawi frej of meretz vote in favour of retaliation against gaza and the killing of palestinian civilians?
and would lieberman and saar vote for restraint if israelis are killed in a hamas attack?and would the staunchly pro-settlement bennett, respect a court ruling to demolish the 40 homes in the illegal west bank outpost of evyatar?
how would he manoeuvre between pressure from the american administration to pursue diplomatic negotiations with the palestinians on the two-state solution, his centre-left partners who support the establishment of a palestinian state and his own strong statements against it, let alone the resentment of his partners from the right-wing parties?the negotiations on a new nuclear deal with iran are yet another obstacle facing the new government, which will force it to adopt an extremely difficult decision.
if he adheres to netanyahu's militant policy opposing the agreement, bennett will place himself on a collision course with the biden administration which will be in power throughout his two-year term.
on the other hand, if the government agrees to go along with the biden administration's policy, netanyahu is likely to launch a public campaign accusing the new government of "abandoning the jewish people to a second holocaust".
throughout his long rule, netanyahu was considered a magician walking on tightropes without a safety net.
bennett saw his performance up close when he served as his chief of staff when he was opposition leader between 2006 and 2008.  to survive in power long enough to start fixing some of the damage netanyahu has inflicted on israeli society, bennett will have to surpass his former master.

jerusalem (reuters) benjamin netanyahu's record 12-year run as israel's prime minister ended on sunday (june 13) with parliament approving a new "government of change" led by nationalist naftali bennett, an improbable scenario few israelis could have imagined.
but the razor-thin 60-59 vote of confidence in a coalition of left-wing, centrist, right-wing and arab parties with little in common except for a desire to unseat mr netanyahu only underscored its likely fragility.
addressing parliament before mr bennett was sworn in, a combative mr netanyahu said: "if we are destined to go into the opposition, we will do so with our heads held high until we can topple it. "
that will happen, the 71-year-old netanyahu added, "sooner than people think".
the new government, formed after an inconclusive march 23 election, plans largely to avoid sweeping moves on hot-button international issues such as policy toward the palestinians, and to focus on domestic reforms.
palestinians were unmoved by the change of administration, predicting that mr bennett, a former defence chief who advocates annexing parts of the occupied west bank, would pursue the same right-wing agenda as likud party leader netanyahu.
israel's longest-serving leader, mr netanyahu was prime minister since 2009, after a first term from 1996 to 1999. but he was weakened by his repeated failure to clinch victory in four elections over the past two years, including a vote in march, and by an ongoing corruption trial, in which he has denied any wrongdoing.
under the coalition deal, mr bennett, a 49-year-old orthodox jew and high-tech millionaire, will be replaced as prime minister by centrist yair lapid, 57, a popular former television host, in 2023. with his far-right yamina party winning only six of parliament's 120 seats in the last election, mr bennett's ascension to the premiership as the head of a kaleidoscope of parties was a political jaw-dropper.
interrupted by non-stop shouts of "liar" and "shame" from netanyahu loyalists in parliament, mr bennett thanked him for his "lengthy and achievement-filled service on behalf of the state of israel".
but little love has been lost between the two men: mr bennett once served as mr netanyahu's chief of staff and had a rocky relationship with him as defence minister.
in the run-up to the new government, bennett spurned mr netanyahu's call to join with him, rather than with mr lapid.
on the international stage, with his polished english and booming baritone voice, mr netanyahu has become the face of israel.
he has resisted international calls for palestinian statehood he has described as a danger to israel's security, while forging formal relations with the united arab emirates, bahrain, morocco and sudan and decrying iran's nuclear programme.
united states president joe biden congratulated mr bennett, mr lapid and the rest of the new cabinet and said he looked forward to working with mr bennett to strengthen the "close and enduring" relationship between their two countries.
"my administration is fully committed to working with the new israeli government to advance security, stability, and peace for israelis, palestinians, and people throughout the broader region," he said in a statement.
both abroad and at home, mr netanyahu has been a polarising figure.
often referred to by his nickname bibi, mr netanyahu is loved by his supporters and loathed by critics.
his ongoing corruption trial – on charges he denies – has only deepened the rift.
his opponents have long reviled what they see as mr netanyahu's divisive rhetoric, underhand political tactics and subjection of state interests to his own political survival.
some have dubbed him "crime minister" and have accused him of mishandling the coronavirus crisis and its economic fall-out.
addressing parliament, mr bennett echoed mr netanyahu's call for the us not to return to the 2015 nuclear pact between iran and world powers, a deal abrogated by mr biden's predecessor donald trump.
"renewal of the nuclear agreement with iran is a mistake, an error that would again grant legitimisation to one of the darkest and violent regimes in the world," mr bennett said.
"israel will not allow iran to equip itself with nuclear weapons.
"thanking mr biden for his "years of commitment to israel's security", and for "standing by israel" during fighting with hamas militants in gaza last month, mr bennett said his government would pursue good relations with us democrats and republicans.
"the government will make an effort to deepen and enhance our relations with both parties – bipartisan," mr bennett said.
mr bennett has drawn anger from within the right-wing camp for breaking a campaign pledge by joining forces with mr lapid – and an allegation from netanyahu that he defrauded the electorate.
mr bennett has said another election – a likely outcome if no government were formed – would have been a disaster for israel.
both mr bennett and mr lapid have said they want to bridge political divides and unite israelis under a government that will work hard for all its citizens.
their cabinet faces huge foreign, security and financial challenges: iran, a fragile ceasefire with palestinian militants in gaza, a war crimes probe by the international criminal court, and economic recovery following the coronavirus pandemic.
bennett listed as priorities reforms in education, health, cutting red tape to grow businesses and lower housing costs.
coalition leaders have said it would pass a two-year budget to help stabilise the country's finances and maintain a "status quo" on issues of religion and state.

written by roger cohena new israeli government united in its determination to oust prime minister benjamin netanyahu, but in agreement on little else, is set to take office sunday under a right-wing leader whose eight-party coalition includes the left and, for the first time, an independent arab party.
it looks like a recipe for chronic instability.
even sunday's confidence vote in the knesset, or parliament, that would usher in the first change in israeli leadership in a dozen years is not a done deal, given the razor-thin majority of naftali bennett's coalition with its 61 seats in the 120-member chamber.
but every indication is that the votes to make bennett prime minister are locked in, absent some eleventh-hour drama.
a signed coalition agreement was formally presented to the knesset secretariat friday, the last step before a vote and the swearing-in of the new government.
survival will then become the issue.
israel's parliamentary democracy veered in a presidential direction under netanyahu.
in the end, his increasingly dismissive style had alienated too many people, especially among nominal allies on the right.
agreement to return to democratic norms may be the underlying glue of the unlikely coalition.
"the parties are disparate, but they share a commitment to reconstitute israel as a functioning liberal democracy," said shlomo avineri, a prominent political scientist.
"in recent years we saw netanyahu begin to govern in a semi-authoritarian way.
"after agreement was reached friday on the government program, bennett said: "the government will work for all the israeli public — religious, secular, ultra-orthodox, arab — without exception, as one.
we will work together, out of partnership and national responsibility, and i believe we will succeed.
"success will require constant compromise.
"they will not deal with the highly contentious issues between left and right," said tamar hermann, a professor of political science at israel's open university.
in practice, that means a likely concentration on domestic rather than foreign affairs.
israel has not had a budget in more than two years of political turmoil and repetitive elections.
bennett, a self-made tech millionaire, is determined to deliver higher standards of living and prosperity to a population weary of such paralysis.
the delicate questions to be deferred or finessed would include any renewed peace negotiations with the palestinians and any major settlement expansion in the west bank.
although bennett was once a leader of the main settler movement in the west bank and has called for the annexation of parts of the territory israel captured in 1967, he seems certain to be constrained by centrist and left-wing members of the coalition and by the pragmatism that survival demands.
establishing good relations with the biden administration, a priority, and improving relations with america's majority liberal jewish community, another significant goal, will also require centrist restraint.
"hard core people of the right, we have the evidence, become more centrist in office," hermann said.
"bennett was not prime minister when he made his pro-settlement statements.
"bennett, 49, like other prominent members of the prospective cabinet, has waited a long time to emerge from netanyahu's shadow.
yair lapid, 57, the incoming foreign minister, and gideon saar, 54, who would become justice minister, are other prominent politicians of a generation weary of being sidelined by the man many israelis had come to dub the king of israel.
they will not want to return to the shadows.
lapid, a leading architect of the coalition, would become prime minister in two years under the deal that made an alternative to netanyahu possible — another incentive for him to help make the government work.
still, it may not.
the parties, ranging from bennett's yamina party on the right to labor and meretz on the left, disagree on everything from lgbtq rights to public transportation on shabbat.
they will come under withering, constant attack from netanyahu's center-right likud party.
it is conceivable that netanyahu will be ousted from likud at some point, whereupon the right-wing members of the coalition may return to their natural alliances.
"it's not going to be easy," said avraham diskin, a political scientist at hebrew university in jerusalem.
"i really doubt that lapid will become prime minister two years from now.
"among measures the prospective government has agreed on is legislation that would set a two-term limit for prime ministers.
in effect, this would preclude netanyahu redux.
four ministries will be shut down, including the digital and strategic affairs ministries.
netanyahu had a cabinet so large and unwieldy he could argue that he had to make decisions himself.
the prospective government will also pursue legislation designed to make it more difficult to change israel's basic laws, which serve as the constitutional foundation of the country in the absence of a constitution.
netanyahu, who had been indicted on fraud and other charges, appeared to seek a curtailing of the powers of the supreme court and immunity from prosecution as prime minister.
the presence of raam, an independent arab party, in government, will impact policy to some degree.
the disparities — in living standards, education and access to land — between israeli jews and the palestinian citizens of israel, who account for about 20% of the population, has become a burning issue.
violent clashes between the communities last month were the worst in two decades.
tensions remain high.
the government looks set to allocate almost $10 billion to close gaps between the communities over the next several years, freeze demolitions of unlicensed homes in arab areas, recognize three bedouin villages in the negev desert, improve public transportation, and increase policing in disadvantaged arab communities suffering from drug dealing and violence.
the posts promised to raam to secure its support include deputy minister in the prime minister's office and chairman of the knesset committee for arab affairs.
but tensions could flare at any moment.
most immediately, a nationalist march through muslim-majority areas of jerusalem's old city has been rescheduled for tuesday.
the original jerusalem day march last month was canceled because of hamas rocket fire and clashes between the police and palestinian protesters.
the issue remains highly sensitive, charged with the same emotions that led to a short war last month, despite efforts to agree on a less sensitive route for the march.
the political adroitness of bennett and lapid will be quickly tested.

jerusalem (afp) israeli lawmakers are to vote on sunday (june 13) on a change to the coalition government of bitter ideological rivals united by their determination to banish prime minister benjamin netanyahu from power.
the crunch knesset vote will either terminate the hawkish premier's uninterrupted 12-year tenure or return israel to a stalemate likely to trigger a fifth general election since 2019. mr netanyahu, who is battling a clutch of corruption charges in an ongoing trial he dismisses as a conspiracy, has pushed israeli politics firmly to the right over the years.
on saturday night, around 2,000 protesters rallied outside the 71-year-old's official residence to celebrate what they believe will be his departure from office.
"for us, this is a big night and tomorrow will be even a bigger day.
i am almost crying.
we fought peacefully for this (mr netanyahu's departure) and the day has come," said protester ofir robinski.
a fragile eight-party alliance, ranging from the right-wing jewish nationalist yamina party to arab lawmakers, was early this month cobbled together by centrist politician yair lapid.
last friday, all coalition agreements had been signed and submitted to the knesset secretariat, the yamina party announced, a moment that party leader naftali bennett said brought "to an end two and a half years of political crisis".
but the ever-combative mr netanyahu has tried to peel off defectors that would deprive the nascent coalition of its wafer-thin legislative majority.
if the new government is confirmed, mr bennett, a former defence minister, would serve as premier for two years.
coalition architect mr lapid, who heads the yesh atid party and is a former television presenter, would then take the helm.
the anti-netanyahu bloc spans the political spectrum, including three right-wing, two centrist and two left-wing parties, along with an arab islamic conservative party.
the improbable alliance emerged two weeks after an 11-day war between israel and hamas, the islamist group that rules the palestinian enclave of gaza and following inter-communal violence in israeli cities with significant arab populations.
"we will work together, out of partnership and national responsibility and i believe we will succeed," mr bennett said last friday.
sunday's crucial knesset session is due to open at 4pm local time (9pm singapore time), with mr bennett, mr lapid and mr netanyahu all set to speak before the vote.
mr netanyahu has heaped pressure on his former right-wing allies to defect from the fledgling coalition while attacking the legitimacy of the bennett-lapid partnership.
he has accused mr bennett of "fraud" for siding with rivals and angry rallies by the premier's likud party supporters have resulted in security being bolstered for some lawmakers.
mr netanyahu's bombastic remarks as he sees his grip on power slip have drawn parallels at home and abroad to former united states president donald trump, who described his election loss last year as the result of a rigged vote.
the prime minister has called the prospective coalition "the greatest election fraud in the history" of israel.
his likud party said the accusations refer to mr bennett entering a coalition that "doesn't reflect the will of the voters".
sunday's vote arrives hot on the heels of police crackdowns on palestinian protests over the threatened eviction of families from homes in israeli-annexed east jerusalem to make way for jewish settlers, a month after similar clashes fuelled the latest war between israel and hamas.
it also comes amid right-wing anger over the postponement of a controversial jewish nationalist march.
mr netanyahu favoured finding a way to allow the so-called "march of the flags", originally scheduled to take place last thursday, to proceed as planned.
he took that position despite the original route envisaging the march unfolding close to flashpoint areas including the al-aqsa mosque compound, where clashes last month triggered the gaza conflict.
the premier's insistence saw his opponents accuse him and his allies of stoking tensions to cling onto power via a "scorched earth" campaign.
if mr netanyahu loses the premiership, he will not be able to push through changes to basic laws that could give him immunity in regard to his corruption trial.
the controversial flag march is now slated for tuesday and ongoing tensions surrounding it could represent a key initial test for any approved coalition.

israel's parliament is expected to approve the formation of a new government later on sunday, ending 12 years of rule by pm benjamin netanyahu.
the prospective government an unprecedented coalition of parties has a razor-thin majority of one seat.
it would also end more than two years of political paralysis in which three elections resulted in stalemate.
right-wing nationalist naftali bennett is poised to become pm in a power-sharing deal with a centrist leader.
under the coalition agreement, mr bennett, who heads the yamina party, will hold office until september 2023, when he will hand over to yair lapid, leader of yesh atid, for a further two years.
mr netanyahu israel's longest-serving leader, who has dominated its political landscape for years would remain head of the right-wing likud party and become leader of the opposition.
he has railed against the likely new government, calling it a "dangerous coalition of fraud and surrender" and has vowed to "overthrow it very quickly".
meanwhile, his trial on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust allegations he denies continues.
mr netanyahu has served a record-breaking five terms, first from 1996 to 1999, then continuously from 2009 to 2021. he called an election in april 2019 but failed to win enough support to form a new coalition government.
two more elections followed, each of which ended inconclusively.
the third election resulted in a government of national unity where mr netanyahu agreed to share power with the then-opposition leader benny gantz.
but the arrangement collapsed in december, triggering a fourth election.
although likud emerged as the largest party in the 120-seat parliament, mr netanyahu was again unable to form a governing coalition and the task was handed to mr lapid, whose party had emerged as the second largest.
opposition to mr netanyahu staying in power had grown, not just among the left and centre but also among right-wing parties that are ordinarily ideologically aligned to likud, including yamina.
although yamina came joint fifth in the election with only seven seats, its support was critical if any potential coalition government was to have a majority in parliament.
after weeks of negotiations, mr lapid brought yamina on board as part of a constellation of parties whose only common goal was to remove mr netanyahu from office.
the agreement involving eight factions with the 61 seats required for a majority was signed on 2 june, just half an hour before a deadline was due to expire, effectively sealing mr netanyahu's fate.
in appearance, mr bennett's government would be unlike any which has preceded it in israel's 73-year history.
the alliance contains parties which have vast ideological differences, and perhaps most significantly includes the first independent arab party to be part of a potential ruling coalition, raam.
it is also expected to have a record number of eight female ministers.
the inclusion of raam and left-wing non-arab israeli parties means there could be friction on issues such as israeli policies towards palestinians yamina and another right-wing party, new hope, are staunch supporters of jewish settlement in the israeli-occupied west bank, for instance.
there could also be difficulties over social policies while some parties want to advance gay rights, such as recognising same sex marriages, raam, an islamist party, is against this.
in addition, some parties want to relax religious restrictions more extensively than yamina a national-religious party will likely allow.
mr bennett has indicated his government would focus on areas where agreement was possible, like economic issues or the coronavirus pandemic, while avoiding more contentious matters.
"nobody will have to give up their ideology," he recently said, "but all will have to postpone the realisation of some of their dreams.
.
.
we'll focus on what can be achieved, rather than arguing about what cannot. "
