Calendar Grand Slam possible this year, says Djokovic after French Open victory.
paris: novak djokovic captured his second french open title as he recovered from being outplayed for two sets by stefanos tsitsipas to win 6-7(6) 2-6 6-3 6-2 6-4 victory on sunday (jun 13).
djokovic's seismic semi-final win over 13-times champion rafa nadal looked like being in vain as an inspired tsitsipas moved to the brink of becoming greece's first grand slam champion.
after failing to convert a set point in an enthralling 72-minute opener full of brutal rallies and then crumbling in surprising fashion in the second set, djokovic looked drained.
his hopes of banking a 19th grand slam title were hanging by a thread but he rediscovered his mojo in the nick of time to turn the match around in emphatic fashion.
the 34-year-old, who won his first french crown in 2016, rattled through the third and fourth sets as tsitsipas, playing in his first grand slam final, struggled to maintain the intensity that had put him in charge.
fifth seed tsitsipas appeared to be struggling physically but valiantly tried to dig in at the start of the fifth set as the shadows spread across a sunlit court philippe chatrier.
but djokovic got the early break in the decider and although he was pushed hard, he was never threatened again.
there were nerves as he served at 5-4, netting an easy volley and then seeing a tsitsipas backhand flash past him on championship point.
but djokovic would not be denied as he claimed victory by angling away another volley at the second time of asking after four hours 11 minutes.
in moving just one behind the record of 20 shared by nadal and roger federer, djokovic became the first player in the professional era to win each grand slam title at least twice.
"it was again an electric atmosphere.
nine hours of tennis in less than 48 hours," djokovic said on court.
"it's not easy; physically and mentally it was very, very difficult for me, these three days.
i believed in my capacities and in my game.
it's a dream come true.
"djokovic earned his 19th grand slam title the hard way.
not only did he inflict only a third ever defeat on nadal, he also became the first player in the professional era to win a grand slam title having twice come back from a two sets down, having also found himself staring at defeat against lorenzo musetti in the fourth round.
there was no easing in to his first grand slam final for tsitsipas who had to save two break points in his opening service game, one with a backhand and one with an ace.
rock solidtsistipas settled quickly, however, marking out his territory with his backhand looking rock solid.
favourite djokovic was thrown off his stride when he took a heavy tumble chasing down a drop shot at 3-3 and the serb found himself in trouble at 4-5, framing a forehand high into the stands to hand tsistipas a set point.
the players traded backhands but djokovic produced a clever angle to save fend off the set point.
he then served for the set at 6-5 but produced a poor game and a tiebreak was needed to separate them.
it was djokovic who looked to be feeling the strain as he double-faulted on the way to falling 4-0 behind.
but he regrouped and produced a sensational drop volley at 3-5 before forging 6-5 ahead only to see his set point whipped away by a fizzing tsitsipas forehand.
djokovic then shunted a backhand wide to hand tsitsipas a second set point and this time the greek took advantage as djokovic's forehand misfired.
there was a hint of despondency in djokovic's body language and tsitsipas sensed it, seizing control of the match to dominate the second set after breaking early.
djokovic netted a forehand to fall 2-5 down and offered scant resistance as tsitsipas held to take a two-set.
just as against musetti in the fourth round, the backlash was instant.
djokovic began striking the ball more aggressively and closer to the lines and he engineered five break points in an energy-sapping fourth game eventually converting for a 3-1 lead when the greek missed a backhand down the line.
after winning the third set djokovic carried the momentum into the fourth and tsitsipas, who had some treatment on his lower back, appeared to be crumbling as he dropped serve twice.
the crowd tries to spur tsitsipas on in the fifth but there was no escape as djokovic rolled to victory.

novak djokovic didn't throw his racket to the sky after rallying for a five-set victory in the french open final.
he didn't tuck it away as a cherished souvenir, either.
instead, djokovic walked over to the roland garros stands and handed it to a youngster who was part coach, part fan and all heart during the match with stefanos tsitsipas.
the boy was delirious with disbelief and joy, the moment one of those purely celebratory sports encounters between superstar and fan.
afterward, djokovic explained that his gesture was a reward to a fan who had remained in his corner even when he lost the first two sets and appeared headed for defeat.
he didn't say it, but perhaps it was also djokovic's acknowledgment that he isn't always a fan favorite.
"i don't know the boy, but he was in my ear the entire match, basically.
especially when i was two-sets-to-love down, he was encouraging me; he was actually giving me tactics as well," djokovic told reporters with a laugh.
"he was like: 'hold your serve.
get an easy first ball and then dictate.
go to his backhand.
'novak djokovic battles back in french open final for 19th grand slam win"he was coaching me, literally, and i found that very cute and very nice.
to give the racket to the best person — it was him — after the match, that was kind of my gratitude for him sticking with me and supporting me.
"djokovic secured his 19th grand slam win — and his second of 2021 — and will try at wimbledon to tie the record of 20 held by roger federer and rafael nadal.

paris: stefanos tsitsipas has learnt the hard way over the last two months that novak djokovic and rafa nadal will take some shifting from the top of the men's game.
the greek led world number one djokovic by two sets in the french open final on sunday, but still ended up losing and it has become a familiar feeling to be so close and yet so far.
tsitsipas led djokovic in the rome masters quarter-finals this year, but lost.
he also pushed 13-time french open champion nadal to three tight sets in the barcelona open final, but again fell short.
the 22-year-old, who was looking to become the first greek player to win a grand slam title, is, however, confident that he is on the right path to break the dominance of the two players who have won 11 of the last 12 majors.
"i'm able to play for titles like this.
despite my loss today, i have faith in my game.
i very much believe i can get to that point very soon," tsitsipas told reporters after his 6-7(6) 2-6 6-3 6-2 6-4 defeat on court philippe chatrier.
"i was close today.
every opponent is difficult.
there's a small difference between the player i played today and the ones from before.
"but i think with the same attitude and the same if i don't downgrade myself, i see no reason for me not to be holding that trophy one day.
"on sunday, he was left to wonder how djokovic had turned his game around after losing the second set.
"what i learned today is that no matter what, in order for the match to be finished, you have to win three sets and not two.
two sets doesn't really mean anything.
it's still one away from winning the entire match," said tsitsipas.
"i don't think i changed much.
i just kept the same pace.
i kept the things that were working for me.
but it ended up, i don't know, he left the court after two sets to love down, i don't know what happened there, but he came back to me like a different player suddenly.
"djokovic took an off-court break after the loss of the second set and when he returned, the match was a different affair altogether.
asked if he felt that djokovic was physically much better all of a sudden, tsitsipas said: "felt physically, anticipation maybe, just movement on the court, everything felt much more fresh and much better than before.
"i don't know.
i kind of felt like he could read my game a bit better suddenly.
good for him.
he did well to get there.

serbia's novak djokovic celebrates with the trophy after winning the french open against greece's stefanos tsitsipas at roland garros, paris june 13, 2021.

paris, june 14 — for the second time in six years novak djokovic is halfway to a calendar year sweep of all four grand slam titles after winning the french open for a second time on sunday.
the 34-year-old dug deep into his reserves of resilience to hit back from two sets down against greece's stefanos tsitsipas to win 6-7(6) 2-6 6-3 6-2 6-4 and increase his grand slam tally to 19. that takes him only one behind the men's record 20 held by rafa nadal and roger federer and there is nothing to suggest the world number one will not surpass his two career rivals.
he can already claim something neither of those two can, after his win over the 22-year-old tsitsipas made him the first player in the professional era to win each of the four grand slams at least twice.
having already claimed the australian open this year, he has a shot at becoming the first man to win all four majors in the same year since rod laver in 1969 and he could even complete a 'golden slam' by adding the olympic title in tokyo.
"everything is possible," djokovic told reporters.
"i've achieved some things that a lot of people thought it would be not possible for me to achieve.
everything is possible, and i did put myself in a good position to go for the golden slam.
but, you know, i was in this position in 2016 as well.
"it ended up in a third-round loss in wimbledon.
"wimbledon returns later this month after last year's tournament was cancelled because of the pandemic.
djokovic won it in 2019 and will be the favourite to add a sixth title on the grass, after which he will turn his thoughts to the olympic games and the us open.
"obviously i will enjoy this win and then think about wimbledon in a few days' time.
i don't have an issue to say that i'm going for the title in wimbledon," he said.
"of course i am.
i won in '18 and '19 there.
hopefully i can keep that run going.
"as far as chasing down federer and nadal, djokovic said he has always considered it a possibility despite the fact that when he won his second grand slam title at the 2011 australian open, nadal had nine and federer was on 16.
"i never thought it was a mission impossible to reach the grand slams of these guys," djokovic said.
"i mean, i'm not there, but it's one less.
but they are still playing.
"obviously they're playing great, especially rafa with his level.
we all have still opportunities at wimbledon, all the other slams.
i'll keep on going.
i'll keep on chasing.
at the same time i'll keep on paving my own path.
"his long-time coach marian vajda joked after sunday's comeback win that he and goran ivanisevic, who is also part of the team, would retire if djokovic won the calendar slam.
"i think it is possible, much more possible.
he loves to play in wimbledon and us open," he told reporters.
"as much as novak is healthy, and he's healthy right now, he's in great shape, i think he has ability to win the grand slam for this year.
i'm pretty sure.
"it did not look likely when djokovic trailed by two sets against an inspired tsitsipas on sunday — the effort of beating nadal in a seismic semi-final appearing to catch up on him.
but djokovic said some words of wisdom from a young fan helped him out.
"i don't know the boy.
he was in my ear the entire match basically, especially when i was two sets to love down.
he was encouraging me.
he was actually giving me tactics," djokovic, who presented the excited fan with his racket at the end, said.
"he was like, 'hold your serve, get an easy first ball, then dictate, go to his backhand'.
he was coaching me literally.
i found that very cute, very nice. "

paris: after dethroning 'king of clay' rafa nadal at the french open, novak djokovic will next face a first-time grand slam finalist in stefanos tsitsipas as the world number one bids to become the first man in the open era to win all four majors at least twice.
roy emerson and rod laver are the only men to have won each of the four grand slams on two or more occasions but no one has achieved the feat since 1968, when the sport allowed professional players to compete at the majors.
a second trophy at roland garros, after his 2016 triumph on the red clay, on sunday will also give the 34-year-old serbian his 19th grand slam title one short of nadal and roger federer's men's record.
his challenger will be a 22-year-old who is bidding to become the first greek to win a singles major.
tsitsipas has long been marked out as a future grand slam champion and has already collected trophies from the season-ending atp finals and a masters 1000 tournament.
but he had drawn a blank the three times he reached the last-four stage at a major before friday's semi-final where he took down u. s.  open finalist alexander zverev in a thrilling five-set duel.
the first grand slam finalist from greece will arrive on court philippe chatrier on sunday with a 2-5 win-loss record against the serbian but will draw inspiration from the fact that he has a tour-leading win tally in 2021.
"i'm looking forward to that challenge," tsitsipas said on friday, looking ahead to his first major final.
"i'm looking forward to bring my game to kind of challenge myself to step it up.
"nothing less than his 'a' game would suffice for the greek as he has never managed to defeat djokovic on clay though he took the serbian to five sets in the semi-finals at the same venue last year.
the emotions of friday's fantastic win over 13-time french open winner nadal might leave a hangover for most players but that might not be a problem for djokovic with his incredible mental strength.
"it's not the first time that i play an epic semi-final in a grand slam and then i have to come back in less than 48 hours and play finals," he said.
"my recovery abilities are pretty good, i must say, throughout my career .
.
.
i know what i need to do.
"djokovic was happy to relax a bit and enjoy his semi-final win over his great rival but will not take anything for granted against the greek.
"he's in great form," the serbian said.
"i think he matured as a player a lot.
clay (is) arguably his best surface.
"we played an epic five-setter last year in the semis here.
yeah, i know it's going to be another tough one.
"i'm hoping i can recharge my batteries as much as i can because i'm going to need some power and energy for that one.

															afp paris novak djokovic can become the first man in 52 years to win all four grand slam titles twice in the french open final on sunday after conquering rafael nadal, the 'mount everest' of roland garros.
world number one djokovic takes on greece's stefanos tsitsipas for the title with tennis history on the line.
victory for the serb will take him alongside roy emerson and rod laver as the only men to capture the four majors more than once.
it's an achievement that has proved even beyond the capabilities of nadal and roger federer.
it is so rare an accomplishment that it hasn't happened since 1969 when laver completed his second calendar grand slam.
djokovic can pocket a 19th slam with victory and move just one behind the record of 20 jointly held by nadal and federer.
djokovic insists there will be no letdown physically or emotionally after reaching the final in paris for a sixth time with an epic triumph over 13-time champion nadal.
"it's not the first time that i play an epic semi-final in a grand slam and then i have to come back in less than 48 hours and play finals," said the 34-year-old.
"my recovery abilities have been pretty good throughout my career.
"his four-hour, four-set battle with nadal is already jostling for a prime spot in the list of "greatest ever matches" at the slams.
'never believed' -it featured a lung-busting 92-minute third set and required government intervention to allow the 5,000 fans inside court philippe chatrier to watch the match's conclusion despite it extending beyond the 11pm covid-19 curfew.
the 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 triumph gave djokovic the honour of being the only man to have beaten nadal in paris more than once, having first achieved it in the 2015 quarter-finals.
nadal has only lost three times in 108 matches since his title-winning debut in 2005. djokovic, the 2016 champion, said it was his best win in paris and ranked it among his "three greatest" ever performances.
"it's hard to find words bigger than all the superlatives you can think of for rafa's achievements at roland garros," said djokovic who now leads their series 30-28 and had lost three finals in the french capital to nadal.
"each time you step on the court with him, you know that you have to kind of climb mount everest to win against this guy here.
"djokovic has already admitted he's a fan of tsitsipas, proclaiming him as a grand slam champion in the making.
"he is a hard worker, dedicated, nice guy," said djokovic.
"he's very smart and wise.
i love the fact that he is more than just a tennis player and he's always looking to learn from experience and to understand something new about himself.
"that's the trait of a champion.
"djokovic will be playing in his 29th slam final on sunday.
he holds a 5-2 record over tsitsipas, a run which includes all three meetings on clay.
at last year's roland garros, djokovic won their semi-final over five sets.
"we played an epic five-setter last year in the semis here.
i know it's going to be another tough one," added djokovic who also defeated tsitsipas in rome on the eve of the french open.
"i'm hoping i can recharge my batteries as much as i can because i'm going to need some power and energy for that one.
"tsitsipas, 22, and 12 years younger than the serb, is in his first slam final having ended a run of three semi-final losses by defeating alexander zverev over five sets on friday.
victory on sunday would make him the first greek player to win a slam title.
he would also become the youngest champion in paris since nadal in 2008 and overall at the slams since juan martin del potro at the 2009 us open.
"i've never believed, have never really thought at what age this achievement might come," said tsitsipas.
"but i'm really happy with myself.
i think i've shown good discipline so far.
i've been progressive.
"tsitsipas is the hottest player on tour in 2021 with a season-leading 39 wins.
twenty-two of those have come on clay and have reaped a masters title in monte carlo as well as lyon.
tsitsipas also had a match point in the barcelona final against eventual champion nadal.
"there is the final on sunday, which is exciting.
i'm looking forward to leaving my entire body on the court," said the greek who knocked out second seed daniil medvedev in the quarter-finals.
heavy to very heavy rain is expected in the north and northeast of thailand on sunday due to tropical storm "koguma", the thai meteorological department announced in its 5am weather bulletin.

most thais lack confidence in govt's handling of covid crisis and see political meddling in vaccine distribution, says nida poll.
paris: rafael nadal shrugged off his epic loss to novak djokovic at the french open insisting "life goes on" as the 13-time champion suffered just his third ever defeat in 108 matches in paris over 16 years.
in their 58th career clash, world number one djokovic triumphed 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 in the semi-final and stays on course to capture a 19th major and become the first man in over 50 years to win all four slams twice.
nadal, the defending champion and chasing a record-setting 21st grand slam title, refused to dwell on the consequences of his 4-hour 11-minute loss.
"i am sad to have lost in the most important tournament of the year for me, but life goes on, it is nothing more than a defeat on a tennis court," said 35-year-old nadal.
"if everything goes well, tomorrow i will be at home with my family and friends, and then we will see what is next.
"nadal said he plans to be back in 2022 although admitting that time is not on his side if he wants to re-establish his paris dominance.
had he made sunday's championship match, he would have been the oldest roland garros finalist in the modern era.
"although it is a very important tournament for me, i am aware that you cannot win it 15 or 16 times," he added.
"next year i will come again, god willing, with the belief and with the necessary work to be able to give myself another chance.
"in their 58th career meeting, and ninth at the french open, nadal had looked comfortably on course for victory when he raced to a 5-0 lead in the first set.
but 2016 champion djokovic, the man now responsible for two of nadal's losses in paris having also triumphed in the 2015 quarter-finals, hit back.
"did not hurt him"as the match progressed into the later heavier, humid and slower conditions, the world number one flourished.
he claimed a titanic 92-minute third set which had seen him serve for it at 5-4 and then have to save a set point in the 12th game.
in the fourth set, he was 0-2 down before racing away with the next six games for his second win in paris over nadal in nine meetings.
that sequence also included defeats in the 2012, 2014 and 2020 finals.
djokovic will now be playing in his sixth roland garros final and 29th at the slams.
"in the end, of course, if you win the third set you can say that was the key, because it changes the dynamic," said nadal.
"at times, my ball did not hurt him.
you have to give him credit, congratulate him, but i know i can play better on this court.
"when asked if he had faced the best djokovic performance of their 15-year rivalry, he was adamant.
"no, that's what i feel.
he has not faced my best self either.
"there were games on the limit, games that anyone could win, and today it was for him.
"despite that, there is a degree of evidence that nadal is beginning to lose more epics than he wins at the slams.
at the australian open in february, he lost to stefanos tsitsipas from two sets up in a five-set quarter-final defeat.
tsitsipas, who faces djokovic in sunday's final, is 13 years younger than nadal.
in the wimbledon semi-finals in 2018, nadal lost a final set 10-8 to djokovic after quitting injured in the fifth set of his australian open semi against marin cilic earlier that same year.
even gilles muller of luxembourg beat him at wimbledon in 2017, courtesy of a 15-13 final set.
"it doesn't matter," added a rueful nadal.
"that's tennis.
the player who gets used to the conditions better is the player who deserves to win.

paris: world number one novak djokovic said his win over rafa nadal in friday's epic french open semi-final was one of the top three matches he had played and he would remember it forever.
the 34-year-old serb lost the opening five games but hit back in magnificent fashion towin 3-6 6-3 7-6(4) 6-2in front of a raucous court philippe chatrier crowd.
he will now face greek stefanos tsitsipas in sunday's final, where he will seek a second french open title and a 19th grand slam title in total to move one behind the men's record haul held by nadal and roger federer.
"definitely the best match that i was part of at roland garros, and top three matches that i ever played in my entire career," djokovic told reporters after inflicting only a third ever french open defeat on 13-time champion nadal.
"considering the quality of tennis, playing my biggest rival on the court where he has had so much success and has been the dominant force in the last 15-plus years, and the atmosphere which was completely electric.
"one of these nights and matches you will remember forever.
"the omens did not look good for djokovic when he went 5-0 down in the first set despite playing well.
it had horrible similarities to last year's final which he lost to the spaniard 6-0 6-2 7-5, only this time he wrenched back control.
"the beginning of the match was kind of resembling last year's final," djokovic, who enjoyed loud support throughout the four-hour contest, said.
"i was not too nervous though even if i was 0-5 down because the feeling was different from last year's final, because i was just hitting the ball better and feeling better overall.
"i just kind of found my rhythm, found my groove.
there was no looking back.
even though i lost the first set, i found my game.
things started to work out really nicely.
"freshest guyeven for a man of djokovic's physical and mental resources, the emotions of friday's win might leave a hangover and he will be fully aware that the last time he beat nadal at the french open in 2015, he ended up losing the final to stan wawrinka.
"i'm not the freshest guy right now obviously.
but the good thing is that i have a day and a half to rejuvenate," he said.
"i'll enjoy this victory a little bit.
i think i deserve after this big win to just relax a little bit without thinking about the next opponent, even though it's a grand slam final.
"djokovic saved a set point at 5-6 in a pivotal third set full of spellbinding rallies before taking the tiebreak.
he then reeled off the last six games of the match to take his record over career-long rival nadal to 30-28. incredibly, djokovic is the first player in 116 matches to beat nadal in best-of-five sets on clay after losing the opener.
asked what it meant to beat nadal at a grand slam he has owned almost exclusively since 2005, djokovic said it was difficult to put into words.
"i mean, he has been the most dominant player of the roland garros history.
he lost two, now three times, in his entire career here," world number one djokovic said.
"the amount of wins that he has made on this court isincredible.
each time you step on the court with him, youknow that you have to kind of climb mount everest to win.
"it's just one of these matches that i really will remember for a very long time, not just because i won the match but because of the atmosphere, the occasion was very special.

"in their 58th career meeting, and ninth at the french open, nadal had looked comfortably on course for victory when he raced to a 5-0 lead in the first set.
but 2016 champion djokovic, the man now responsible for two of nadal's losses in paris having also triumphed in the 2015 quarter-finals, hit back.
"did not hurt him"as the match progressed into the later heavier, humid and slower conditions, the world number one flourished.
he claimed a titanic 92-minute third set which had seen him serve for it at 5-4 and then have to save a set point in the 12th game.
in the fourth set, he was 0-2 down before racing away with the next six games for his second win in paris over nadal in nine meetings.
that sequence also included defeats in the 2012, 2014 and 2020 finals.
djokovic will now be playing in his sixth roland garros final and 29th at the slams.
"in the end, of course, if you win the third set you can say that was the key, because it changes the dynamic," said nadal.
"at times, my ball did not hurt him.
you have to give him credit, congratulate him, but i know i can play better on this court.
"when asked if he had faced the best djokovic performance of their 15-year rivalry, he was adamant.
"no, that's what i feel.
he has not faced my best self either.
"there were games on the limit, games that anyone could win, and today it was for him.
"despite that, there is a degree of evidence that nadal is beginning to lose more epics than he wins at the slams.
at the australian open in february, he lost to stefanos tsitsipas from two sets up in a five-set quarter-final defeat.
tsitsipas, who faces djokovic in sunday's final, is 13 years younger than nadal.
in the wimbledon semi-finals in 2018, nadal lost a final set 10-8 to djokovic after quitting injured in the fifth set of his australian open semi against marin cilic earlier that same year.
even gilles muller of luxembourg beat him at wimbledon in 2017, courtesy of a 15-13 final set.
"it doesn't matter," added a rueful nadal.
"that's tennis.
the player who gets used to the conditions better is the player who deserves to win.

paris (afp) novak djokovic handed 13-time champion rafael nadal only his third defeat in 16 years and 108 matches at the french open on friday (june 11) to reach his sixth roland garros final in an epic showdown which even beat the country's covid-19 curfew.
in their 58th career clash, djokovic triumphed 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 and stays on course to capture a 19th major and become the first man in over 50 years to win all four slams twice.
djokovic, the 2016 champion in paris who had also beaten nadal at the 2015 tournament, will face stefanos tsitsipas in sunday's final in what will be his 29th championship match at the slams.
tsitsipas had earlier become the first greek to reach a grand slam final with a 6-3, 6-3, 4-6, 4-6, 6-3 victory over germany's alexander zverev.
nadal, 35, who would have been the oldest finalist at the french open in the modern era, remains tied on 20 majors with roger federer.
"it was a privilege to face rafa in such an incredible match," said djokovic after four hours and 11 minutes of intense action.
"tonight it was my greatest ever match in paris. "
it was his second win in eight meetings in paris with nadal, a sequence which also included three losses in finals.
it was nadal's first defeat in 14 semi-finals in the french capital.
"probably it was not my best day today, even if i fought," said nadal.
"sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.
i had a big chance.
there were some crazy points but there was fatigue there.
"djokovic finished with 50 winners; nadal committed 55 unforced errors under the relentless assault.
djokovic had two break points in the opening game of the first set which stretched to 10 minutes but was unable to convert.
nadal made him pay, sprinting away for a 5-0 lead before the top seed got on the board.
djokovic clung on, retrieving one break to get to 2-5 but nadal eventually prevailed after one hour on court even if he required seven set points to edge ahead.
as a sign of the tension of the occasion, nadal complained to chair umpire eva asderaki-moore that he needed more time to collect his towel.
djokovic aired his bemusement at the amount of clay on the baselines.
the old rivals exchanged breaks in the second and third games of a big-hitting second set but it was djokovic who repeated the feat for a 4-2 lead before levelling the tie.
twice in the third set djokovic edged ahead, only to be reeled back in by nadal who broke back in the 10th game as the world number one served for the set.
djokovic then had to save a set point with an ice-cool drop shot in the 12th game.
"you cannot play better clay court tennis than this.
it's perfect," tweeted andy murray.
a 92-minute third set ended with djokovic taking the tiebreak.
in a further twist on a dramatic evening, the 5,000 spectators inside court philippe chatrier were allowed to watch the conclusion of the match despite it passing the 11pm covid-19 curfew.
"in agreement with the national authorities, the match will come to an end in your presence," said a stadium announcer told delighted fans.
nadal then broke in the first game of the fourth set but djokovic levelled for 2-2 and broke again for 4-2. he finished it off on a second match point when nadal hit wide and long.

"tonight it was my greatest ever match in paris.
"it was his second win in nine meetings in paris with nadal, a sequence which also included three losses in finals.
"definitely one of the top three matches that i ever played in my entire career," said djokovic.
"considering quality of tennis, playing my biggest rival on the court where he has had so much success and has been the dominant force in the last 15-plus years, and the atmosphere which was completely electric.
just amazing.
"it was nadal's first defeat in 14 semi-finals in the french capital.
"probably it was not my best day today, even if i fought," said nadal.
"sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.
i had a big chance.
there were some crazy points but there was fatigue there.
"djokovic finished with 50 winners; nadal committed 55 unforced errors under the relentless assault.
"it's hard to find words bigger than all the superlatives you can think of for rafa's achievements in roland garros," added 34-year-old djokovic who now leads their series 30-28.
"each time you step on the court with him, you know that you have to kind of climb mount everest to win against this guy here.
"djokovic had two break points in the opening game of the first set which stretched to 10 minutes but was unable to convert.
curfew-buster nadal made him pay, sprinting away for a 5-0 lead before the top seed got on the board.
