singapore: as singapore begins to vaccinate younger age groups against covid-19, some companies have introduced measures to encourage employees to get their jabs and to support those who may suffer side effects.
the registration exercise for singaporeans aged 12 to 39 began on jun 11.  this is a big group of about 1.
5 million people, health minister ong ye kung had said.
beyond giving employees time off to get vaccinated, companies cna spoke to said they have other support initiatives in place.
at singtel, for instance, employees are entitled to sick leave on the day of vaccination.
they can also work from home for a week after if they feel unwell, said the company's chief human resources officer aileen tan.
employees are also covered under the company's insurance plan, which defrays the cost of medical expenses for any sickness or disability resulting from the vaccination, said ms tan.
she added that singtel also invited infectious diseases expert dr leong hoe nam to clarify any doubts staff members may have about the vaccine.
more than 90 per cent of singtel employees in frontline roles, such as retail staff and field engineers, are fully vaccinated, said ms tan.
at ocbc bank, employees taking the vaccine are given a day off for each appointment, as well as private taxi reimbursement to and from the vaccination centres.
if they experience side effects, they may take an additional two days of medical leave without needing to provide a medical certificate.
the company will reimburse any medical consultation fees as well, said mr ernest phang, head of corporate services under group human resources.
"for those who decided to go ahead with (getting vaccinated), we will provide the necessary support to them because we understand the anxiety and stress that comes from having to make such a decision," he added.
similarly at uob, those who suffer side effects can tap the company's appointed panel of clinics for free medical consultation.
they also have life and health insurance that covers covid-19 infection and vaccination side effects.
"those who feel unwell after the vaccination are advised to consult a doctor immediately and to be on medical leave as advised by the doctor," said head of group human resources dean tong.
the side effects of the covid-19 vaccine include fever, chills, headaches, joint pain and tiredness.
"most side effects are mild or moderate, and usually get better within a few days," said the ministry of health.
according to the us centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), side effects after the second shot may be more intense than after the first dose.
in addition, younger people are more likely to experience side effects compared to older people, said the cdc.
to allow employees to obtain online approval for essential facility visits and report covid-19 cases, sembcorp industries has come up with an app that was developed in-house.
"with the health and safety of our employees as our top priority in this pandemic, sembcorp has introduced a covid-19 app for employees to obtain online approval for essential facility visits, as well as to report cases," a spokesperson said.
the app also allows employees to provide voluntary updates on their vaccination status.
companies cna spoke to stressed that it is important for employees to rest if they don't feel well after vaccination.
"in the event that (employees) feel unwell after their vaccination, we encourage them to take ample rest to recover," said an ntuc fairprice spokesperson, adding that as frontline workers, its employees were given priority for vaccination earlier this year.
"fairprice encourages all staff to be vaccinated, and to allay any concerns as well as to address queries, we invite medical experts to conduct online talks so that staff are better informed on the benefits of vaccination.
"our leadership team also seeks to motivate staff by serving as an example and going for the vaccination when it is their turn," the spokesperson said.

singapore: all seven insurers offering integrated shield plans are extending their coverage of hospitalisation resulting from covid-19 vaccine complications to include vaccines brought in under the special access route, such as the sinovac jab.
this will apply to policyholders who receive covid-19 vaccines that are approved by the world health organization (who) under its emergency use listing and administered in singapore under the special access route, said the life insurance association, singapore (lia singapore).
the additional coverage will be provided until dec 31, said the association on thursday (jun 17).
it added that it will work with insurers for any consideration of extensions to the duration of coverage, alongside monitoring the evolving covid-19 situation.
currently,only the sinovac vaccineis administered under the special access route, which allows private healthcare institutions to bring in unregistered covid-19 vaccines.
vaccines brought in under the special access route must be on the who's emergency use listing.
the listing also includes shots by johnson & johnson, astrazeneca and sinopharm.
hospitalisation for complications arising from the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines, which have been approved by singapore's health sciences authority and are part of the country's national inoculation programme, isalready covered under integrated shield plans.
both are messenger rna (mrna) vaccines.
"we understand that some singaporeans may wish to receive vaccination under (the special access route) and hope that our member insurers' proactive commitment in extending inpatient hospitalisation benefits for complications can provide assurance that such (integrated shield plan) policyholders will be covered," said lia singapore president khor hock seng.
the sinovac jab, an inactivated virus vaccine, is free for those who were previously rejected from taking the mrna vaccines due to severe allergies or allergic reactions to the first dose.
others who prefer the sinovac vaccine for non-medical reasons pay an administrative fee to the private healthcare providers.
those who take the sinovac vaccine are not covered under the vaccine injury financial assistance programme for covid-19 vaccination.
integrated shield plans are made up of two components â medishield life run by the central provident fund board and an additional private insurance coverage component run by insurance companies.
the latter covers hospitalisation in a- and b1-type wards in public hospitals as well as private hospitals.
insurers offering integrated shield plans are: aia, aviva, axa, great eastern life, ntuc income, prudential and raffles health insurance.

singapore twenty-four private healthcare institutions have been selected by the ministry of health (moh) to be licensed providers of sinovac's covid-19 vaccine.
moh said on wednesday night (june 16) that they will be able to draw on an existing stock of the vaccine, and can administer it to singaporeans, permanent residents and long-term pass holders here.
the ministry added that as the vaccine is being provided to the institutions at no cost, the providers should not charge people for the cost of the vaccines.
there should not be any additional costs beyond vaccination administration fees, which already include consultation charges and seven per cent gst, said moh.
these range from $10 to $25 per dose.
those interested may contact the providers directly from june 18 for more details on how they may receive the vaccine.
the 24 were chosen based on their ability to administer the vaccines safely, properly and efficiently, said moh, adding that it had also considered their vaccination administration fees, experience in vaccine administration and compliance history at past licensing inspections.
this will ensure that the services will be safe and affordable to members of public, said the ministry.
moh added that only 24 providers were approved, to ensure economies of scale for each institution administering the vaccines.
[[nid:515527]]price and quality parameters were taken into consideration, as was the geographical spread of the providers, to ensure accessibility to members of the public.
moh added that as sinovac's vaccine remains unregistered and is not authorised by the health sciences authority (hsa) for use under the pandemic special access route, it is to be provided only under the special access route (sar) framework, and hence will not be covered under the vaccine injury financial assistance programme meant for the national vaccination programme.
"individuals who nevertheless wish to receive sinovac-coronavac vaccinations under the sar framework should discuss with their doctors in the selected private healthcare institutions the risks and benefits of using the sinovac-coronavac vaccine, and jointly make an informed decision," the ministry cautioned.

singapore: more households are using english as the language most frequently spoken at home, according to singapore's latest census of population released by the department of statistics (dos) on wednesday (jun 16).
among residents aged five and above in 2020, 48.
3 per cent spoke english most frequently at home, up from 32.
3 per cent in 2010. of those who spoke english most frequently at home, about 87 per cent also spoke a vernacular language in the same setting, the census noted.
the census of population, conducted once every 10 years, is the largest national survey undertaken in singapore to collect statistics such as demographic, social and economic data.
a total of 150,000 households were surveyed last year.
english more common across major ethnic groupsthe trend on the use of english at home was observed across all major ethnic groups.
correspondingly, the use of mandarin, chinese dialects, malay and tamil lost ground.
for the chinese ethnic group, english overtook mandarin as the most used language at home â with a proportion of 47.
6 per cent in 2020, up from 32.
6 per cent in 2010. the use of mandarin as the predominant language fell to 40.
2 per cent in 2020, down from 47.
7 per cent a decade before.
the same goes for chinese dialects, which only accounted for 11.
8 per cent of responses, down from 19.
2 per cent in 2010. for the malay ethnic group, a majority still spoke the malay language most frequently at home in 2020.  but at 60.
7 per cent, this was lower than the 82.
7 per cent recorded in 2010, said the dos.
the proportion who used english most frequently rose to 39 per cent in 2020, more than double the 17 per cent from a decade before.
among this group, malay is still the second most frequently spoken language for more than nine in 10 respondents.
for the indian ethnic group, those who spoke english most frequently continued to form the majority at 59.
2 per cent, up from 41.
6 per cent in 2010. after english, tamil or other indian languages were the second most frequently spoken language.
taking age into accountthe use of english at home was generally more common among the younger population than those who are older, the department of statistics said.
for chinese residents, for instance, nearly eight in 10 of those aged between five and 14 used english the most at home in 2020.  this is compared to about three in 10 elderly residents â aged 55 and over â who did the same.
this disparity was also seen among the malays about six in 10 of young residents spoke english the most, compared to fewer than two in 10 for the elderly.
the gap was narrower for the indian ethnic group.
about seven in 10 of the young residents used english the most at home, while half of elderly residents did so.
overall, between 2010 and 2020, the use of english grew across all age groups for all ethnic groups.
throwing education into the mixthis proportion also rose across all education groups, the dos said.
"in general, residents with higher qualifications were more likely to use english the most frequently at home," it added.
for example, among singapore residents aged 15 and above with university degrees, english was the most-used language at home for about six in 10 of the chinese, malays and indians in 2020. but among those with below secondary qualifications, this figure fell to about one in 10 for the chinese and malays, and about three in 10 for indians, said the dos.

twenty-four private healthcare institutions have been selected by the ministry of health (moh) to be licensed providers of sinovac's covid-19 vaccine.
moh said yesterday night that the clinics will be able to draw on an existing stock of the vaccine, and can administer it to singaporeans, permanent residents and long-term pass holders here.
the ministry added that as the vaccine is being provided to the institutions at no cost, the providers should not charge people for the cost of the vaccines.
there should not be any additional costs beyond vaccination administration fees, which already include consultation charges and 7 per cent gst, said moh.
these range from $10 to $25 per dose.
those interested may contact the providers directly from tomorrow for more details.
the 24 clinics were chosen based on their ability to administer the vaccines safely, properly and efficiently, said moh, adding that it had also considered their vaccination administration fees, experience in vaccine administration, and compliance history at past licensing inspections.
this will ensure that the services will be safe and affordable to members of public, said the ministry.
moh added that only 24 providers were approved, to ensure economies of scale for each institution administering the vaccines.
price and quality parameters were taken into consideration, as was the geographical spread of the providers, to ensure accessibility to members of the public.
moh added that as sinovac's vaccine remains unregistered and is not authorised by the health sciences authority for use under the pandemic special access route, it is to be provided only under the special access route (sar) framework, and hence will not be covered under the vaccine injury financial assistance programme meant for the national vaccination programme.
"individuals who nevertheless wish to receive sinovac-coronavac vaccinations under the sar framework should discuss with their doctors in the selected private healthcare institutions the risks and benefits of using the sinovac-coronavac vaccine, and jointly make an informed decision," cautioned the ministry.

singapore: singapore's total population saw its lowest decade of growth since independence between 2010 and 2020, increasing by 1.
1 per cent a year a slowdown from the 2.
5 per cent per year between 2000 and 2010. this was among the findings released on wednesday (jun 16) by the department of statistics (dos) in its first statistical release from its census of the population in 2020.  more information from the census will be released on friday.
the census â singapore's largest national statistical exercise â is conducted once a decade to collect demographic, social and economic data, among others.
it surveyed 150,000 households last year.
"it tells us where we were, where we're at now, and identifies some of the things that we need to address going forward," said indranee rajah, minister in the prime minister's office, who oversees the national population and talent division.
though some of the data will be affected as the survey was done amid the covid-19 pandemic, she said the census captures "broad trends over the decade .
.
.
notwithstanding the blips over the last one and a half years".
the total population increased from 5.
08 million in 2010 to5.
69 millionin 2020.  within this, the citizen population grew from 3.
23 million to 3.
52 million, while the permanent resident population remained "stable" at around 0.
5 million, it added.
the number of non-residents increased from 1.
31 million to 1.
64 million.
ms indranee pointed out that singapore citizens accounted for a greater proportion of the growth this decade, while non-residents grew at a slower rate than before.
the dos also said ethnic compositions for citizen and resident populations remained stable.
at the same time, the country's population continued to age.
in 2020, 15.
2 per cent of the resident population was aged 65 and above, up from 9 per cent in 2010. the median age of the resident population also rose to 41.
5 years in 2020, up from 37.
4 years in 2010. rise in singlehoodthe census showed that singlehood has become more prevalent across multiple age groups over the last decade â particularly among younger residents aged 25 to 34. the proportion of singles rose among all age groups that fell within the bracket of 20 to 49 years old.
the largest increase in the proportion of single people was seen among those aged 25 to 29.  the proportion of single women in this group rose from 54 per cent in 2010 to 69 per cent, while single men grew from 74.
6 per cent to 81.
6 per cent in this age group.
not far behind were those aged 30 to 34: the proportion of single women in this bracket went up from 25.
1 per cent to 32.
8 per cent, while that of men increased from 37.
1 per cent to 41.
9 per cent.
when sorted by ethnic group, data showed that the chinese had the highest proportion of singles.
for instance, in 2020, among residents aged 40 to 49, about 17.
4 per cent and 18.
6 per cent of chinese men and women were single.
this was higher than 15 per cent and 9.
2 per cent for malay men and women respectively, and 6.
2 and 6.
3 per cent for indian men and women.
fewer children bornat the same time, women generally had fewer children in 2020 compared to a decade before, said the dos.
among female residents aged 15 and above who have ever been married, the average number of children born fell across all age brackets.
the average decreased from 2.
24 children per woman in 2010, to 2.
04 in 2020. lower averages were also seen across all educational groups, said the dos, adding that the largest decrease was observed among women with below secondary qualifications.
in 2010, women in this group aged 40 to 49 had an average of 2.
21 children, but in 2020, this figure fell to 2.
01. still, in line with previous trends, higher educated females had fewer children on average than those with lower educational qualifications.
among these female residents aged 40 to 49, university graduates had an average of 1.
66 children in 2020 â lower than the average of 1.
94 children among those with secondary qualifications, the dos said.
education levels improvethe educational profile of the resident population improved between 2010 and 2020. in 2020, among residents aged 25 and above, nearly six in ten had post-secondary or higher qualifications.
this is up from less than five in 10 in 2010.
"the chinese, malay and indian communities all saw improvements in their educational attainment," added the dos.
it also noted that women have "made more significant progress" in this aspect.
for instance, among residents aged 55 and over in 2020, the proportion of men with post-secondary or higher qualifications was 11.
2 percentage points higher than that of women.
this narrowed to a 2.
4 percentage-point difference among those aged 35 to 44. among those aged 25 to 34, the proportion for women â at 90.
2 per cent marginally beat the figure for men, which was 90 per cent.
overall, literacy rates rose to 97.
1 per cent in 2020, up from 95.
9 per cent in 2010. across all age groups, multi-language literacy rates were also higher or remained stable.
there was an overall increase in english literacy across the three major ethnic groups, the dos noted.
relevance of sorting data by ethnic groupsat a press conference on the release of the data, ms indranee was asked by reporters about the continued relevance of separating data by ethnic categories, given that there may be sharp inequalities even within these groups.
ms indranee said being a multi-racial and multi-religious state is "a constant work in progress".
"(this) also means that you don't really ever get to a post-race situation where it doesn't matter at all.
"she added: "if you didn't have this data then let's say that a particular ethnic group was not doing well compared to the others.
you will have no idea how many, you will have no idea in what areas, you wouldn't know whether the problem was education, or whether the problem was something else.
"all you would have is just one big blob of data, and you will have no ability to say, actually this group is not doing so well.
what are the reasons, how can we help, what are the interventions that we can make?
""the thinking behind this data is: to the extent that any group may not be doing as well as any others in any areas, then it tells us that as a society in terms of policy, then we should do something to try and make sure that we can bridge any gap.

singapore: twenty-four private healthcare institutions have been selected to administer the government's stock of sinovac covid-19 vaccines, the ministry of health (moh) said on wednesday (jun 16).
fees range from s$10 to s$25 for a single dose.
through the special access route (sar) for unauthorised covid-19 vaccines, the providers can draw upon moh's existing stock to administer sinovac's two-dose vaccine to singaporeans, permanent residents and those holding long-term passes.
applications by providers to administer the vaccine were reviewed based on their ability to do so safely, properly and efficiently, moh said.
other factors the ministry considered were the providers' proposed vaccination administration fees, experience in vaccine administration and its compliance history at past licensing inspections.
this was done to ensure that services would be safe and affordable to members of public, said moh.
"as these vaccines are being provided to the providers at no cost, individuals should take note that the providers should not charge them for the vaccine cost," moh added.
the fees listed are also inclusive of consultation and 7 per cent gst.
"there should not be any additional costs (beyond the vaccination administration fees listed) charged by these providers," said moh.
those interested in receiving the sinovac vaccine may contact the providers directly from jun 18 for more information.
the ministry also reiterated that sinovac is not part of the national vaccine programme and therefore will not be covered under the vaccine injury financial assistance programme for covid-19 vaccination.
those who still wish to receive the vaccine through the sar should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctors at their selected private healthcare institutions, moh said.

singapore: as singapore begins to vaccinate younger age groups against covid-19, some companies have introduced measures to encourage employees to get their jabs and to support those who may suffer side effects.
the registration exercise for singaporeans aged 12 to 39 began on jun 11.  this is a big group of about 1.
5 million people, health minister ong ye kung had said.
beyond giving employees time off to get vaccinated, companies cna spoke to said they have other support initiatives in place.
at singtel, for instance, employees are entitled to sick leave on the day of vaccination.
they can also work from home for a week after if they feel unwell, said the company's chief human resources officer aileen tan.
employees are also covered under the company's insurance plan, which defrays the cost of medical expenses for any sickness or disability resulting from the vaccination, said ms tan.
she added that singtel also invited infectious diseases expert dr leong hoe nam to clarify any doubts staff members may have about the vaccine.
more than 90 per cent of singtel employees in frontline roles, such as retail staff and field engineers, are fully vaccinated, said ms tan.
at ocbc bank, employees taking the vaccine are given a day off for each appointment, as well as private taxi reimbursement to and from the vaccination centres.
if they experience side effects, they may take an additional two days of medical leave without needing to provide a medical certificate.
the company will reimburse any medical consultation fees as well, said mr ernest phang, head of corporate services under group human resources.
"for those who decided to go ahead with (getting vaccinated), we will provide the necessary support to them because we understand the anxiety and stress that comes from having to make such a decision," he added.
similarly at uob, those who suffer side effects can tap the company's appointed panel of clinics for free medical consultation.
they also have life and health insurance that covers covid-19 infection and vaccination side effects.
"those who feel unwell after the vaccination are advised to consult a doctor immediately and to be on medical leave as advised by the doctor," said head of group human resources dean tong.
the side effects of the covid-19 vaccine include fever, chills, headaches, joint pain and tiredness.
"most side effects are mild or moderate, and usually get better within a few days," said the ministry of health.
according to the us centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), side effects after the second shot may be more intense than after the first dose.
in addition, younger people are more likely to experience side effects compared to older people, said the cdc.
to allow employees to obtain online approval for essential facility visits and report covid-19 cases, sembcorp industries has come up with an app that was developed in-house.
"with the health and safety of our employees as our top priority in this pandemic, sembcorp has introduced a covid-19 app for employees to obtain online approval for essential facility visits, as well as to report cases," a spokesperson said.
the app also allows employees to provide voluntary updates on their vaccination status.
companies cna spoke to stressed that it is important for employees to rest if they don't feel well after vaccination.
"in the event that (employees) feel unwell after their vaccination, we encourage them to take ample rest to recover," said an ntuc fairprice spokesperson, adding that as frontline workers, its employees were given priority for vaccination earlier this year.
"fairprice encourages all staff to be vaccinated, and to allay any concerns as well as to address queries, we invite medical experts to conduct online talks so that staff are better informed on the benefits of vaccination.
"our leadership team also seeks to motivate staff by serving as an example and going for the vaccination when it is their turn," the spokesperson said.

covid-19: there were two cases of hospitalisation linked to vaccines (file).
a government report has, for the first time, acknowledged one death in india due to vaccination.
a 68-year-old man, fully vaccinated, died on march 31 and it has been labelled as "vaccine product related reaction" in a report assessing 31 severe cases reported since the government launched the vaccine drive in january.
the report is by the national adverse events following immunization (aefi) committee under the union health ministry.
of the 31 cases, 28 are deaths.
"this is the first death where causality has been established, with vaccine resulting in an anaphylaxis reaction.
but compared to the overall numbers, only a small number had a severe reaction.
31 cases were investigated and one death was due to vaccine, and among anaphylaxis cases, only two were found to be product-related.
most anaphylaxis reactions are managed," said nk arora, advisor, national aefi committee.
of 31 cases, three cases were reported as "anaphylaxis" or any severe reaction experienced by the person half an hour after the shot.
two of them were hospitalized and discharged but one died.
eighteen cases were found to be unrelated to vaccines and classified as "coincidental".
there were two cases of hospitalisation linked to vaccines.
in seven cases, there is no definite evidence to link the deaths to vaccines.
in the case of two cases, there is not enough information.
"overall, the benefits of vaccination are overwhelmingly greater than the small risk of harm," the health ministry said.
"mere reporting of deaths and hospitalizations as serious adverse events did not automatically imply that the events were caused due to vaccines.
data from the first week of april shows the reporting rate is 2.
7 deaths per million vaccine doses administered and 4.
8 hospitalizations per million vaccine doses administered," the ministry explained.

singapore: singapore's total population saw its lowest decade of growth since independence between 2010 and 2020, increasing by 1.
1 per cent a year a slowdown from the 2.
5 per cent per year between 2000 and 2010. this was among the findings released on wednesday (jun 16) by the department of statistics (dos) in its first statistical release from its census of the population in 2020.  more information from the census will be released on friday.
the census â singapore's largest national statistical exercise â is conducted once a decade to collect demographic, social and economic data, among others.
it surveyed 150,000 households last year.
"it tells us where we were, where we're at now, and identifies some of the things that we need to address going forward," said indranee rajah, minister in the prime minister's office, who oversees the national population and talent division.
though some of the data will be affected as the survey was done amid the covid-19 pandemic, she said the census captures "broad trends over the decade .
.
.
notwithstanding the blips over the last one and a half years".
the total population increased from 5.
08 million in 2010 to5.
69 millionin 2020.  within this, the citizen population grew from 3.
23 million to 3.
52 million, while the permanent resident population remained "stable" at around 0.
5 million, it added.
the number of non-residents increased from 1.
31 million to 1.
64 million.
ms indranee pointed out that singapore citizens accounted for a greater proportion of the growth this decade, while non-residents grew at a slower rate than before.
the dos also said ethnic compositions for citizen and resident populations remained stable.
at the same time, the country's population continued to age.
in 2020, 15.
2 per cent of the resident population was aged 65 and above, up from 9 per cent in 2010. the median age of the resident population also rose to 41.
5 years in 2020, up from 37.
4 years in 2010. rise in singlehoodthe census showed that singlehood has become more prevalent across multiple age groups over the last decade â particularly among younger residents aged 25 to 34. the proportion of singles rose among all age groups that fell within the bracket of 20 to 49 years old.
the largest increase in the proportion of single people was seen among those aged 25 to 29.  the proportion of single women in this group rose from 54 per cent in 2010 to 69 per cent, while single men grew from 74.
6 per cent to 81.
6 per cent in this age group.
not far behind were those aged 30 to 34: the proportion of single women in this bracket went up from 25.
1 per cent to 32.
8 per cent, while that of men increased from 37.
1 per cent to 41.
9 per cent.
when sorted by ethnic group, data showed that the chinese had the highest proportion of singles.
for instance, in 2020, among residents aged 40 to 49, about 17.
4 per cent and 18.
6 per cent of chinese men and women were single.
this was higher than 15 per cent and 9.
2 per cent for malay men and women respectively, and 6.
2 and 6.
3 per cent for indian men and women.
fewer children bornat the same time, women generally had fewer children in 2020 compared to a decade before, said the dos.
among female residents aged 15 and above who have ever been married, the average number of children born fell across all age brackets.
the average decreased from 2.
24 children per woman in 2010, to 2.
04 in 2020. lower averages were also seen across all educational groups, said the dos, adding that the largest decrease was observed among women with below secondary qualifications.
in 2010, women in this group aged 40 to 49 had an average of 2.
21 children, but in 2020, this figure fell to 2.
01. still, in line with previous trends, higher educated females had fewer children on average than those with lower educational qualifications.
among these female residents aged 40 to 49, university graduates had an average of 1.
66 children in 2020 â lower than the average of 1.
94 children among those with secondary qualifications, the dos said.
education levels improvethe educational profile of the resident population improved between 2010 and 2020. in 2020, among residents aged 25 and above, nearly six in ten had post-secondary or higher qualifications.
this is up from less than five in 10 in 2010.
"the chinese, malay and indian communities all saw improvements in their educational attainment," added the dos.
it also noted that women have "made more significant progress" in this aspect.
for instance, among residents aged 55 and over in 2020, the proportion of men with post-secondary or higher qualifications was 11.
2 percentage points higher than that of women.
this narrowed to a 2.
4 percentage-point difference among those aged 35 to 44. among those aged 25 to 34, the proportion for women â at 90.
2 per cent marginally beat the figure for men, which was 90 per cent.
overall, literacy rates rose to 97.
1 per cent in 2020, up from 95.
9 per cent in 2010. across all age groups, multi-language literacy rates were also higher or remained stable.
there was an overall increase in english literacy across the three major ethnic groups, the dos noted.
relevance of sorting data by ethnic groupsat a press conference on the release of the data, ms indranee was asked by reporters about the continued relevance of separating data by ethnic categories, given that there may be sharp inequalities even within these groups.
ms indranee said being a multi-racial and multi-religious state is "a constant work in progress".
"(this) also means that you don't really ever get to a post-race situation where it doesn't matter at all.
"she added: "if you didn't have this data then let's say that a particular ethnic group was not doing well compared to the others.
you will have no idea how many, you will have no idea in what areas, you wouldn't know whether the problem was education, or whether the problem was something else.
"all you would have is just one big blob of data, and you will have no ability to say, actually this group is not doing so well.
what are the reasons, how can we help, what are the interventions that we can make?
""the thinking behind this data is: to the extent that any group may not be doing as well as any others in any areas, then it tells us that as a society in terms of policy, then we should do something to try and make sure that we can bridge any gap.

observing that singaporean citizens account for a greater proportion of population growth in this decade, she said: "singaporeans who wish to start and raise families remain a priority because we want to grow the singapore population, the singapore core.
"at the same time, we have to supplement our population with some immigration, because we also need to support our economy.
but that has to be very carefully calibrated.

singapore there have been 157 reports here of suspected reactions to the covid-19 vaccine severe enough to be life-threatening or result in hospitalisation, among other serious conditions.
however, no deaths have been linked to the jab, the health sciences authority (hsa) said on friday (june 11).
these "suspected serious adverse events" made up 0.
004 per cent of the almost 3.
7 million doses of pfizer-biontech and moderna jabs administered till may 23. these serious cases form part of the 4,704 "suspected adverse events reports" that hsa received till may 23. this translates into 0.
13 per cent of administered doses, which is consistent with the percentage that had been reported by the authority on may 6, when it last gave an update on the safety record of both mrna vaccines on may 6. these reactions are suspected to be associated with the vaccinations, but may not have been caused by them.
an adverse event  or reaction related to vaccination is any undesirable medical condition that occurs after taking the vaccine, which does not necessarily have a direct link to the treatment.
they may be coincidental or related to an undiagnosed disease, but have to be reported by healthcare providers to hsa.
reactions are considered serious if they result in hospitalisation, disability or life-threatening illnesses, among other things.
[[nid:522094]]anaphylaxis, which is the rapid onset of severe allergic reactions, was the most frequently reported serious adverse event, with 26 such cases.
all of them recovered after medical treatment, hsa said.
it added that the incidence rate of anaphylaxis reported here with the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines is about 0.
85 cases for every 100,000 doses of the jabs administered.
"this is similar to the incidence rates reported overseas of around 0.
5 to two per 100,000 doses administered," said hsa.
other severe allergic reactions numbered 23.  these include breathing difficulty, fast heart rate, an increase or decrease in blood pressure, chest discomfort and pain, fainting, limb numbness and weakness or pain, changes in vision, increase in liver enzymes, joint pain, fits, ringing in the ears and infections.
the authority said most of those who had developed serious adverse events have recovered or are recovering.
"these serious adverse events are being closely monitored by hsa," it added.
hsa said that the most commonly reported reactions are consistent with those typically observed following vaccination.
from the 4,704 reactions, the most common one was cases of rash, which accounted for more than one in four reported adverse events.
this was followed by cases of swelling of eyelids, face or lips, which occurred in about one in seven cases.
these are typically resolved within a few days and are in line with the events described in the covid-19 vaccines product information, as well as those reported overseas.
most of adverse events were associated with the pfizer-biontech vaccine, which was rolled out for use here on dec 30 last year and comprised 83 per cent of the doses administered.
moderna was deployed on march 12 this year.
about 68 per cent of the total number of reactions reported was among people below the age of 60. hsa pointed out that trials of the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines found that those younger than 60 tend to experience more adverse effects occurring soon after vaccination, compared with those older.
generally, younger people have more active immune responses and may experience more adverse effects to the vaccines, said hsa.
it pointed out that this is part of the body's natural response to build immunity against covid-19 infection.
the authority added that 64 per cent of these reactions were reported in females.
its update also noted that a greater frequency of heart attacks and strokes has not been observed in vaccinated persons locally.
this comes after it was announced on friday that six people have been reported to have suffered heart inflammation after receiving covid-19 vaccines four of whom were men aged below 30. as a precaution, experts have advised that vaccinated people, especially adolescents and younger men, should avoid strenuous physical activity for one week after their second dose.
"it is important to note that heart attacks and strokes can occur naturally within our population, regardless of whether people are vaccinated or not," said hsa.
"due to the large numbers of people being vaccinated, it is expected that, by coincidence, some individuals may experience other medical events such as heart attacks and strokes in the days or weeks after vaccination which may not be related to the vaccination.
"[[nid:531770]]hsa said it is monitoring the incidence of anaphylaxis and bell's palsy, which are adverse events historically reported with vaccines.
there have been 45 reported cases of bell's palsy, which causes temporary weakness or paralysis of facial muscles.
most of the cases were not serious, hsa said, and patients will generally have completely recovery even without treatment.
the incidence rate for this reaction in singapore is estimated to be 3.
35 per 100,000 persons per month.
hsa said that this is within the background incidence of 1.
1 to 4.
4 per 100,000 persons per month before the introduction of vaccination.
the authority said that it, along with the ministry of health, will continue to monitor the safety of covid-19 vaccines closely and update the public on any significant safety concerns detected with the vaccines.
overall, the benefits of the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines continue to outweigh the known risks of covid-19 disease and its severe complications in a pandemic, hsa added.

85 cases for every 100,000 doses of the jabs administered.
"this is similar to the incidence rates reported overseas of around 0.
5 to two per 100,000 doses administered," said hsa.
other severe allergic reactions numbered 23.  these include breathing difficulty, fast heart rate, an increase or decrease in blood pressure, chest discomfort and pain, fainting, limb numbness and weakness or pain, changes in vision, increase in liver enzymes, joint pain, fits, ringing in the ears and infections.
the authority said most of those who had developed serious adverse events have recovered or are recovering.
"these serious adverse events are being closely monitored by hsa," it added.
hsa said that the most commonly reported reactions are consistent with those typically observed following vaccination.
from the 4,704 reactions, the most common one was cases of rash, which accounted for more than one in four reported adverse events.
this was followed by cases of swelling of eyelids, face or lips, which occurred in about one in seven cases.
these are typically resolved within a few days and are in line with the events described in the covid-19 vaccines product information, as well as those reported overseas.
most of adverse events were associated with the pfizer-biontech vaccine, which was rolled out for use here on dec 30 last year and comprised 83 per cent of the doses administered.
moderna was deployed on march 12 this year.
about 68 per cent of the total number of reactions reported was among people below the age of 60. hsa pointed out that trials of the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines found that those younger than 60 tend to experience more adverse effects occurring soon after vaccination, compared with those older.
generally, younger people have more active immune responses and may experience more adverse effects to the vaccines, said hsa.
it pointed out that this is part of the body's natural response to build immunity against covid-19 infection.
the authority added that 64 per cent of these reactions were reported in females.
its update also noted that a greater frequency of heart attacks and strokes has not been observed in vaccinated persons locally.
this comes after it was announced on friday that six people have been reported to have suffered heart inflammation after receiving covid-19 vaccines four of whom were men aged below 30. as a precaution, experts have advised that vaccinated people, especially adolescents and younger men, should avoid strenuous physical activity for one week after their second dose.
"it is important to note that heart attacks and strokes can occur naturally within our population, regardless of whether people are vaccinated or not," said hsa.
"due to the large numbers of people being vaccinated, it is expected that, by coincidence, some individuals may experience other medical events such as heart attacks and strokes in the days or weeks after vaccination which may not be related to the vaccination.
"hsa said it is monitoring the incidence of anaphylaxis and bell's palsy, which are adverse events historically reported with vaccines.
there have been 45 reported cases of bell's palsy, which causes temporary weakness or paralysis of facial muscles.
most of the cases were not serious, hsa said, and patients will generally have completely recovery even without treatment.
the incidence rate for this reaction in singapore is estimated to be 3.
35 per 100,000 persons per month.
hsa said that this is within the background incidence of 1.
1 to 4.
4 per 100,000 persons per month before the introduction of vaccination.
the authority said that it, along with the ministry of health, will continue to monitor the safety of covid-19 vaccines closely and update the public on any significant safety concerns detected with the vaccines.
overall, the benefits of the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines continue to outweigh the known risks of covid-19 disease and its severe complications in a pandemic, hsa added.

there have been 157 reports here of suspected reactions to the covid-19 vaccines severe enough to be life-threatening or result in hospitalisation, among other serious conditions.
however, no deaths have been linked to the jab, the health sciences authority (hsa) said last friday.
these "suspected serious adverse events" made up 0.
004 per cent of the almost 3.
7 million doses of pfizer-biontech and moderna jabs administered till may 23. these serious cases form part of the 4,704 "suspected adverse event reports" that hsa received till may 23.  these translate into 0.
13 per cent of administered doses, which is consistent with the percentage that had been reported by the authority on may 6, when it last gave an update on the safety record of both mrna vaccines.
these reactions are suspected to be associated with the vaccinations, but may not have been caused by them.
an adverse event or reaction related to vaccination is any undesirable medical condition that occurs after taking the vaccine, which does not necessarily have a direct link to the treatment.
they may be coincidental or related to an undiagnosed disease, but have to be reported by healthcare providers to hsa.
reactions are considered serious if they result in hospitalisation, disability or life-threatening illnesses, among other things.
anaphylaxis, which is the rapid onset of severe allergic reactions, was the most frequently reported serious adverse event, with 26 such cases.
all of them recovered after medical treatment, hsa said.
it added that the incidence rate of anaphylaxis reported here with the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines is about 0.
85 cases for every 100,000 doses administered.
"this is similar to the incidence rates reported overseas of around 0.

singapore employers here have no legal power to force staff members to disclose their covid-19 vaccination status or demand that they get inoculated.
experts and employers noted that while vaccination is strongly encouraged in singapore, it remains voluntary, although there are several ways people can be encouraged to get a jab.
these will come more into focus as singapore begins rolling out covid-19 vaccinations to the wider population, with bookings open to singaporeans aged 12 to 39 from friday (june 11).
singapore human resources institute (shri) president low peck kem told the straits times that unless there is a business need, employers should not compel staff to disclose if they have had a jab or take punitive action against those who do not get inoculated or refuse to update their vaccination status.
"even if there is a strong business need, such as needing to know in order to determine if the employee can travel for business or to deploy to higher-risk front-line facing roles, do explain clearly why the company needs to know the status and generally, most employees will comply," she said.
institute for human resource professionals (ihrp) chief executive mayank parekh said that bosses should not use non-vaccination as a reason to terminate employment as there could be medical reasons for why a staff member did not get a shot.
mr tan wei ming, senior associate at law firm cms holborn asia, said that if employers want to keep records on vaccinated employees that contain personal data such as names, they must do so in accordance with the personal data protection act and other applicable data protection laws.
"for these reasons, companies in singapore are unlikely to make their employees declare their vaccination status at this juncture," he added.
wongpartnership joint head of employment practice jenny tsin said staff members should not face discrimination arising from their vaccination status, given that its voluntary.
however, there could be circumstances that warrant a different approach, such as for jobs involving higher risk of exposure to covid-19, she added.
in this instance, it could be more justified to limit return to the workplace to only vaccinated employees.
investment bank goldman sachs recently ordered its employees in the united states to report their covid-19 vaccination status as part of their plans to return to the office, afp reported on thursday.
st understands that goldman sachs is not requiring staff here to report their vaccination status, and that most are still working from home.
while professional services firm ey strongly encourages its eligible staff to get vaccinated, it does not require them to declare their status given that immunisation is not mandatory, said the singapore and brunei managing partner max loh.
uob human resources head dean tong said the bank has been encouraging staff in critical roles to get vaccinated since the government announced its roll-out to essential workers in the financial sector in march.
st understands that uob does not track the vaccination status of employees.
meanwhile, sembcorp industries has introduced an app that provides voluntary updates on a person's vaccination status.
the app, which was developed in-house, is also used to obtain online approval for essential facility visits.
an amazon spokesman said that the company's employees and associates are generally not required to declare their vaccination status, except for staff members who are travelling to singapore from overseas.
the firm also provides a cash benefit to front-line employees and associates who are paid by the hour when they get their vaccination off-site.
shri's ms low and mr parekh from ihrp said employers can encourage immunisation by communicating the benefits to their staff as well as incentivising vaccination through means such as time off after getting the jabs and giving workers a care package.
mr samir bedi, asean workforce advisory leader at ey, noted that it would not be surprising to see employers including vaccination as a pre-requisite in job descriptions in future, particularly for front-line positions that require face-to-face interactions.
"this not only protects employees and their families, but also ensures the public's safety.
employees who travel for work may also need to comply with pre-travel vaccination travel regulations," he said.
but companies must remain inclusive and consider the needs of individuals who may not be able to get vaccinated due to health reasons, mr bedi said.
he added: "this requires employers to continue with precautionary safe workplace measures while ensuring equal career opportunities for all.
