singapore four young men in singapore had heart inflammation after receiving their second dose of covid-19 vaccine.
the men aged 18 to 30 have all recovered from myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart), said the country's expert committee on the covid-19 vaccination in a statement on friday night (june 11).
most of the cases were reported to have occurred within a few days after the second jab.
this is out of a total of six such cases reported by the health sciences authority (hsa).
however, the benefits of getting a covid-19 jab outweigh the risks, said the expert committee.
as a precaution, the expert panel said vaccinated people, especially adolescents and younger men, should avoid strenuous physical activity for one week after their second dose.
during this period, they should seek medical attention if they develop chest pain, shortness of breath or abnormal heartbeats, it said.
"most cases are mild, recover without the need for significant intervention and do not suffer any long-term effects, although very rarely, severe cases may result in damage to the heart muscles," said the expert committee.
"our assessment is that the benefits of receiving the mrna covid-19 vaccines the reduction in covid-19 infections and severe complications even if infected continue to outweigh the risks of vaccination.
"the four cases reported by the hsa are aged between 18 and 30, and had their symptoms a few days after receiving the second dose of an mrna-based vaccine.
both covid-19 vaccines in singapore by pfizer-biontech and moderna use such technology.
all four men have recovered or have been discharged from hospital.
the expert committee added that the four cases here are at "the upper end of the expected range of this age group, based on background incidence rates".
"while further studies and investigations are ongoing, the currently available data suggests that there may be a very small risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after the second dose of an mrna vaccine, particularly in young men," it said.
the expert committee also said that heart inflammation following the second dose of the vaccine has been observed in israel and the united states in men below 25. the risk is estimated to be at 1.
6 cases per 100,000 doses in the us.
it added that there has been no increased risk associated with the first dose of the vaccine, and that the condition is generally more common in men than women.
in may, it was reported that 20 cases of anaphylaxis a severe life-threatening allergic reaction had happened in singapore in relation to the covid-19 vaccine.
in a separate update, the hsa said cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported with covid-19 vaccines both overseas and locally.
myocarditis and pericarditis have many causes and most are due to viral infections and immunological reactions, it said, and in most cases, the inflammation is mild.
the authority has received six reports of myocarditis and pericarditis, of which four were in men younger than 30 years.
"hsa will continue to monitor this potential safety issue closely," it added.

six cases, four involving men aged between 18 to 30 years old, have been reported in singapore.
singapore: there may be a "very small risk" of heart inflammation after the second dose of an mrna covid-19 vaccine, said the government-appointed expert committee on covid-19 vaccination in singapore.
in a media release on friday (jun 11), the committee said it is closely monitoring international reports that the second dose of mrna covid-19 vaccines may be associated with a small risk of myocarditis and pericarditis in young men.
myocarditis and pericarditis are inflammatory conditions that affect the heart muscles and the outer lining of the heart respectively.
increased occurrences of myocarditis and pericarditis after the second dose of mrna covid-19 vaccinations have been observed in israel and the united states, and in adolescents and young men younger than 25 years.
singapore uses the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines for its national vaccination programme.
both are mrna-based vaccines.
in a separate update, the health sciences authority (hsa) said israel, which uses the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine, recently announced that there may be a probable link between the second dose and the onset of myocarditis in men aged between 16 and 30 years old in its population.
the link was found stronger among the younger age group of 16 to 19 years old.
while no other country has highlighted a similar causal link to date, the us centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) has reported that it has observed more cases of myocarditis and pericarditis in male patients aged between 16 and 24 years old.
"nonetheless, they have stressed that investigations are ongoing, and they have not made any conclusion about a causal link," said hsa.
most cases are "mild", six such reports received by hsamyocarditis and pericarditis occur more often in men compared to women.
symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath or abnormal heartbeats.
most cases are mild and patients recover without the need for significant intervention, nor do they suffer from any long-term effects.
the expert committee added that very rarely, severe cases may result in damage to the heart muscles.
the two conditions are separate and distinct from heart attacks, which are caused when the blood flow to the heart is blocked.
in singapore, hsa said it has received six such reports as of jun 7.  two of the cases involved a man and a woman older than 40 years old.
the other four cases involved men aged between 18 and 30 years old.
"(the four cases) are at the upper end of the expected range for this age group, based on background incidence rates," said hsa.
most of the cases were reported to have occurred within a few days after receiving the second dose of the vaccine.
all have recovered or have been discharged well from the hospital.
although the local numbers are small, the pattern of occurrence after the second covid-19 vaccine and in young men is consistent with what has been observed in the us and israel, which are the two major users of the mrna vaccines, said hsa.
those who developed myocarditis and pericarditis responded well to treatment and recovered, added hsa.
"overall, the benefits of the pfizer-biontech and moderna covid-19 vaccines continue to outweigh the known risks of covid-19 disease and its severe complications in a pandemic," it added.
the authority has also informed the ministry of health (moh) and the expert committee of its assessment.
"we will also continue to monitor this closely and take the relevant and necessary regulatory actions," said hsa.
the committee said it has reviewed the available international and local data.
"our assessment is that the benefits of receiving the mrna covid-19 vaccines, i. e. , reduction in covid-19 infections and severe complications even if infected, continue to outweigh the risks of vaccination.

they should also seek medical attention promptly if they develop chest pain, shortness of breath or abnormal heartbeats.
"covid-19 continues to be a health threat globally and in singapore.
"the emergence of infectious variants can lead to widespread community covid-19 transmission as well as the risk of severe covid-19 disease and complications, including long term chronic complications," said the committee.
it that the benefits of mrna covid-19 vaccination continue to outweigh the known and potential risks.
hsa and moh will also continue to monitor the safety profile of the covid-19 vaccines closely and update members of the public of any significant safety concerns detected with the vaccines.

washington (reuters) a higher-than-expected number of young men have experienced heart inflammation after their second dose of the mrna covid-19 shots from pfizer/biontech and moderna, according to data from two vaccine safety monitoring systems, the us centres for disease control and prevention (cdc) said on thursday (june 10).
the cdc and other health regulators have been investigating heart inflammation cases after israel's health ministry reported that it had found a likely link to the condition in young men who received pfizer's covid-19 vaccine.
the agency said it is still assessing the risk from the condition and has not yet concluded that there was a causal relationship between the vaccines and cases of myocarditis or pericarditis.
while some patients required hospitalisation, most have fully recovered from their symptoms, the cdc said.
more than half of the cases reported to the us vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers) after people had received their second dose of either the pfizer/biontech or moderna vaccines were in people between the ages of 12 and 24, the cdc said.
those age groups accounted for less than 9 per cent of doses administered.
"we clearly have an imbalance there," dr tom shimabukuro, deputy director of the cdc's immunisation safety office, said in a presentation to an advisory committee to the us food and drug administration meeting on thursday.
the overwhelming majority of the cases have occurred within a week of vaccination, shimabukuro said.
there were 283 observed cases of heart inflammation after the second vaccine dose in those aged 16 to 24 in the vaers data.
that compares with expectations of 10-to-102 cases for that age range based on us population background incidence rates, the cdc said.
shimabukuro said there was a predominance of males in younger age groups among the reported heart inflammation cases.
the median age of patients who experienced the inflammation after a second vaccine dose was 24, according to the vaers data.
just under 80 per cent of the cases were in men.
shimabukuro also said the vaccine safety datalink (vsd) another safety monitoring system – showed an increased incidence of heart inflammation in 16 to 39 year olds after their second shot when compared to the rate observed after the first dose.
pfizer said it supports the cdc's assessment of the heart inflammation cases, noting that "the number of reports is small given the number of doses administered.
"about 130 million people in the united states have received both doses of one of the mrna vaccines.
"it is important to understand that a careful assessment of the reports is ongoing and it has not been concluded that the mrna covid-19 vaccines cause myocarditis or pericarditis," the company said in a statement.
moderna said it also has not established a causal association with the condition and its vaccine.
it said it is actively working with public health and regulatory authorities to further assess the issue.
the cdc said it will hold a meeting of its advisory committee on immunisation practices next week to further evaluate the evidence and assess the risk of myocarditis following mrna vaccination for covid-19.
