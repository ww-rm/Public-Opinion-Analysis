the second nationwide home-based learning (hbl) exercise for students will come to an end in stages, the ministry of education (moe) announced yesterday.
primary 4 to 6 pupils, secondary 3 to 5 and all junior college and millennia institute students will be the first to return to school on june 28.  secondary 1 and 2 students will return to school from july 1 and the rest will go back from july 6. those sitting psle and n-, o- and a-level examinations this year have had to live with the coronavirus for more than a year now and been forced to make unprecedented adjustments while preparing for the milestone tests.
dr jason tan, associate professor in the policy, curriculum and leadership academic group at the national institute of education, said negotiating two hbl sessions and adjusting to various safety measures both in and out of school would have been challenging.
"these exams play an important role in determining the next stages of the students' lives and having them amid the disruptions caused by the virus is certainly not ideal," he told the new paper yesterday.
"this period is already a stressful one for them, knowing the importance of these exams.
faced with social isolation like being apart from their classmates and not having co-curricular activities is bound to affect their social and emotional well-being, which also plays a part in how they do academically.
"on may 16, moe announced that all students would move to hbl from may 19, the second such exercise since the virus appeared here early last year.
the current mid-year holidays started on may 29 and end on june 27. last year's hbl was from april 8 to may 5, during the circuit breaker, when singapore went into a lockdown from april 7 to june 1. ms vivien le, founder of le xue education group, a chinese education centre, believes many of the students taking crucial exams this year would have found it tough.
the former moe teacher said: "this year's cohort had to go through two rounds of disruptions.
"students who find it more challenging learning online may find it difficult since a portion of their syllabus from these two years were taught online, especially when it comes to the foundation topics taught last year.
"but she noted that some learning styles may be suited to online learning.
miss ren yun ting, 18, a second-year student at tampines meridian junior college, said she was productive during the recent hbl exercise as she continued preparing for her upcoming a-level exams.
she said: "the school uploaded a lot of information and resources such as mock exam papers for us to do, and i had the flexibility to plan my time on how i wanted to revise.
"while she missed meeting her friends and having fun in school, the time she saved on travelling and attending co-curricular activity sessions helped with revision work.
"i may not be able to say i am 100 per cent confident to take the exams now, but i am definitely making great use of my holidays to consolidate my learning, and i am well prepared for my upcoming exams, which is an important milestone before the a levels," she added.
some have struggled more.
madam lunny liu, 50, a tutor, said her 11-year-old daughter, who will sit the primary school leaving examination later this year, found the hbl less effective.
"she never had very good self-discipline and home-based learning made it worse.
also, it affected her understanding of some lessons taught in class because she does better with physical interaction.
"students taking the psle and n-, o- and a-level exams face huge pressure, and ms le said the pandemic could exacerbate the strain.
a mother who wanted to be known only as mrs lim said despite the challenges that her 12-year-old daughter has had to face, they have learnt to adapt as the psle draws closer.
the 41-year-old sales manager said: "last year, my daughter was complaining about the safe management measures in school such as having to wear masks the whole day.
"she does not complain now and is looking forward to returning to school to prepare for her exams.
"while it has been disruptive, especially when tuition classes were shifted online, this pandemic has taught us to go with the flow and expect these constant changes.

singapore home-based learning (hbl) has been challenging for parents especially those juggling busy work schedules but they understand the need for caution in the ministry of education's (moe) move to progressively allow students back to school after the june holidays.
moe had announced the move on monday (june 14), adding that the aim is to keep students and staff safe from covid-19.
from june 28, when term 3 begins, primary 1 to 3 pupils will continue with a week of hbl.
they will return to school on tuesday, july 6, as monday is a school holiday.
secondary 1 and 2 students will also be on hbl for three days till june 30, and return to school on thursday, july 1. students in primary 4 to 6, secondary 3 to 5, junior colleges and the millennia institute will return to school on june 28. parents the straits times spoke to on tuesday welcomed the move, though some noted that there could be challenges that could be stressful for both parents and children.
mrs joanna tan, 41, feels the staggered return is a good way to reassure parents of their children's safety.
"younger children tend to get excited to see their friends on the first day back at school (which could lead to them not keeping to safe distancing measures)," she said.
having one week of hbl could help them to adjust back to school without such risks, said the housewife, who has a son in primary 6 and a daughter in primary 2. but another parent, ms carmen li, 38, said hbl can be challenging and has "added extra stress to both parent and child".
she has an intense work schedule, she said, and it has been difficult to rush her own work while giving her primary 3 daughter attention or technical support when needed.
"primary 3 children are still dependent on their parents," said, ms li, who works in human resources.
she added that her daughter uses her phone at times to call her teacher.
"i need to be on standby for her if she cannot get through homework.
it is almost like i need to be right next to her.
"ms li said she hopes schools can suggest a self-directed timetable for children beyond school to support parents in dealing with their children's social needs and fight boredom.
mr elgin teng, 39, whose daughter is in primary 1, said he was not surprised to hear of the move, given the trend in community cases and how the end of the june holidays was approaching.
said mr teng, a learning and development consultant, of his daughter: "she gets to spend more time with the family and learn about.
.
.
how we make a living.
we also get to spend more time together over meals, so we see that as a good thing for her, although not so much for us parents because we now need to multitask.
"the homework load is not too heavy in primary 1, but the challenge is when the work is done and his daughter starts to seek parental attention, mr teng added.
"the school is a valuable place for every child to grow in their social awareness, relationship management and face-to-face interactions.
.
.
a shorter hbl might be healthier as a child's well-being needs to be extended into the space of physical interactions and also parents' space for mental rest.
"mr graham teo, 42, who has a child in secondary 1, also noted that while each singaporean has a part to play in keeping the country safe, "an integral part of going to school is the social interaction with friends and teachers".
learning and working from home will be a part of the future, and schools are doing well under the circumstances, said mr teo, who works in procurement.
"however, with more hbl, teachers and parents need to understand that close partnership is now more crucial than ever.
both sides should reach out to each other instead of it being a one-sided effort.
"he added: "part of the fun of going to school is meeting and interacting with friends.
we also need to pick up social skills, and there is no better place than school to do it in. "

singapore: teachers are reaching out to parents and students who have not responded to invitations to take the covid-19 vaccination to offer assistance if needed, said second minister for education maliki osman on monday (jun 14).
"it could be an issue where the parents do not know how to (sign up).
it could be an issue that they are not quite familiar with the online system," he said, speaking to reporters at a vaccination centre at ite college west.
"it could also be parents have some concerns about safety.
so for that, we are asking our teachers to reach out to them.
"giving updates on thestudent vaccination exercise, dr maliki said that 345,000 text messages and invites have been sent out to eligible parents and students.
as of sunday, 300,000 students have registered and booked their slots for their vaccination.
of these students, 101,000 have received their first dose, he added.
among students from the graduating cohorts, who were the first batch of students to receive invites, 90 per cent have registered for the vaccination and 75 per cent of them have received their first doses, said dr maliki.
some parents may face challenges taking their children to the vaccination centres, such as those who are working and have younger children to care for, said dr maliki.
"for those groups, we assure them that all they need to do is when school reopens, they can get in touch with the schools, get in touch with the teachers, and the schools are ready to help facilitate bringing some of the students together perhaps to a vaccination centre, or creating better transportation facilities for them to do so," he added.
"we are still reaching out to all those who have not signed up, who have not registered, and we look forward to them understanding the support that's available for the students to be getting their vaccinations.
"monday was also the first day of vaccinations for ite students.
about nine in 10 of them have registered for the vaccination exercise, said dr maliki.
at ite college west, about 280 students took their first dose of the covid-19 vaccine on monday morning.
there are 28,000 ite students across singapore, and they can register for the vaccination directly through their schools for the centre set up in their respective colleges, said dr maliki.
all three ite college vaccination centres are open, and the fourth moe vaccination centre at raffles city convention centre will start operations on tuesday.
the education ministry hopes all students can receive their second dose by the end of august, "but that all depends" on the response rate, said dr maliki.
"it's very encouraging today.
by and large, we have about 80 to 90 per cent of responses for the different categories, and we hope more will step forward," he added.
responding to a question about whether vaccinated and non-vaccinated students will be subject to different measures when they return to school, dr maliki said: "the last thing we want is for students to be identified as 'you have been vaccinated' and 'you have not been vaccinated', because we do not want a situation where one becomes stigmatised for not being vaccinated.
"certainly, we have to respect decisions by parents, whether they would like their children to be vaccinated or not.
we hope that the environment is one where everyone in the school feels safer, now that the majority would have had their vaccination by the time they resume school at the end of june.
"dr maliki added that schools will continue to adhere to safe management measures like practising hygiene and cleanliness standards, safe distancing and the wearing of masks.
"we will continue to take guidance from the mtf (multi-ministry task force) with regard to the measures that we put in place at the national level and schools will respond accordingly," he said.

singapore vaccination has begun for all institute of technical education (ite) students on monday (june 14) now that three out of four ministry of education vaccination centres have opened.
vaccination centre operations started at ite college central in ang mo kio on june 7, at ite college east in simei on june 9 and at ite college west in choa chu kang on june 11.  the fourth centre, at raffles city convention centre, will open on tuesday.
more than 300,000 students across singapore have registered for their vaccination appointments thus far, of whom over 101,000 have taken their first dose, said second education minister maliki osman.
about 345,000 smses and invites had been sent to eligible students.
dr maliki gave reporters an update on student vaccination numbers during a visit to ite college west in choa chu kang on monday.
"our first batch, our graduating students, about 90 per cent of them have already registered, and about 75 per cent received their first doses.
"it's very encouraging to see how the students are responding to all these invitations and smses that have been given to them.
"the hope is that all students will be able to get fully vaccinated by the end of august, dr maliki added, although this will depend on the response rate.
schools are contacting parents of students who did not respond to the vaccination bulletins to find out more about their concerns, he said.
"it could be an issue where the parents may not know how to (register).
.
.
that they are not quite familiar with the online system.
"it could also be that parents have some concerns about issues of safety and so for that, we are asking teachers to reach out to them," he said.
some working parents may also face challenges in getting their children, especially the younger ones, to the vaccination centres.
"so for those groups, we can assure them that all they need to do is when school reopens, get in touch with the teachers.
"the schools are ready to help, for example, with transport arrangements, he said.
the new school term starts on june 28. it was earlier announced that singapore would roll out its vaccination exercise to more than 400,000 students in schools and institutes of higher learning, including autonomous universities, polytechnics and ite, amid more covid-19 infections among children.
those affected included students in primary and secondary schools, junior colleges, the millennia institute, madrasahs, special education schools, and the international arms of hwa chong institution, anglo-chinese school and st joseph's institution.
students had been invited to sign up for vaccination slots from june 1, starting with about 56,000 students who will be sitting major examinations like the o and a levels this year.
those aged 18 and above can opt for either the pfizer-biontech or moderna vaccine, while those aged between 12 and 17 will be offered only the pfizer jab as the moderna vaccine has not been approved for use on this younger age group.

dr maliki said the ite centres will be able to administer 1,600 doses of the vaccine a day, while the raffles city centre can do 2,000 doses a day.
this week, the three centres will provide vaccinations for ite students in the morning from 8.
30am to 11.
30am, and for all other students from 1.
30pm to 4.

from next week, the centres will be open to all students.

dr maliki also reiterated that vaccinating students is one of the many protective measures in place to ensure their safety, with the majority of students expected to receive the first dose of their vaccine by end-june when school reopens.
however, safe management measures such as mask wearing, safe distancing and staggered recess times will continue to prevail.
business student danial norizam, 16, was among the ite students vaccinated on monday morning.
he told the straits times that he was a little anxious about the side effects initially, but felt that it was important to get his vaccine in order to keep himself safe.
both his parents, who have already been vaccinated, had also encouraged him to do so.

paris: novak djokovic captured his second french open title as he recovered from being outplayed for two sets by stefanos tsitsipas to win 6-7(6) 2-6 6-3 6-2 6-4 victory on sunday (jun 13).
djokovic's seismic semi-final win over 13-times champion rafa nadal looked like being in vain as an inspired tsitsipas moved to the brink of becoming greece's first grand slam champion.
after failing to convert a set point in an enthralling 72-minute opener full of brutal rallies and then crumbling in surprising fashion in the second set, djokovic looked drained.
his hopes of banking a 19th grand slam title were hanging by a thread but he rediscovered his mojo in the nick of time to turn the match around in emphatic fashion.
the 34-year-old, who won his first french crown in 2016, rattled through the third and fourth sets as tsitsipas, playing in his first grand slam final, struggled to maintain the intensity that had put him in charge.
fifth seed tsitsipas appeared to be struggling physically but valiantly tried to dig in at the start of the fifth set as the shadows spread across a sunlit court philippe chatrier.
but djokovic got the early break in the decider and although he was pushed hard, he was never threatened again.
there were nerves as he served at 5-4, netting an easy volley and then seeing a tsitsipas backhand flash past him on championship point.
but djokovic would not be denied as he claimed victory by angling away another volley at the second time of asking after four hours 11 minutes.
in moving just one behind the record of 20 shared by nadal and roger federer, djokovic became the first player in the professional era to win each grand slam title at least twice.
"it was again an electric atmosphere.
nine hours of tennis in less than 48 hours," djokovic said on court.
"it's not easy; physically and mentally it was very, very difficult for me, these three days.
i believed in my capacities and in my game.
it's a dream come true.
"djokovic earned his 19th grand slam title the hard way.
not only did he inflict only a third ever defeat on nadal, he also became the first player in the professional era to win a grand slam title having twice come back from a two sets down, having also found himself staring at defeat against lorenzo musetti in the fourth round.
there was no easing in to his first grand slam final for tsitsipas who had to save two break points in his opening service game, one with a backhand and one with an ace.
rock solidtsistipas settled quickly, however, marking out his territory with his backhand looking rock solid.
favourite djokovic was thrown off his stride when he took a heavy tumble chasing down a drop shot at 3-3 and the serb found himself in trouble at 4-5, framing a forehand high into the stands to hand tsistipas a set point.
the players traded backhands but djokovic produced a clever angle to save fend off the set point.
he then served for the set at 6-5 but produced a poor game and a tiebreak was needed to separate them.
it was djokovic who looked to be feeling the strain as he double-faulted on the way to falling 4-0 behind.
but he regrouped and produced a sensational drop volley at 3-5 before forging 6-5 ahead only to see his set point whipped away by a fizzing tsitsipas forehand.
djokovic then shunted a backhand wide to hand tsitsipas a second set point and this time the greek took advantage as djokovic's forehand misfired.
there was a hint of despondency in djokovic's body language and tsitsipas sensed it, seizing control of the match to dominate the second set after breaking early.
djokovic netted a forehand to fall 2-5 down and offered scant resistance as tsitsipas held to take a two-set.
just as against musetti in the fourth round, the backlash was instant.
djokovic began striking the ball more aggressively and closer to the lines and he engineered five break points in an energy-sapping fourth game eventually converting for a 3-1 lead when the greek missed a backhand down the line.
after winning the third set djokovic carried the momentum into the fourth and tsitsipas, who had some treatment on his lower back, appeared to be crumbling as he dropped serve twice.
the crowd tries to spur tsitsipas on in the fifth but there was no escape as djokovic rolled to victory.

novak djokovic didn't throw his racket to the sky after rallying for a five-set victory in the french open final.
he didn't tuck it away as a cherished souvenir, either.
instead, djokovic walked over to the roland garros stands and handed it to a youngster who was part coach, part fan and all heart during the match with stefanos tsitsipas.
the boy was delirious with disbelief and joy, the moment one of those purely celebratory sports encounters between superstar and fan.
afterward, djokovic explained that his gesture was a reward to a fan who had remained in his corner even when he lost the first two sets and appeared headed for defeat.
he didn't say it, but perhaps it was also djokovic's acknowledgment that he isn't always a fan favorite.
"i don't know the boy, but he was in my ear the entire match, basically.
especially when i was two-sets-to-love down, he was encouraging me; he was actually giving me tactics as well," djokovic told reporters with a laugh.
"he was like: 'hold your serve.
get an easy first ball and then dictate.
go to his backhand.
'novak djokovic battles back in french open final for 19th grand slam win"he was coaching me, literally, and i found that very cute and very nice.
to give the racket to the best person — it was him — after the match, that was kind of my gratitude for him sticking with me and supporting me.
"djokovic secured his 19th grand slam win — and his second of 2021 — and will try at wimbledon to tie the record of 20 held by roger federer and rafael nadal.

paris: stefanos tsitsipas has learnt the hard way over the last two months that novak djokovic and rafa nadal will take some shifting from the top of the men's game.
the greek led world number one djokovic by two sets in the french open final on sunday, but still ended up losing and it has become a familiar feeling to be so close and yet so far.
tsitsipas led djokovic in the rome masters quarter-finals this year, but lost.
he also pushed 13-time french open champion nadal to three tight sets in the barcelona open final, but again fell short.
the 22-year-old, who was looking to become the first greek player to win a grand slam title, is, however, confident that he is on the right path to break the dominance of the two players who have won 11 of the last 12 majors.
"i'm able to play for titles like this.
despite my loss today, i have faith in my game.
i very much believe i can get to that point very soon," tsitsipas told reporters after his 6-7(6) 2-6 6-3 6-2 6-4 defeat on court philippe chatrier.
"i was close today.
every opponent is difficult.
there's a small difference between the player i played today and the ones from before.
"but i think with the same attitude and the same if i don't downgrade myself, i see no reason for me not to be holding that trophy one day.
"on sunday, he was left to wonder how djokovic had turned his game around after losing the second set.
"what i learned today is that no matter what, in order for the match to be finished, you have to win three sets and not two.
two sets doesn't really mean anything.
it's still one away from winning the entire match," said tsitsipas.
"i don't think i changed much.
i just kept the same pace.
i kept the things that were working for me.
but it ended up, i don't know, he left the court after two sets to love down, i don't know what happened there, but he came back to me like a different player suddenly.
"djokovic took an off-court break after the loss of the second set and when he returned, the match was a different affair altogether.
asked if he felt that djokovic was physically much better all of a sudden, tsitsipas said: "felt physically, anticipation maybe, just movement on the court, everything felt much more fresh and much better than before.
"i don't know.
i kind of felt like he could read my game a bit better suddenly.
good for him.
he did well to get there.

serbia's novak djokovic celebrates with the trophy after winning the french open against greece's stefanos tsitsipas at roland garros, paris june 13, 2021.

paris, june 14 — for the second time in six years novak djokovic is halfway to a calendar year sweep of all four grand slam titles after winning the french open for a second time on sunday.
the 34-year-old dug deep into his reserves of resilience to hit back from two sets down against greece's stefanos tsitsipas to win 6-7(6) 2-6 6-3 6-2 6-4 and increase his grand slam tally to 19. that takes him only one behind the men's record 20 held by rafa nadal and roger federer and there is nothing to suggest the world number one will not surpass his two career rivals.
he can already claim something neither of those two can, after his win over the 22-year-old tsitsipas made him the first player in the professional era to win each of the four grand slams at least twice.
having already claimed the australian open this year, he has a shot at becoming the first man to win all four majors in the same year since rod laver in 1969 and he could even complete a 'golden slam' by adding the olympic title in tokyo.
"everything is possible," djokovic told reporters.
"i've achieved some things that a lot of people thought it would be not possible for me to achieve.
everything is possible, and i did put myself in a good position to go for the golden slam.
but, you know, i was in this position in 2016 as well.
"it ended up in a third-round loss in wimbledon.
"wimbledon returns later this month after last year's tournament was cancelled because of the pandemic.
djokovic won it in 2019 and will be the favourite to add a sixth title on the grass, after which he will turn his thoughts to the olympic games and the us open.
"obviously i will enjoy this win and then think about wimbledon in a few days' time.
i don't have an issue to say that i'm going for the title in wimbledon," he said.
"of course i am.
i won in '18 and '19 there.
hopefully i can keep that run going.
"as far as chasing down federer and nadal, djokovic said he has always considered it a possibility despite the fact that when he won his second grand slam title at the 2011 australian open, nadal had nine and federer was on 16.
"i never thought it was a mission impossible to reach the grand slams of these guys," djokovic said.
"i mean, i'm not there, but it's one less.
but they are still playing.
"obviously they're playing great, especially rafa with his level.
we all have still opportunities at wimbledon, all the other slams.
i'll keep on going.
i'll keep on chasing.
at the same time i'll keep on paving my own path.
"his long-time coach marian vajda joked after sunday's comeback win that he and goran ivanisevic, who is also part of the team, would retire if djokovic won the calendar slam.
"i think it is possible, much more possible.
he loves to play in wimbledon and us open," he told reporters.
"as much as novak is healthy, and he's healthy right now, he's in great shape, i think he has ability to win the grand slam for this year.
i'm pretty sure.
"it did not look likely when djokovic trailed by two sets against an inspired tsitsipas on sunday — the effort of beating nadal in a seismic semi-final appearing to catch up on him.
but djokovic said some words of wisdom from a young fan helped him out.
"i don't know the boy.
he was in my ear the entire match basically, especially when i was two sets to love down.
he was encouraging me.
he was actually giving me tactics," djokovic, who presented the excited fan with his racket at the end, said.
"he was like, 'hold your serve, get an easy first ball, then dictate, go to his backhand'.
he was coaching me literally.
i found that very cute, very nice. "

paris: after dethroning 'king of clay' rafa nadal at the french open, novak djokovic will next face a first-time grand slam finalist in stefanos tsitsipas as the world number one bids to become the first man in the open era to win all four majors at least twice.
roy emerson and rod laver are the only men to have won each of the four grand slams on two or more occasions but no one has achieved the feat since 1968, when the sport allowed professional players to compete at the majors.
a second trophy at roland garros, after his 2016 triumph on the red clay, on sunday will also give the 34-year-old serbian his 19th grand slam title one short of nadal and roger federer's men's record.
his challenger will be a 22-year-old who is bidding to become the first greek to win a singles major.
tsitsipas has long been marked out as a future grand slam champion and has already collected trophies from the season-ending atp finals and a masters 1000 tournament.
but he had drawn a blank the three times he reached the last-four stage at a major before friday's semi-final where he took down u. s.  open finalist alexander zverev in a thrilling five-set duel.
the first grand slam finalist from greece will arrive on court philippe chatrier on sunday with a 2-5 win-loss record against the serbian but will draw inspiration from the fact that he has a tour-leading win tally in 2021.
"i'm looking forward to that challenge," tsitsipas said on friday, looking ahead to his first major final.
"i'm looking forward to bring my game to kind of challenge myself to step it up.
"nothing less than his 'a' game would suffice for the greek as he has never managed to defeat djokovic on clay though he took the serbian to five sets in the semi-finals at the same venue last year.
the emotions of friday's fantastic win over 13-time french open winner nadal might leave a hangover for most players but that might not be a problem for djokovic with his incredible mental strength.
"it's not the first time that i play an epic semi-final in a grand slam and then i have to come back in less than 48 hours and play finals," he said.
"my recovery abilities are pretty good, i must say, throughout my career .
.
.
i know what i need to do.
"djokovic was happy to relax a bit and enjoy his semi-final win over his great rival but will not take anything for granted against the greek.
"he's in great form," the serbian said.
"i think he matured as a player a lot.
clay (is) arguably his best surface.
"we played an epic five-setter last year in the semis here.
yeah, i know it's going to be another tough one.
"i'm hoping i can recharge my batteries as much as i can because i'm going to need some power and energy for that one.

															afp paris novak djokovic can become the first man in 52 years to win all four grand slam titles twice in the french open final on sunday after conquering rafael nadal, the 'mount everest' of roland garros.
world number one djokovic takes on greece's stefanos tsitsipas for the title with tennis history on the line.
victory for the serb will take him alongside roy emerson and rod laver as the only men to capture the four majors more than once.
it's an achievement that has proved even beyond the capabilities of nadal and roger federer.
it is so rare an accomplishment that it hasn't happened since 1969 when laver completed his second calendar grand slam.
djokovic can pocket a 19th slam with victory and move just one behind the record of 20 jointly held by nadal and federer.
djokovic insists there will be no letdown physically or emotionally after reaching the final in paris for a sixth time with an epic triumph over 13-time champion nadal.
"it's not the first time that i play an epic semi-final in a grand slam and then i have to come back in less than 48 hours and play finals," said the 34-year-old.
"my recovery abilities have been pretty good throughout my career.
"his four-hour, four-set battle with nadal is already jostling for a prime spot in the list of "greatest ever matches" at the slams.
'never believed' -it featured a lung-busting 92-minute third set and required government intervention to allow the 5,000 fans inside court philippe chatrier to watch the match's conclusion despite it extending beyond the 11pm covid-19 curfew.
the 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 triumph gave djokovic the honour of being the only man to have beaten nadal in paris more than once, having first achieved it in the 2015 quarter-finals.
nadal has only lost three times in 108 matches since his title-winning debut in 2005. djokovic, the 2016 champion, said it was his best win in paris and ranked it among his "three greatest" ever performances.
"it's hard to find words bigger than all the superlatives you can think of for rafa's achievements at roland garros," said djokovic who now leads their series 30-28 and had lost three finals in the french capital to nadal.
"each time you step on the court with him, you know that you have to kind of climb mount everest to win against this guy here.
"djokovic has already admitted he's a fan of tsitsipas, proclaiming him as a grand slam champion in the making.
"he is a hard worker, dedicated, nice guy," said djokovic.
"he's very smart and wise.
i love the fact that he is more than just a tennis player and he's always looking to learn from experience and to understand something new about himself.
"that's the trait of a champion.
"djokovic will be playing in his 29th slam final on sunday.
he holds a 5-2 record over tsitsipas, a run which includes all three meetings on clay.
at last year's roland garros, djokovic won their semi-final over five sets.
"we played an epic five-setter last year in the semis here.
i know it's going to be another tough one," added djokovic who also defeated tsitsipas in rome on the eve of the french open.
"i'm hoping i can recharge my batteries as much as i can because i'm going to need some power and energy for that one.
"tsitsipas, 22, and 12 years younger than the serb, is in his first slam final having ended a run of three semi-final losses by defeating alexander zverev over five sets on friday.
victory on sunday would make him the first greek player to win a slam title.
he would also become the youngest champion in paris since nadal in 2008 and overall at the slams since juan martin del potro at the 2009 us open.
"i've never believed, have never really thought at what age this achievement might come," said tsitsipas.
"but i'm really happy with myself.
i think i've shown good discipline so far.
i've been progressive.
"tsitsipas is the hottest player on tour in 2021 with a season-leading 39 wins.
twenty-two of those have come on clay and have reaped a masters title in monte carlo as well as lyon.
tsitsipas also had a match point in the barcelona final against eventual champion nadal.
"there is the final on sunday, which is exciting.
i'm looking forward to leaving my entire body on the court," said the greek who knocked out second seed daniil medvedev in the quarter-finals.
heavy to very heavy rain is expected in the north and northeast of thailand on sunday due to tropical storm "koguma", the thai meteorological department announced in its 5am weather bulletin.
paris: after flying into the financial turbulence of the covid pandemic, the airline sector expects passenger traffic to take off despite concerns about the industry's impact on climate change.
most thais lack confidence in govt's handling of covid crisis and see political meddling in vaccine distribution, says nida poll.
paris: rafael nadal shrugged off his epic loss to novak djokovic at the french open insisting "life goes on" as the 13-time champion suffered just his third ever defeat in 108 matches in paris over 16 years.
in their 58th career clash, world number one djokovic triumphed 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 in the semi-final and stays on course to capture a 19th major and become the first man in over 50 years to win all four slams twice.
nadal, the defending champion and chasing a record-setting 21st grand slam title, refused to dwell on the consequences of his 4-hour 11-minute loss.
"i am sad to have lost in the most important tournament of the year for me, but life goes on, it is nothing more than a defeat on a tennis court," said 35-year-old nadal.
"if everything goes well, tomorrow i will be at home with my family and friends, and then we will see what is next.
"nadal said he plans to be back in 2022 although admitting that time is not on his side if he wants to re-establish his paris dominance.
had he made sunday's championship match, he would have been the oldest roland garros finalist in the modern era.
"although it is a very important tournament for me, i am aware that you cannot win it 15 or 16 times," he added.
"next year i will come again, god willing, with the belief and with the necessary work to be able to give myself another chance.
"in their 58th career meeting, and ninth at the french open, nadal had looked comfortably on course for victory when he raced to a 5-0 lead in the first set.
but 2016 champion djokovic, the man now responsible for two of nadal's losses in paris having also triumphed in the 2015 quarter-finals, hit back.
"did not hurt him"as the match progressed into the later heavier, humid and slower conditions, the world number one flourished.
he claimed a titanic 92-minute third set which had seen him serve for it at 5-4 and then have to save a set point in the 12th game.
in the fourth set, he was 0-2 down before racing away with the next six games for his second win in paris over nadal in nine meetings.
that sequence also included defeats in the 2012, 2014 and 2020 finals.
djokovic will now be playing in his sixth roland garros final and 29th at the slams.
"in the end, of course, if you win the third set you can say that was the key, because it changes the dynamic," said nadal.
"at times, my ball did not hurt him.
you have to give him credit, congratulate him, but i know i can play better on this court.
"when asked if he had faced the best djokovic performance of their 15-year rivalry, he was adamant.
"no, that's what i feel.
he has not faced my best self either.
"there were games on the limit, games that anyone could win, and today it was for him.
"despite that, there is a degree of evidence that nadal is beginning to lose more epics than he wins at the slams.
at the australian open in february, he lost to stefanos tsitsipas from two sets up in a five-set quarter-final defeat.
tsitsipas, who faces djokovic in sunday's final, is 13 years younger than nadal.
in the wimbledon semi-finals in 2018, nadal lost a final set 10-8 to djokovic after quitting injured in the fifth set of his australian open semi against marin cilic earlier that same year.
even gilles muller of luxembourg beat him at wimbledon in 2017, courtesy of a 15-13 final set.
"it doesn't matter," added a rueful nadal.
"that's tennis.
the player who gets used to the conditions better is the player who deserves to win.

paris: world number one novak djokovic said his win over rafa nadal in friday's epic french open semi-final was one of the top three matches he had played and he would remember it forever.
the 34-year-old serb lost the opening five games but hit back in magnificent fashion towin 3-6 6-3 7-6(4) 6-2in front of a raucous court philippe chatrier crowd.
he will now face greek stefanos tsitsipas in sunday's final, where he will seek a second french open title and a 19th grand slam title in total to move one behind the men's record haul held by nadal and roger federer.
"definitely the best match that i was part of at roland garros, and top three matches that i ever played in my entire career," djokovic told reporters after inflicting only a third ever french open defeat on 13-time champion nadal.
"considering the quality of tennis, playing my biggest rival on the court where he has had so much success and has been the dominant force in the last 15-plus years, and the atmosphere which was completely electric.
"one of these nights and matches you will remember forever.
"the omens did not look good for djokovic when he went 5-0 down in the first set despite playing well.
it had horrible similarities to last year's final which he lost to the spaniard 6-0 6-2 7-5, only this time he wrenched back control.
"the beginning of the match was kind of resembling last year's final," djokovic, who enjoyed loud support throughout the four-hour contest, said.
"i was not too nervous though even if i was 0-5 down because the feeling was different from last year's final, because i was just hitting the ball better and feeling better overall.
"i just kind of found my rhythm, found my groove.
there was no looking back.
even though i lost the first set, i found my game.
things started to work out really nicely.
"freshest guyeven for a man of djokovic's physical and mental resources, the emotions of friday's win might leave a hangover and he will be fully aware that the last time he beat nadal at the french open in 2015, he ended up losing the final to stan wawrinka.
"i'm not the freshest guy right now obviously.
but the good thing is that i have a day and a half to rejuvenate," he said.
"i'll enjoy this victory a little bit.
i think i deserve after this big win to just relax a little bit without thinking about the next opponent, even though it's a grand slam final.
"djokovic saved a set point at 5-6 in a pivotal third set full of spellbinding rallies before taking the tiebreak.
he then reeled off the last six games of the match to take his record over career-long rival nadal to 30-28. incredibly, djokovic is the first player in 116 matches to beat nadal in best-of-five sets on clay after losing the opener.
asked what it meant to beat nadal at a grand slam he has owned almost exclusively since 2005, djokovic said it was difficult to put into words.
"i mean, he has been the most dominant player of the roland garros history.
he lost two, now three times, in his entire career here," world number one djokovic said.
"the amount of wins that he has made on this court isincredible.
each time you step on the court with him, youknow that you have to kind of climb mount everest to win.
"it's just one of these matches that i really will remember for a very long time, not just because i won the match but because of the atmosphere, the occasion was very special.

paris: rafael nadal shrugged off his epic loss to novak djokovic at the french open insisting "life goes on" as the 13-time champion suffered just his third ever defeat in 108 matches in paris over 16 years.
in their 58th career clash, world number one djokovic triumphed 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 in the semi-final and stays on course to capture a 19th major and become the first man in over 50 years to win all four slams twice.
nadal, the defending champion and chasing a record-setting 21st grand slam title, refused to dwell on the consequences of his 4-hour 11-minute loss.
"i am sad to have lost in the most important tournament of the year for me, but life goes on, it is nothing more than a defeat on a tennis court," said 35-year-old nadal.
"if everything goes well, tomorrow i will be at home with my family and friends, and then we will see what is next.
"nadal said he plans to be back in 2022 although admitting that time is not on his side if he wants to re-establish his paris dominance.
had he made sunday's championship match, he would have been the oldest roland garros finalist in the modern era.
"although it is a very important tournament for me, i am aware that you cannot win it 15 or 16 times," he added.
"next year i will come again, god willing, with the belief and with the necessary work to be able to give myself another chance.
"in their 58th career meeting, and ninth at the french open, nadal had looked comfortably on course for victory when he raced to a 5-0 lead in the first set.
but 2016 champion djokovic, the man now responsible for two of nadal's losses in paris having also triumphed in the 2015 quarter-finals, hit back.
"did not hurt him"as the match progressed into the later heavier, humid and slower conditions, the world number one flourished.
he claimed a titanic 92-minute third set which had seen him serve for it at 5-4 and then have to save a set point in the 12th game.
in the fourth set, he was 0-2 down before racing away with the next six games for his second win in paris over nadal in nine meetings.
that sequence also included defeats in the 2012, 2014 and 2020 finals.
djokovic will now be playing in his sixth roland garros final and 29th at the slams.
"in the end, of course, if you win the third set you can say that was the key, because it changes the dynamic," said nadal.
"at times, my ball did not hurt him.
you have to give him credit, congratulate him, but i know i can play better on this court.
"when asked if he had faced the best djokovic performance of their 15-year rivalry, he was adamant.
"no, that's what i feel.
he has not faced my best self either.
"there were games on the limit, games that anyone could win, and today it was for him.
"despite that, there is a degree of evidence that nadal is beginning to lose more epics than he wins at the slams.
at the australian open in february, he lost to stefanos tsitsipas from two sets up in a five-set quarter-final defeat.
tsitsipas, who faces djokovic in sunday's final, is 13 years younger than nadal.
in the wimbledon semi-finals in 2018, nadal lost a final set 10-8 to djokovic after quitting injured in the fifth set of his australian open semi against marin cilic earlier that same year.
even gilles muller of luxembourg beat him at wimbledon in 2017, courtesy of a 15-13 final set.
"it doesn't matter," added a rueful nadal.
"that's tennis.
the player who gets used to the conditions better is the player who deserves to win.

paris (afp) novak djokovic handed 13-time champion rafael nadal only his third defeat in 16 years and 108 matches at the french open on friday (june 11) to reach his sixth roland garros final in an epic showdown which even beat the country's covid-19 curfew.
in their 58th career clash, djokovic triumphed 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 and stays on course to capture a 19th major and become the first man in over 50 years to win all four slams twice.
djokovic, the 2016 champion in paris who had also beaten nadal at the 2015 tournament, will face stefanos tsitsipas in sunday's final in what will be his 29th championship match at the slams.
