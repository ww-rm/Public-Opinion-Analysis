singapore, june 15 — insurance companies aviva, aia and prudential have been found by the monetary authority of singapore (mas) to have breached regulations by not reviewing the performance of their supervisors and for paying them beyond the cap set by regulations.
mas in a release today (june 15) said that the companies have been reprimanded for the offences which happened in 2017 and 2018. mas has also directed aviva financial advisers to appoint independent individuals outside the company to conduct a review of its internal control processes and to perform call-backs to all customers before any sales are completed.
the central bank also singled out peter tan shou yi, a consultant engaged by aviva, for accepting the commissions, and chee boon lai lionel, chief executive of subsidiary aviva financial advisers, for failing to perform his duties.
under the balanced scorecard framework set out in 2015 by mas, financial advisers and the supervisors who manage them are graded from a (the best) to e (the worst) based on the number and category of infractions they make in a quarter.
the value of commissions they receive, which is capped in the first year and spread out over a specified period under government requirements, are also linked to their grading.
in aviva's case, the company had engaged tan as a consultant from july 2016 to march 2020 but he also acted as a supervisor to the financial advisers representing aviva financial advisers.
despite having frequent and direct interactions with the financial advisers on sales and compliance issues, neither aviva or aviva financial advisers put in place compliance arrangements to monitor mr tan's activities from the time he joined till april 2019.  aviva financial advisers also failed to review tan's performance, assign a grade to him and pay him according to the grade, as it should given that he took on supervisory roles and responsibilities, said mas.
in addition, aviva did not cap and spread his commissions from the sales of insurance products.
tan, on his part, breached commission requirements in accepting the remuneration.
mas said aviva had contravened risk management practices on internal controls while its subsidiary had breached regulations on financial advisers.
aviva financial adviser's chief executive officer, chee, was reprimanded by mas for failing to monitor tan's activities and not properly addressing the poor conduct of his company's financial advisers, who have misrepresented the nature and features of certain insurance products to their customers.
"despite mas' repeated supervisory engagements with aviva financial advisers between august 2017 and september 2018 over the sales conduct of its representatives, the measures put in place by aviva financial advisers to address these issues remained inadequate," said mas.
as for aia, its subsidiary, aia financial advisers did not review and assess the performance of three of its managing directors who also acted as supervisors of financial advisers.
these managing directors were not graded or paid according to the balanced scorecard framework and the company did not cap and spread their commissions.
prudential made similar regulatory breaches as aia for three of its group leaders and a consultant.
in addition, prudential also breached risk management guidelines as it did not put in place enough risk management mitigation procedures and compliance arrangements to monitor the activities of the consultant and group leaders.

singapore: the monetary authority of singapore (mas) has reprimanded four financial institutions for breaching rules related to risk management practices and sales-related remuneration under the financial advisers act, the regulator said on tuesday (jun 15).
the four institutions are: aia financial advisers (aia fa), prudential assurance company singapore, aviva and aviva financial advisers (aviva fa).
mas also reprimanded two individuals – mr peter tan shou yi, a consultant engaged by aviva, and aviva fa's chief executive and director lionel chee boon chai – in relation to the matter.
mas' deputy managing director for financial supervision ho hern shin said the regulator has "dealt firmly" with these financial institutions and individuals "to send a clear message to the industry on the importance of upholding high ethical standards".
what rules were breachedin a media release, mas said that during the course of its ongoing supervision, there were indications that these financial institutions may have breached regulatory requirements on remuneration practices.
in response to queries, the regulator told cna that these indications were whistle-blowing complaints, as well as findings from its onsite inspections and offsite supervision.
it then conducted an investigation and found "numerous instances" where remuneration was paid to supervisors – a person responsible, both directly or indirectly, for the supervision or management of a financial adviser – in contravention of requirements under the financial advisers act.
one is the balanced scorecard requirements (bsc) for the sale of investment products.
under this, the variable income of supervisors and representatives are determined by the fulfilment of non-sales key performance indicators, such as understanding a client's needs and suitability of product recommendations.
grades are given to the supervisors and representatives every quarter.
another is the spreading and capping of commissions (scc) requirements that apply to the sale of regular premium life policies.
insurers and financial adviser firms are required to cap the variable income payable to representatives and supervisors to 55 per cent in the first year, and spread the remaining variable income payable over a "prescribed period".
both requirements were introduced as part of the financial advisory industry review in 2015. the financial institutions and individuals had also breached the financial advisers regulations and guidelines on risk management practices, which require financial institutions to put in place appropriate policies to ensure compliance with regulations.
these various breaches took place between 2016 and 2019. what happened at avivamas said aviva engaged mr peter tan shou yi as a consultant from july 2016 to march 2020 to provide strategic advice on aviva fa's business.
but mr tan "went beyond providing strategic advice and acted as a supervisor" to representatives at aviva fa during this period by having frequent and direct interactions with these representatives, including discussions on sales and compliance issues.
from july 2016 to april 2019, neither aviva nor aviva fa put in place compliance arrangements to monitor mr tan's activities in aviva fa.
mas said for failing to put in place these arrangements, aviva and aviva fa had contravened the guidelines on risk management practices – internal controls and the financial advisers regulations, respectively.
"mr tan had acted as a supervisor of aviva fa by virtue of his roles and responsibilities in the firm, but aviva fa failed to review and assess mr tan's performance, assign a bsc grade to him, and determine and pay his remuneration in accordance with the bsc," the regulator said.
"aviva also failed to cap and spread his variable income in accordance with the scc.
in accepting such remuneration, mr tan also breached the scc.
"aviva fa's chief executive and director, mr chee, was also reprimanded for failing to "discharge the duties of his office", said mas.
apart from failing to ensure that proper arrangements were in place to monitor mr tan's activities, he did not properly address the issue of the poor conduct of aviva fa's representatives which included misrepresentations to customers regarding the nature and features of certain insurance products.
mas said despite its repeated supervisory engagements with aviva fa between august 2017 and september 2018 over the sales conduct of its representatives, the measures put in place "remained inadequate".
it therefore directed aviva fa to appoint independent external persons to conduct a "holistic review" of the company's internal control processes, and to perform call-backs to all customers before any sales are completed.
these measures remain in place.
it also required aviva fa to investigate, take disciplinary actions against the representatives concerned and provide remediation for the affected customers, according to further information provided by an mas spokesperson.
aviva fa has done so, the spokesperson added, noting that the regulator will take "appropriate regulatory actions" if breaches of mas' regulations are established.
what happened at aia faaia fa did not review and assess the performance of three of its managing directors who had acted as supervisors, said mas.
it also failed to assign bsc grades and pay remunerations in accordance with the bsc, as well as cap and spread the variable income of these managing directors according to the scc.
what happened at prudentialin prudential's case, the company had appointed three individuals referred to as "master group agency manager" leaders and a consultant to act as supervisors.
but it failed to review and assess the performance of these leaders and consultant, assign bsc grades to them, as well as determine and pay their remuneration in accordance with the requirements.
prudential also failed to put in place adequate risk mitigation procedures and compliance arrangements to monitor the activities of this group of leaders and consultant.
no direct harm to customers: masa reprimand is a formal regulatory action under the financial advisers act and registers "serious concerns" from the mas regarding a misconduct.
those issued with reprimands are required to remediate the issues "promptly".
asked why the mas chose to issue reprimands in this case, the spokesperson said: "in deciding on the appropriate enforcement action for a case, mas considers all the relevant circumstances, including the seriousness of the misconduct, the impact of the misconduct on customers or the financial sector, and any remediation actions taken.
"the financial regulator said that there was no evidence of "direct harm to customers" as a result of the breaches by the four financial institutions.
"nevertheless, the failures are viewed seriously because the bsc and scc requirements are intended to align the interests of financial advisory firms, supervisors and representatives with those of their customers, and promote a culture of fair dealing," the emailed response said.
"non-compliance with the requirements therefore increases the risk that customers' interests could be prejudiced.
"in response to cna's queries, aviva singapore said the lapses identified by mas occurred prior to its merger with a consortium led by singapore life, which was completed in november last year.
"following the transaction, the newly constituted board has invested significant time and resources to address the underlying issues.
we have strengthened our controls to prevent the recurrence of such issues, and these are being validated by an independent external auditor," the spokesperson said.
leadership changes were also done "to strengthen management effectiveness and accelerate culture change", the emailed response said.
prudential singapore said it would "work closely" with mas to further enhance its controls in relation to the bsc requirements and accompanying risk management measures with the view of resolving the issues raised.
aia fa told cna that it had cooperated fully with mas during the course of investigations and would continue to work closely with the regulator for the remediation actions required.
it added that it was fully committed to protecting the interests of its customers and that no customers were affected by this matter.

singapore four financial institutions were reprimanded by the monetary authority of singapore (mas) for breaching rules over commission payments.
aia financial advisers (aia fa), prudential assurance company singapore (prudential), and aviva, along with its wholly owned subsidiary aviva financial advisers (aviva fa), were found to have breached risk management and supervisor remuneration regulations, the central bank said on tuesday (june 15).
mas also reprimanded mr peter tan shou yi, a consultant engaged by aviva, for accepting remuneration in breach of regulatory requirements, and aviva fa's chief executive and director, mr lionel chee boon chai, for his failure to discharge the duties of his office.
mr tan and his company, peter tan organisation management and consultancy, were sued in 2019 by prudential for up to $2.
5 billion for allegedly "surreptitiously" orchestrating a mass defection to aviva's subsidiary, aviva financial advisers, in mid-2016.
in may 2021, the high court found he had breached his agency agreement in soliciting the defection.
an mas spokesman said a reprimand registers the authority's serious concerns regarding the misconduct by a financial institution (fi).
"the fis and individuals are required to remediate the issues promptly.
mas may also take the reprimands into account when considering action to be taken against the fis/individuals for any future contraventions," the spokesman said.
in deciding on the appropriate enforcement action, mas will consider all the circumstances of the case, including the seriousness of the misconduct, the impact of the misconduct on customers or the financial sector, and any remediation action taken.
mas said that following indications of rule violations by the insurers, it conducted an investigation and found numerous instances where remuneration was paid to supervisors in contravention of requirements under the financial advisers act (faa).
indications of violations may emerge from a whistle-blower, a complaint by a customer or during the course of regular on-site checks conducted by regulators.
these violations were related to the balanced scorecard requirements (bsc) for the sale of investment products, and the spreading and capping of commissions rules (scc) for the sale of regular premium life policies.
the bsc and scc seek to align the incentives of financial adviser (fa) firms, agents and supervisors with their customers' interests, to promote a culture of fair dealing.
under the bsc, supervisors' and agents' variable incomes are determined with reference to the fulfilment of non-sales key performance indicators (kpis), such as whether an agent has taken steps to understand the customer's needs, recommend suitable products and make adequate disclosures.
the aim is to raise the quality of advice and to mitigate risks of product pushing and pressure sales tactics.
under the scc, which applies to the sale of regular premium life policies to individuals, insurers and fa firms are required to cap the variable income payable to agents and supervisors in the first year and spread the remaining variable income payable over a prescribed period.
the rule addresses concerns that an agent who has received most of his total variable income upfront may not be incentivised to provide quality after-sales services to his clients.
narrating its investigation and its findings, mas said three of aia fa's managing directors (mds) had acted as supervisors of aia fa.
they were responsible for the supervision of the conduct and performance of the agents in their respective agency groups, including sales and compliance standards.
however, aia fa failed to review and assess the performance of these mds, assign bsc grades as well as determine and pay their remuneration in accordance with the bsc.
aia fa also failed to cap and spread the mds' variable income in accordance with the scc.
mas also reprimanded mr peter tan shou yi (left), a consultant engaged by aviva, and aviva fa's chief executive and director, mr lionel chee boon chai.

the mas investigation found that mr tan, engaged by aviva as a consultant from july 2016 to march 2020, went beyond providing strategic advice and acted as a supervisor to aviva fa's agents.
while mr tan from july 2016 to april 2019 had frequent and direct interactions with aviva fa's agents, including discussions on sales and compliance issues, neither aviva nor aviva fa had put in place compliance arrangements to monitor his activities in aviva fa.
hence, aviva contravened the guidelines on risk management practices internal controls (rm guidelines) and aviva fa contravened the financial advisers regulations.
at prudential, three individuals referred to as master group agency manager (mgam) leaders and a consultant appointed by the firm had acted as supervisors.
however, prudential failed to review and assess the performance of the mgam leaders and the consultant, assign bsc grades to them, as well as determine and pay their remuneration in accordance with the bsc.
prudential also breached the rm guidelines as it failed to put in place adequate risk mitigation procedures and compliance arrangements to monitor the activities of the mgam leaders and consultant.
ms ho hern shin, mas' deputy managing director for financial supervision, said: "mas expects financial institutions to have robust arrangements to ensure that their agents place their customers' interests first.
"she noted that mas' requirements on remuneration practices relating to the sale of investment and life insurance products aim to promote good sales conduct in the financial advisory industry.
"we have dealt firmly with these financial institutions and individuals who have breached our regulations, to send a clear message to the industry on the importance of upholding high ethical standards," she said.
according to mas, all financial institutions are expected to put in place appropriate compliance arrangements to ensure that they comply with all applicable laws and rules and to mitigate the risks of non-compliance.
the rm guidelines provide guidance to financial institutions on sound and prudent internal control practices.
fa firms are also required under regulation 14 of the financial advisers regulations to put in place compliance arrangements to ensure they comply with the applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
effective compliance arrangements help protect customers' interests and reduce the possibility of unexpected losses or damage.
the mas spokesman said: "in respect of the impact to customers, mas has not found evidence of direct harm to customers as a result of the fis' failure to adhere to the bsc and scc requirements.
"nevertheless, the failures are viewed seriously because the bsc and scc requirements are intended to align the interests of financial advisory firms, supervisors and representatives with those of their customers, and promote a culture of fair dealing.
non-compliance with the requirements therefore increases the risk that customers' interests could be prejudiced.
"the spokesman pointed out that the poor conduct of the aviva fa agents included misrepresentations to customers regarding the features and benefits of certain life insurance products.
mas has required aviva to conduct investigations, take disciplinary action against the agents concerned, and provide remediation for the affected customers, which the firm has done.
"where breaches of mas' regulations are established, mas will take appropriate regulatory action," the spokesman said.
an aviva singapore spokesman said the lapses identified by mas occurred before the sale of aviva singapore to a consortium led by singapore life, which was completed in november 2020. 
 
since then, aviva said, it has made leadership changes to strengthen management effectiveness and accelerate culture change.
"following the transaction, the newly constituted board has invested significant time and resources to address the underlying issues.
we have strengthened our controls to prevent the recurrence of such issues, and these are being validated by an independent external auditor," the spokesman said.
"we will ensure we hold ourselves to high standards on regulatory compliance. "
prudential singapore said in a statement: "we will work closely with mas to further enhance our controls in relation to the balanced scorecard framework and accompanying risk management measures, in view of resolving the issues raised so we can continue to provide the highest standard of service to our customers.
