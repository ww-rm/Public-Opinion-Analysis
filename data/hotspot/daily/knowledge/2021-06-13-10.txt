the men, aged 46 and 48, are accused of collecting money from victims of the scam and are believed to have received commission for their involvement, said the singapore police force (spf) on thursday.
the police said they received reports from five victims between jul 18 and 29 last year.
"phone scammers claiming to be from the 'chinese police' had accused the victims of being involved in transnational money-laundering crimes," said spf.
"the victims were believed to have been subsequently misled into handing cash totalling s$1,580,000 to various persons in singapore to prove that their money was not derived from illegal activities.
"police investigations revealed that the two men became involved in the scam after responding to a job listing on facebook which promised s$300 for courier work.
"after being added to a whatsapp chat group and following the instructions by the group's organisers, the duo allegedly began collecting money amounting to s$230,000 from three out of the five victims," spf said.
"the collections were then purportedly handed over to unknown persons.
"both men allegedly received a total of s$15,700 as commission but they have since surrendered the amount during investigations, said the police.
they will be charged for assisting another to retain benefits from criminal conduct under the corruption, drug trafficking and other serious offences (confiscation of benefits) act.
if convicted, they face up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to s$500,000, or both.
the police advised members of the public to ignore unsolicited calls asking for money to be handed over in relation to supposed criminal investigations.
they also warned against giving out personal information and bank details.
"no local government agency will demand payment through a phone call or other social messaging platforms, demand that you hand over cash to strangers or ask you for your personal banking information such as your internet banking passwords," spf said.
"for foreign residents receiving calls from persons claiming to be police officers or government officials from your home country, please call your embassy/high commission to verify the claims of the caller.

singapore two men will be charged in court on friday (june 11) for their alleged roles in a series of scams that cheated their victims of almost $1.
6 million.
the scams involved people calling and posing as police officers from china, said the singapore police force on thursday.
between july 18 and july 29, 2020, the commercial affairs department received reports from five victims who had fallen prey to scammers pretending to be chinese officials.
phone scammers claiming to be the chinese police had accused the victims of being involved in transnational money-laundering crimes.
the victims were believed to have been subsequently misled into handing over cash totalling $1,580,000 to various people in singapore to prove that their money was not derived from illegal activities.
the men, aged 46 and 48, are alleged to have been involved in the ruse as couriers, and received a combined $15,700 as commission.
they are suspected of collecting $230,000 from three victims, which they handed over to unidentified people.
the men got involved after responding to a job listing on facebook promising $300 for courier work.
they were then added into a whatsapp chat where they received instructions to collect money from the victims.
they surrendered their commission money over to the police during investigations.
the pair were caught after the police received reports from the victims.
the duo will be charged with assisting another to retain benefits from criminal conduct, which carries a penalty of 10 years in jail and/or a fine of up to $500,000.
the police advise members of the public to take the following precautions when they receive unsolicited calls asking them to part with their money:1.  ignore the calls and the caller's instructions.
2.  understand that no local government agency will demand payment through a phone call or social messaging platforms, or demand that they hand over cash to strangers, or ask for personal banking information.
3.  if they are not singaporean, check with their embassy or high commission to verify the call.
4.  call a friend or relative before making any decisions.
"do not be pressured by the caller to act impulsively," added the police.
the police also said that the public should not collect money for strangers, especially if they are claiming to be law enforcement officers.
"such callers are likely to be scammers, and the members of the public who act on their instructions may unwittingly have committed a crime by assisting to launder money from criminal activities," they added.
if they have information related to these scams, or if they have any doubts, the public can call 1800-255-0000 or submit it online at www.

singapore: a man was jailed two weeks on friday (jun 11) for assaulting his wife after she rejected his request for a sexual favour.
calvin kok chong meng, 32, pleaded guilty to one charge of committing family violence against his wife when she had a personal protection order against him.
a second charge of voluntarily causing hurt to his wife was taken into consideration.
the court heard that the victim had obtained a personal protection order against kok on jan 18, 2017 after he hit her.
on mar 17, 2021, kok had a couple of alcoholic drinks after returning home from work at around 11.
30pm.
at about midnight, he went into the room where his wife was sleeping and asked her for a sexual favour.
when his wife rejected him, he got upset and began hitting her, according to court documents.
the victim was underneath the blanket on the bed when kok began slapping her several times on her thighs and arms.
that same day, the victim sought medical attention for her multiple bruises, which included bruising over her head, face, neck, arms and thighs.
she also lodged a police report.
the prosecutor asked for two weeks' jail, noting that kok's wife has since forgiven him and they are going for matrimonial counselling.
kok, who did not have a lawyer, requested for a lighter sentence with no jail, saying he would lose his job if he was imprisoned.
he said he needed the job to support his family, including his daughter and grandmother.
he asked for a chance to turn over a new leaf and said his wife was in court to mitigate for him if need be.
the judge responded: "yes, but she was not willing to be intimate and you were violent towards her.
"she added that the high court has indicated that jail terms must be imposed for cases like kok's.
kok replied that he understood and promised not to reoffend in the future.
for breaching a protection order, he could have been jailed up to six months, fined up to s$2,000, or both.
