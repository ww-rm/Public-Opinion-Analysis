More S'poreans have no religious affiliation: Population census, Singapore News & Top Stories.
singapore: more households are using english as the language most frequently spoken at home, according to singapore's latest census of population released by the department of statistics (dos) on wednesday (jun 16).
among residents aged five and above in 2020, 48.
3 per cent spoke english most frequently at home, up from 32.
3 per cent in 2010. of those who spoke english most frequently at home, about 87 per cent also spoke a vernacular language in the same setting, the census noted.
the census of population, conducted once every 10 years, is the largest national survey undertaken in singapore to collect statistics such as demographic, social and economic data.
a total of 150,000 households were surveyed last year.
english more common across major ethnic groupsthe trend on the use of english at home was observed across all major ethnic groups.
correspondingly, the use of mandarin, chinese dialects, malay and tamil lost ground.
for the chinese ethnic group, english overtook mandarin as the most used language at home – with a proportion of 47.
6 per cent in 2020, up from 32.
6 per cent in 2010. the use of mandarin as the predominant language fell to 40.
2 per cent in 2020, down from 47.
7 per cent a decade before.
the same goes for chinese dialects, which only accounted for 11.
8 per cent of responses, down from 19.
2 per cent in 2010. for the malay ethnic group, a majority still spoke the malay language most frequently at home in 2020.  but at 60.
7 per cent, this was lower than the 82.
7 per cent recorded in 2010, said the dos.
the proportion who used english most frequently rose to 39 per cent in 2020, more than double the 17 per cent from a decade before.
among this group, malay is still the second most frequently spoken language for more than nine in 10 respondents.
for the indian ethnic group, those who spoke english most frequently continued to form the majority at 59.
2 per cent, up from 41.
6 per cent in 2010. after english, tamil or other indian languages were the second most frequently spoken language.
taking age into accountthe use of english at home was generally more common among the younger population than those who are older, the department of statistics said.
for chinese residents, for instance, nearly eight in 10 of those aged between five and 14 used english the most at home in 2020.  this is compared to about three in 10 elderly residents – aged 55 and over – who did the same.
this disparity was also seen among the malays about six in 10 of young residents spoke english the most, compared to fewer than two in 10 for the elderly.
the gap was narrower for the indian ethnic group.
about seven in 10 of the young residents used english the most at home, while half of elderly residents did so.
overall, between 2010 and 2020, the use of english grew across all age groups for all ethnic groups.
throwing education into the mixthis proportion also rose across all education groups, the dos said.
"in general, residents with higher qualifications were more likely to use english the most frequently at home," it added.
for example, among singapore residents aged 15 and above with university degrees, english was the most-used language at home for about six in 10 of the chinese, malays and indians in 2020. but among those with below secondary qualifications, this figure fell to about one in 10 for the chinese and malays, and about three in 10 for indians, said the dos.
more information from the census will be released on friday.

"it tells us where we were, where we're at now, and identifies some of the things that we need to address going forward," said indranee rajah, minister in the prime minister's office, who oversees the national population and talent division.
though some of the data will be affected as the survey was done amid the covid-19 pandemic, she said the census captures "broad trends over the decade .
.
.
notwithstanding the blips over the last one and a half years".
the total population increased from 5.

8 per cent, while that of men increased from 37.
1 per cent to 41.

for instance, in 2020, among residents aged 40 to 49, about 17.
4 per cent and 18.
6 per cent of chinese men and women were single.
this was higher than 15 per cent and 9.
2 per cent for malay men and women respectively, and 6.

3 per cent for indian men and women.
fewer children bornat the same time, women generally had fewer children in 2020 compared to a decade before, said the dos.
among female residents aged 15 and above who have ever been married, the average number of children born fell across all age brackets.
the average decreased from 2.
24 children per woman in 2010, to 2.
04 in 2020. lower averages were also seen across all educational groups, said the dos, adding that the largest decrease was observed among women with below secondary qualifications.
in 2010, women in this group aged 40 to 49 had an average of 2.
21 children, but in 2020, this figure fell to 2.
01. still, in line with previous trends, higher educated females had fewer children on average than those with lower educational qualifications.
among these female residents aged 40 to 49, university graduates had an average of 1.
66 children in 2020 – lower than the average of 1.
94 children among those with secondary qualifications, the dos said.
education levels improvethe educational profile of the resident population improved between 2010 and 2020. in 2020, among residents aged 25 and above, nearly six in ten had post-secondary or higher qualifications.
this is up from less than five in 10 in 2010.
"the chinese, malay and indian communities all saw improvements in their educational attainment," added the dos.
it also noted that women have "made more significant progress" in this aspect.
for instance, among residents aged 55 and over in 2020, the proportion of men with post-secondary or higher qualifications was 11.
2 percentage points higher than that of women.
this narrowed to a 2.
4 percentage-point difference among those aged 35 to 44. among those aged 25 to 34, the proportion for women – at 90.
2 per cent marginally beat the figure for men, which was 90 per cent.

9 per cent in 2010. across all age groups, multi-language literacy rates were also higher or remained stable.
there was an overall increase in english literacy across the three major ethnic groups, the dos noted.
relevance of sorting data by ethnic groupsat a press conference on the release of the data, ms indranee was asked by reporters about the continued relevance of separating data by ethnic categories, given that there may be sharp inequalities even within these groups.
ms indranee said being a multi-racial and multi-religious state is "a constant work in progress".
"(this) also means that you don't really ever get to a post-race situation where it doesn't matter at all.
"she added: "if you didn't have this data then let's say that a particular ethnic group was not doing well compared to the others.
you will have no idea how many, you will have no idea in what areas, you wouldn't know whether the problem was education, or whether the problem was something else.
"all you would have is just one big blob of data, and you will have no ability to say, actually this group is not doing so well.
what are the reasons, how can we help, what are the interventions that we can make?
""the thinking behind this data is: to the extent that any group may not be doing as well as any others in any areas, then it tells us that as a society in terms of policy, then we should do something to try and make sure that we can bridge any gap.

this is up from less than five in 10 in 2010.
"the chinese, malay and indian communities all saw improvements in their educational attainment," added the dos.
it also noted that women have "made more significant progress" in this aspect.
for instance, among residents aged 55 and over in 2020, the proportion of men with post-secondary or higher qualifications was 11.

there was an overall increase in english literacy across the three major ethnic groups, the dos noted.
relevance of sorting data by ethnic groupsat a press conference on the release of the data, ms indranee was asked by reporters about the continued relevance of separating data by ethnic categories, given that there may be sharp inequalities even within these groups.
ms indranee said being a multi-racial and multi-religious state is "a constant work in progress".
"(this) also means that you don't really ever get to a post-race situation where it doesn't matter at all.
"she added: "if you didn't have this data then let's say that a particular ethnic group was not doing well compared to the others.
you will have no idea how many, you will have no idea in what areas, you wouldn't know whether the problem was education, or whether the problem was something else.
"all you would have is just one big blob of data, and you will have no ability to say, actually this group is not doing so well.
what are the reasons, how can we help, what are the interventions that we can make?
""the thinking behind this data is: to the extent that any group may not be doing as well as any others in any areas, then it tells us that as a society in terms of policy, then we should do something to try and make sure that we can bridge any gap.
