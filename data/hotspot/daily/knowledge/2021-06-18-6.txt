kuala lumpur prime minister muhyiddin yassin's plan to convene parliament as late as october was dented on wednesday (june 16) after malaysia's king called for the federal legislative to meet "as soon as possible" to debate emergency laws and the nation's exit strategy from its worst covid-19 outbreak.
this was swiftly followed by a joint statement from the malay rulers nine state monarchs who rotate five-year terms as the federation's king expressing the view that the emergency, which suspends the need for legislatures to reconvene every six months, need not be extended beyond its aug 1 expiry date.
the statements were issued after a special meeting between sultan abdullah ahmad shah and eight other heads of state on thursday afternoon, a culmination of a week-long series of audiences the king gave to 18 party chiefs and experts over the pandemic and the emergency.
"his majesty expressed the opinion that a parliament sitting must be held as soon as possible.
.
.
parliament is an important platform for elected representatives to discuss various issues relating to the covid-19 pandemic," the palace said.
his fellow sovereigns concurred, adding that they were of "one mind" that "there is no need to place the nation under emergency rule after aug 1".
however, it is the king who has to assent or reject the government's advice on an emergency, and sultan abdullah was silent on the matter of an extension in his statement.
it is not known if tan sri muhyiddin himself raised the issue in his audience with the king on tuesday or in previous meetings.
nonetheless, a source close to one of the royal households noted "the reason it's made that way is the issue (of an emergency) is not within the jurisdiction of the council of rulers, but the king", hence the opinion is not expressed by sultan abdullah so that his discretion may be reserved.
both the king and the other rulers also issued separate statements last october, when the government's initial request for an emergency was rejected.
while sultan abdullah said such a decree was not necessary then, he called on politicians to ensure the passage of budget 2021 to ensure the nation's fight against covid-19 would not be undermined.
the other rulers, however, stressed on "justice and limiting any element of abuse of power".
parliament last sat in december to narrowly approve this year's budget and mr muhyiddin's tenuous grip on a legislative majority has not been tested since, raising questions over his legitimacy.
the emergency, which came into effect on jan 11, was imposed as malaysia struggled to contain the coronavirus outbreak after a spike in september.
but critics say it has only entrenched the muhyiddin administration, whose parliamentary majority remains in doubt after a series of defections in both directions, as measures to tackle the disease did not require an emergency.
the fact that may saw the most covid-19 deaths in a month has further fuelled the view that the emergency has not helped the fight against the pandemic.
mr muhyiddin had on tuesday unveiled his national recovery plan, which outlines criteria in terms of daily infections, healthcare capacity and vaccination rates for the government to progressively loosen an ongoing lockdown.
"i pledge my commitment that the parliamentary session can convene.
.
.
around the months of september or october, subject to stringent sops (standard operating procedures)," he had said.
"my stance from the very beginning has always been that the democratic parliamentary system should be able to function once again after the covid-19 cases are well under control and when we are close to achieving herd immunity.
"but both the king and his fellow rulers indicated the importance of "a government that is stable and enjoys public confidence and support of the majority".
the royal statements have spurred opponents like umno president ahmad zahid hamidi, whose party wants to withdraw from government and force polls it believes will result in its return to dominance.
"umno supports and views seriously his majesty's call for the need to establish a stable and strong government that is capable of functioning effectively in addressing covid-19 and reviving the economy," he said in an immediate response.
opposition leader anwar ibrahim said: "i await the next step from the government led by muhyiddin yassin to call parliament as soon as possible.

                    thursday, 17 jun 2021
                is the article 150 power to declare or revoke an emergency or to set up a national operations council as in 1969 a discretionary or a non-discretionary function?our constitution has invested the yang di-pertuan agong with vast powers and functions in the executive, legislative and judicial fields and in relation to islam.
a computer check indicates that the words "yang di-pertuan agong" occur in the federal constitution 274 times!if all of these 274 mentions indicate the existence of discretionary powers, then his majesty is obviously an absolute and not a constitutional monarch.
it is submitted that the proper approach to constitutional interpretation is that no provision conferring power and function on the king should be interpreted literally or in isolation but must be read in the light of articles 40(1) and 40(1a), which require his majesty to act on advice.
articles 40 and 40(1a) must be grafted onto every article where the words "yang di-pertuan agong" occur unless the provision explicitly confers discretion.
the powers and functions of our king are divisible into two broad categories:> non-discretionary functions, which are exercised on advice and constitute the bulk of his functions.
concerning these, the monarch may advise, caution, warn and delay but must, in the last resort, accept the advice rendered; and> discretionary powers, which are exercised in his own judgment.
the king may consult anyone including his brother rulers, the prime minister, attorney general, respected public or private figures, or any experts he may choose to summon to the palace.
but ultimately, the mantle of responsibility falls on his great shoulders.
discretionary functions are mentioned in article 40(2) and cover the following critical matters of state: appointment of a prime minister; withholding of consent to a request for dissolution of parliament; convening of the conference of rulers; and "any other case mentioned in this constitution".
it is submitted that the words "any other case mentioned in this constitution" must mean "any other case (explicitly) mentioned", for example concerning the appointment of the public service commission under article 139(4); appointment of the education service commission under article 141a(2); appointment of other commission members under article 143(1)(a); and appointment of state governors under the 8th schedule, item 19a.
in several situations, the king's personal discretion is necessarily implied.
these situations are the right under article 40(1) to ask for any information from the government; delaying legislation by 30 days under article 66(4a); appointment of a caretaker prime minister after parliament is dissolved under article 43(2); and appointment of an interim, minority, provisional or unity government if there is a deeply fractured or "hung parliament" with no faction commanding an absolute majority.
in the past few weeks, the question on many lips is whether the article 150 power to declare or revoke an emergency or to set up a national operations council as in 1969 is a discretionary or non-discretionary function.
it is submitted that the king's emergency powers are exercisable on advice.
despite the subjective language of clause (1) of article 150 ("if the yang di-pertuan agong is satisfied"), it is noticeable that nowhere in article 150 is there any explicit mention of personal discretion.
in several court cases, like stephen kalong ningkan v tun abang haji openg and tawi sli (no 2) (1967), m madhavan nair (1975), and teh cheng poh (1979), it has been ruled that emergency powers are subject to article 40(1).
in teh cheng poh, there is this telling statement from the privy council that when one finds in the constitution or federal law powers conferred upon the yang di-pertuan agong that are expressed to be exercisable if he is of opinion or is satisfied, the reference to his opinion or satisfaction is, in reality, a reference to the collective opinion or satisfaction of members of the cabinet.
despite the above judicial decisions, there are contrasting views that article 150 powers are independent of the prime minister's advice.
these views are anchored on several facts.
first, in 1983, then prime minister datuk seri dr mahathir mohamad pushed through parliament the constitution (amendment) act 1983, which amended article 150 to read: "if the prime minister is satisfied that a grave emergency exists he shall advise the yang di-pertuan agong accordingly and the yang di-pertuan agong shall then issue a proclamation".
this amendment elicited strong opposition from the conference of rulers and was repealed in early 1984. the story behind the repeal lends credence to the view that emergency powers under article 150 are not subject to the prime minister's advice and are personal to the monarch.
second, in october 2020, the present yang di-pertuan agong is known to have refused the prime minister's advice to proclaim an emergency.
the refusal was not challenged in a court of law by the prime minister and sets a political precedent of the throne supplying a check and balance against the political executive's use of emergency powers.
third, the emergency ordinance of jan 14, this year, in section 2 establishes an "independent special committee" appointed by the king "to advise the yang di-pertuan agong on the continuing existence of the grave emergency".
why have this independent committee if the king is bound by cabinet advice?fourth, in the case of pp v mohd amin mohd razali (2000), the learned judge, zulkefli j. , suggested that in relation to article 150's emergency powers, though the king is bound by the advice of the prime minister, the prime minister whose advice is binding on the king must be one with democratic legitimacy in parliament.
on may 15, 1969, there was no parliament and the prime minister was a caretaker prime minister without parliamentary backing.
the judge ruled that in some circumstances, like during the dissolution of parliament when the prime minister is a mere caretaker, the king is not bound by the advice of the prime minister and can act independently.
perhaps the mohd amin mohd razali precedent will also apply if the prime minister is an interim prime minister (like dr mahathir was in february 2020).
what about our circumstances today?there is a duly appointed prime minister and cabinet in place.
an emergency is in operation.
under section 11 of the ordinance of jan 14, the prime minister and cabinet have the security of tenure as long as the emergency lasts, i. e.  till aug 1. parliament is in suspension under section 14 of the ordinance.
but on aug 1, the laws about parliament to reconvene will kick in.
the guarantee of security of tenure for the prime minister will expire.
it is a matter of conjecture whether the prime minister will seek an extension of the emergency.
what if the prime minister faces a vote of no-confidence in the reconvened house (or if the house is not in session), a challenge to his authority under the datuk seri nizar jamaluddin precedent of 2009 in perak?is the king entitled under the constitution's spirit of parliamentary democracy to advise the prime minister to settle the issue of confidence first before seeking an extension to the existing emergency proclamation or the issuance of a new one?what if, after aug 1, the prime minister loses a vote of no-confidence in the house and nobody else can secure a stable majority in the "hung parliament"?will this be a ground for the king to act independently to proclaim a new emergency due to the collapse of civil government and to set up a national operations council?these are untested and untried issues.
what adds further complexity is that under article 150(8), the satisfaction of the yang di-pertuan agong cannot be challenged in a court of law.

kuala lumpur (the star/asia news network) it was 7pm on wednesday (june 16) when the malay rulers concluded their meeting with the yang di-pertuan agong (malaysian king) at istana negara.
the special meeting of the rulers started at 2.
30pm and most of them spoke openly and candidly.
this was not a scheduled conference of rulers meeting, which would have included the respective yang di-pertuan negeri (heads of states), in the presence of the menteris besar and chief ministers.
this time, it was just the malay rulers and no one else.
on their minds were four main issues the emergency which ends aug 1, the covid-19 pandemic, vaccination exercise and parliament.
it was clear they wanted the parliament to convene as soon as possible although no date was mentioned.
in the statement issued after the meeting by keeper of the rulers' seal, tan sri syed danial syed ahmad, the malay rulers declared that there was no need to place the country under the emergency beyond aug 1. the rulers concurred with the view of the king that parliament should be reconvened as soon as possible.
"the rulers are also of the view that state legislative assemblies can reconvene soon," the statement added.
but they clearly understood their roles in a constitutional monarchy, rulers cannot encroach into politics.
meaning, rulers cannot force parliament to meet, and neither could they fix a date.
this has to come from the prime minister.
still, it would not be wrong to say that some of the rulers have not been happy with political developments in the country.
the key words in their statement, which some media missed or felt it was not important, were this "the rulers concur that lives and livelihood must be given priority above other matters.
"by that, it meant the endless politicking by politicians, as well.
one or two have privately expressed their disdain at the level of political manoeuvring, attempts at power grab and push for an immediate general election.
mr syed danial said the rulers agreed that the political temperature in the country needed to be brought down, and that it was important to have a stable government which has the support and confidence of the majority of the people.
"the rulers concur that lives and livelihoods must be given priority above other matters and for the vaccination drive to be ramped up by minimising bureaucracy, so that 80 per cent of the population can be inoculated to achieve the targeted herd immunity quickly," he said.
he added that the rulers also wanted measures to tackle the covid-19 pandemic to be inclusive and involve various stakeholders.
while the rulers merely said that parliament should meet "as soon as possible", they are also well aware of the provisions, in that the speaker must give a minimum 28 days notice.
this means, for example, if the dewan rakyat (parliament) were to convene on aug 28, the notice must go out by aug 1. upon receiving the notice from the pm, the secretary of the house would then proceed.
the members of parliament must be given 10 working days to submit questions and at least 14 days for any motions.
there will also be a need to facilitate travelling plans of mps to gather including flights, as the country is still imposing a ban on inter-state and inter-district travels.
since it is possible that this meet of mps would be a new session, the pm would then has to seek the advice of the king on his availability as he would need to address parliament, as is done every start of the annual parliamentary meeting.
august is also the national day month.
but there is also a provision which stipulates that the pm can call for a special meeting of the parliament by merely writing to the speaker to inform him of the need.
in this case, it is for a specific reason, and the pm will decide on the agenda.
it would most likely be a short meeting and almost certainly, would be criticised by mps.
so, when (prime minister) tan sri muhyiddin yassin suggested that parliament can only convene in september or october, he was not far off the mark, but he has come under fire because he did not explain the rationale behind it.
given the stand made by the rulers, the pm can perhaps expedite the date and at the same time, meet the requirements of the parliament rules.
finally, mr muhyiddin could have explained better why he suggested that the meeting should be in september or october.
not many malaysians including reporters who do not cover the parliament beat would understand the requirements.
in short the pm cannot decide by saying, let's meet next week.
it isn't a meeting at the kopi tiam or the spa.
but as the rulers rightly pointed out, the political temperature needs to be brought down and a stable government that has the support of the people.
the rulers were very clear at the meeting: parliament is the base of the people and for a democracy to function properly, the mps must go back to the august house.
the challenge now is to see how many of these mps would be able to participate intelligently in the debates without the theatrics.
we do not need any more shouting matches, walk-outs and name calling.
that is what the rakyat (people) hates most.

kuala lumpur: the malaysian government has acknowledged the king's views and will take follow-up measures based on the constitution and the laws, said the prime minister's office on thursday (jun 17).
the king al-sultan abdullah ri'ayatuddin mustafa billah shah has said thatthe parliament should reconvene as soon as possible, after chairing a special rulers' conference on wednesday.
in a statement, the prime minister's office said prime minister muhyiddin yassin had previously informed the king during prior audiences on the progress of various efforts, from the pandemic's management to the national immunisation programme and economic aid, as well as the recently-unveiled national recovery plan.
"in upholding the king's decrees, the government will take follow-up measures based on the federal constitution and the state laws," the statement read.
the special rulers' conference came after the king granted audiences to 18 key political leaders, who presented their views on the pandemic management and the country's current situation.
the king said parliament meetings should be held to enable the emergency ordinances and the national recovery plan to be debated by parliamentarians.
the malay rulers added that there wasno need to further extend malaysia's state of emergencybeyond aug 1. on wednesday night, de facto law minister takiyuddin hassan said that although the king had called for parliament to reconvene as soon as possible, no specific date had been specified.
"the prime minister has already stated september or october," mr takiyuddin, who is also parti islam se-malaysia (pas) secretary-general, said during an online interview on the bicara harakah talk show.
the minister in the prime minister's department added that a parliament sitting would definitely be convened "in three months' time".
on tuesday, mr muhyiddin said in a televised address that the parliament meeting could be held during the third phase of the national recovery plan, which is likely to happen inseptember or octoberthis year.
in his response to the rulers' statement, the deputy president of the united malays national organisation (umno), mohammad hassan said that it was necessary for the government to convene parliament sessions as soon as possible.
"don't dilly-dally with the excuse that his majesty did not decree which month parliament should sit," he said in a statement on thursday.
"the government's announcement in the national recovery plan that parliament can reopen come september or october is not a guarantee," said mr mohammad.
such a reopening, he said, was subject to various conditions including drops in the number of daily new cases, and an increase in the vaccination rates.
"whatever excuse to delay the reopening of parliament is not just anti-democratic, but also touches the sanctity and wisdom of the royal institution, which is free and above politics," he added.
the opposition pakatan harapan coalition also called on mr muhyiddin to advise the king to reconvene parliament at the soonest.
"if the prime minister continues to dally, or gives excuses to delay parliament session, it does not just mean he has set aside his majesty's view.
it also gives the impression that the prime minister has lost confidence to continue governing," said the ph statement.
it added that if the prime minister still refuses to advise the king soon, he should take the honorable step by resigning.
among state governments, selangor chief minister amirudin shari announced on thursday that he would meet with the state assembly speaker to begin plans to reconvene the legislature, including obtaining assent from the state ruler.

kuala lumpur, malaysia — de facto law minister takiyuddin hassan has come under fire from members of the public for stating that the king did not specify when parliament should reconvene, after his majesty had called for sittings to resume "as soon as possible".
comptroller of the royal household, ahmad fadil shamsuddin, in a statement from the national palace on wednesday (16 june), said that al-sultan abdullah ri'ayatuddin al-mustafa billah shah recognises parliament's role as "an important platform" for elected representatives to discuss various issues of public importance, including the covid-19 in the country.
"his majesty is of the opinion that having a stable and solid government that can effectively manage the covid-19 pandemic and rehabilitate the nation's economy is imperative," the statement read.
allowing parliament to reconvene will enable members of parliament (mps) to discuss pressing matters such as the government's spending allocation for the purpose of assisting the people, especially those who are currently facing economic hardship as a result of the pandemic and the restrictions imposed because of it.
"after deliberating on the views of political leaders as well as those of the independent commission on the emergency 2021 and experts from government agencies, his majesty expressed the view that parliament sittings must be held as soon as possible," said the comptroller.
this is to enable mps to debate the emergency ordinances and the national recovery plan, he said.
the palace's announcement came after al-sultan abdullah chaired a special meeting with the council of rulers on wednesday.
takiyuddin in a discussion with bicara harakah the same day, however, said: "his majesty did not specify any particular date .
.
.
he said it should be held as soon as possible.
so the prime minister can announce, for example, that parliament will reopen in september or october.
"takiyuddin also said that the number of people to be admitted into the parliament physical space has to be taken into consideration when deliberating on the reopening of the house.
"you need to take into account the number of people who will be present.
a closed area like the dewan rakyat could accommodate 222 mps.
but what about the government officers on duty, the heralds for the speaker, deputy speaker, and secretary to the dewan rakyat?"
he questioned.
takiyuddin added that members of the public present outside the halls and parliament staff must also be taken into view when considering whether to allow parliament to reconvene at this stage.
"we have been informed that every time parliament convenes, there are at least 1,000 people on the grounds," he said, noting that such is why only a hybrid parliament configuration would be feasible at this point.
"this way, we will determine who will attend the sittings as well as the number of mps attending, among other (criteria).
in tandem with parliamentary rules, the minimum quorum needed for the dewan rakyat and dewan negara would be 26 mps and 10 senators, respectively," said takiyuddin.
legal issues, however, may pose barriers to even a hybrid parliament configuration.
"the standing orders state that attendance by mps must be physical, and those not in attendance physically cannot vote," said takiyuddin.
for a hybrid parliament to be materialised, said takiyuddin, amendments must be made to the standing orders.
"so this hybrid parliament needs to be studied and prepared for.
but i wish to stress that the government remains committed to the democratic process involving parliament.
"the prime minister has stated that the government will reconvene parliament once it is confident that standard operating procedures can be met.
it is not that we do not wish to reopen parliament, but it will be done in accordance with the new norms," takiyuddin said.
many commenters criticised takiyuddin's remarks in the livestream, asking why the minister appears to be challenging the royal opinion and "shifting the goalposts" by stating that "as soon as possible" could mean some time in september.
the "goalposts" remark was made in reference to takiyuddin's response to the dewan rakyat's deputy speaker, azalina othman said's statement on the cabinet's role in advising the king regarding the emergency.
the government, she said, should not "shift the goalposts" just as the emergency period approaches the finish line.
"no one is shifting the goalposts, what's being done is adjusting the rules of the game to help the referee make the right judgement.
'to achieve goals does not mean to change the goal post'," said takiyuddin in a tweet on 12 june.
tiada siapa yang alih tiang gol, yang dibuat adalah betulkan peraturan permainan supaya membantu referee buat pengadilan yang betul.
"to achieve goals does not mean to change the goal post".

""the king asked for parliament to reconvene immediately to enable the emergency to be discussed and debated by members of parliament.
that has to be prioritised.

"this government has failed to the point of forcing his majesty to call a meeting with the malay rulers and other parties to discuss the nation's future," one commenter said.
"ministers have received two doses of (the covid-19) vaccine.

so don't give stupid excuses to avoid reopening parliament," said one commenter.
"who are you to question (the king's decree).

one commenter questioned the need for a hybrid parliament — one comprising physical and virtual sittings — saying that many others do not have the option to work online.
"just go.
thousands of factory workers come (to work as usual).
seems ok," they said.
"what is there to be proud of with receiving many ventilators during the emergency when cases are spiking simultaneously?

during the total lockdown, most economic sectors remain closed, except for essential services such as supermarkets and pharmacies.
as a result, many people whose professions do not offer the option to work from home are placed on unpaid leave or are even laid off.
last week, the king had a succession of physical meetings with political leaders such as umno president ahmad zahid hamidi and leaders from the pakatan harapan coalition.
ahmad zahid said on 11 june that he had mooted the prospect during his hour-long audience with sultan abdullah "to ensure the country's democratic system is defended".
"it was obvious that even without the emergency, the government could previously handle matters related to fighting the covid-19 pandemic," he added.
while calling for an end to the emergency, the bagan datuk mp also proposed the resumption of parliament sittings.
"umno believes that parliament is an important official platform to voice the people's concerns (on matters such) such as loan moratoriums, i-sinar and i-lestari 2.
0 and other forms of assistance for everyone," he said.
ahmad zahid is one of several politicians who have openly spoken up against the state of emergency and the suspension of parliament, the latter of which is enabled by the former.
parti keadilan rakyat president anwar ibrahim in january filed a suit against muhyiddin and the federal government, on the grounds that the latter had allegedly advised the nation's king to suspend parliament sittings during the state of emergency.
malay mail reported that in a separate statement filed in court, anwar had argued that the suspension of parliament under emergency powers blocks parliament's freedom to ensure transparent debates, government accountability, and proper checks and balances on the executive branch of the government in making and enacting laws during the pandemic.
anwar was also one of the politicians who have met with the king this week.
he was granted an audience with sultan abdullah with parti amanah negara president mohamad sabu and democratic action party (dap) secretary-general lim guan eng — all component parties of the pakatan harapan coalition.
former prime minister mahathir mohamad, whose parti pejuang tanah air political party has yet to be registered, also had a meeting with the king, during which he proposed the setting up of a national operations council (mageran) in the present circumstances.
mageran was set up after the 13 may racial riots in 1969 to restore the rule of law and order in the country.
several political leaders have since challenged dr mahathir's proposal to establish mageran.
ahmad zahid told reporters that the idea of mageran should have been brought forth at the start of the emergency period.
he added that he did not discuss the mageran issue with the king.
"i feel it is something normal outside the scope of the existing situation because the emergency is supposed to cover it but it has been used to achieve other purposes," said ahmad zahid.
in a joint statement, anwar, mohamad sabu, and lim said that their objection is grounded in their belief that for a parliamentary democracy to truly function, the emergency must be lifted and parliament must be allowed to reconvene.
"the solution to the people's problems in relation to covid-19, the economy and even politics requires a democracy that functions well, and the best avenue to hear out their grievances and to find solutions to them is parliament," they said.
prime minister muhyiddin yassin earlier in march defended the emergency proclamation, stating that it is not a tool for him to cling on to his position but a pre-emptive move in managing the covid-19 situation in the country.
the emergency would be lifted earlier than its scheduled end on 1 august if the government is able to control the pandemic situation in the country, he added.
"if the independent special committee says [the emergency] can be put to an end earlier, i will just follow that.
we also do not want to be under restriction by such regulations forever," said muhyiddin.

since it was declared, federal parliamentary sessions and state legislative assemblies have not sat.
no elections were held during this period.
the state of emergency allows the king to proclaim several emergency ordinances on matters related to private hospital assets; temporary ownership of land, buildings or moveable properties of private hospitals; or to request to use the resources of private hospitals to treat patients.
the government can also seek a more inclusive involvement from the private sector including private healthcare facilities to help ease the burden of government agencies, especially public hospitals.
the suspension of parliament was seen as a move that helped prime minister muhyiddin yassin avoid an immediate challenge to his razor-thin majority in the august house.
opposition leaders have pleaded with the king againstextending the state of emergencyand called for parliament to reconvene.
on tuesday, mr muhyiddin said parliament could reconvene in september or october this year during the third phase of a national recovery plan.
"i wish to give my commitment that the parliament meeting can be held in this phase, around september or october, with tight standard operating procedures (sops) in place," he said whenunveiling the plan which comprises four phases in a televised address.

kuala lumpur, malaysia — malaysia's king said wednesday that parliament, which has been suspended under a coronavirus emergency since january, must resume as soon as possible, but stopped short of saying the emergency should end.
the monarch's comments contrasted with those of prime minister muhyiddin yassin, who said a day earlier that parliament can only reopen if new coronavirus infections fall below 2,000 per day and 40% of the population is fully vaccinated.
he predicted that could be in september or october.
king sultan abdullah sultan ahmad shah said he believes parliament "needs to resume as soon as possible" after consulting with various political leaders, an independent committee advising him on the emergency, and various experts.
he said in a statement issued by the palace that lawmakers should be able to discuss the government's spending allocations to help citizens in distress and efforts to bolster economic recovery.
sultan abdullah approved muhyiddin's emergency plan in early january.
the plan was slammed by critics as a political ruse to help the embattled prime minister stay in power amid challenges to his leadership.
the emergency, which is due to end aug.  1, suspends parliament but includes no other measures.
muhyiddin's government remains in control and has extraordinary powers to introduce laws without parliamentary approval.
it is unclear if muhyiddin's comments tuesday were an indication that he plans to seek an extension of the emergency.
if he does, the king's remarks wednesday mean the monarch is unlikely to approve it.
the palace statement came after the king met wednesday with the conference of rulers, comprising nine ethnic malay state rulers.
in a blow to muhyiddin, they issued a separate strongly worded statement saying the emergency hasn't helped curb the pandemic and needn't be extended beyond aug.  1. the rulers supported growing calls for parliament to resume swiftly, saying the government must be accountable to the people in terms of its spending and that efforts to fight the pandemic must not be seen as having a hidden political agenda.
muhyiddin took power in march 2020 after instigating the collapse of mahathir's reformist alliance that won 2018 elections and joining with the opposition to form a malay-centric government.
but his government is shaky with a razor-thin majority in parliament.
muhyiddin faces challenges from within his coalition and from the opposition, but support for his leadership cannot be tested with parliament suspended.
critics noted daily infections surged to more than 9,000 last month, nearly five times as much as when the emergency was imposed, forcing the government to impose a large-scale lockdown since june that banned social and business activities.
new infections still exceed 5,000 a day, with the country's confirmed total breaching 673,000 and deaths exceeding 4,100. the malay rulers play a largely ceremonial role but have been vocal in politics recently.
they are highly regarded by the country's malay majority as the guardians of islam and malay tradition.
the king and state rulers said vaccinations are key and urged the government to reduce bureaucracy and accelerate efforts to achieve its aim of inoculating up to 80% of the country's 33 million people.
just over 10% of the population has now been vaccinated.
the king had already said in february that parliament can convene despite the emergency order, but muhyiddin's government argued it wasn't safe because there are many older lawmakers.

kuala lumpur prime minister muhyiddin yassin's plan to convene parliament as late as october was dented on wednesday (june 16) after malaysia's king called for the federal legislative to meet "as soon as possible" to debate emergency laws and the nation's exit strategy from its worst covid-19 outbreak.
this was swiftly followed by a joint statement from the malay rulers nine state monarchs who rotate five-year terms as the federation's king expressing the view that the emergency, which suspends the need for legislatures to reconvene every six months, need not be extended beyond its aug 1 expiry date.
the statements were issued after a special meeting between sultan abdullah ahmad shah and eight other heads of state on thursday afternoon, a culmination of a week-long series of audiences the king gave to 18 party chiefs and experts over the pandemic and the emergency.
"his majesty expressed the opinion that a parliament sitting must be held as soon as possible.
.
.
parliament is an important platform for elected representatives to discuss various issues relating to the covid-19 pandemic," the palace said.
his fellow sovereigns concurred, adding that they were of "one mind" that "there is no need to place the nation under emergency rule after aug 1".
however, it is the king who has to assent or reject the government's advice on an emergency, and sultan abdullah was silent on the matter of an extension in his statement.
it is not known if tan sri muhyiddin himself raised the issue in his audience with the king on tuesday or in previous meetings.
nonetheless, a source close to one of the royal households noted "the reason it's made that way is the issue (of an emergency) is not within the jurisdiction of the council of rulers, but the king", hence the opinion is not expressed by sultan abdullah so that his discretion may be reserved.
both the king and the other rulers also issued separate statements last october, when the government's initial request for an emergency was rejected.
while sultan abdullah said such a decree was not necessary then, he called on politicians to ensure the passage of budget 2021 to ensure the nation's fight against covid-19 would not be undermined.
the other rulers, however, stressed on "justice and limiting any element of abuse of power".
parliament last sat in december to narrowly approve this year's budget and mr muhyiddin's tenuous grip on a legislative majority has not been tested since, raising questions over his legitimacy.
the emergency, which came into effect on jan 11, was imposed as malaysia struggled to contain the coronavirus outbreak after a spike in september.
but critics say it has only entrenched the muhyiddin administration, whose parliamentary majority remains in doubt after a series of defections in both directions, as measures to tackle the disease did not require an emergency.
the fact that may saw the most covid-19 deaths in a month has further fuelled the view that the emergency has not helped the fight against the pandemic.
mr muhyiddin had on tuesday unveiled his national recovery plan, which outlines criteria in terms of daily infections, healthcare capacity and vaccination rates for the government to progressively loosen an ongoing lockdown.
"i pledge my commitment that the parliamentary session can convene.
.
.
around the months of september or october, subject to stringent sops (standard operating procedures)," he had said.
"my stance from the very beginning has always been that the democratic parliamentary system should be able to function once again after the covid-19 cases are well under control and when we are close to achieving herd immunity.
"but both the king and his fellow rulers indicated the importance of "a government that is stable and enjoys public confidence and support of the majority".
the royal statements have spurred opponents like umno president ahmad zahid hamidi, whose party wants to withdraw from government and force polls it believes will result in its return to dominance.
"umno supports and views seriously his majesty's call for the need to establish a stable and strong government that is capable of functioning effectively in addressing covid-19 and reviving the economy," he said in an immediate response.
opposition leader anwar ibrahim said: "i await the next step from the government led by muhyiddin yassin to call parliament as soon as possible.

                is the article 150 power to declare or revoke an emergency or to set up a national operations council as in 1969 a discretionary or a non-discretionary function?our constitution has invested the yang di-pertuan agong with vast powers and functions in the executive, legislative and judicial fields and in relation to islam.
a computer check indicates that the words "yang di-pertuan agong" occur in the federal constitution 274 times!if all of these 274 mentions indicate the existence of discretionary powers, then his majesty is obviously an absolute and not a constitutional monarch.
it is submitted that the proper approach to constitutional interpretation is that no provision conferring power and function on the king should be interpreted literally or in isolation but must be read in the light of articles 40(1) and 40(1a), which require his majesty to act on advice.
articles 40 and 40(1a) must be grafted onto every article where the words "yang di-pertuan agong" occur unless the provision explicitly confers discretion.
the powers and functions of our king are divisible into two broad categories:> non-discretionary functions, which are exercised on advice and constitute the bulk of his functions.
concerning these, the monarch may advise, caution, warn and delay but must, in the last resort, accept the advice rendered; and> discretionary powers, which are exercised in his own judgment.
the king may consult anyone including his brother rulers, the prime minister, attorney general, respected public or private figures, or any experts he may choose to summon to the palace.
but ultimately, the mantle of responsibility falls on his great shoulders.
discretionary functions are mentioned in article 40(2) and cover the following critical matters of state: appointment of a prime minister; withholding of consent to a request for dissolution of parliament; convening of the conference of rulers; and "any other case mentioned in this constitution".
it is submitted that the words "any other case mentioned in this constitution" must mean "any other case (explicitly) mentioned", for example concerning the appointment of the public service commission under article 139(4); appointment of the education service commission under article 141a(2); appointment of other commission members under article 143(1)(a); and appointment of state governors under the 8th schedule, item 19a.
in several situations, the king's personal discretion is necessarily implied.
these situations are the right under article 40(1) to ask for any information from the government; delaying legislation by 30 days under article 66(4a); appointment of a caretaker prime minister after parliament is dissolved under article 43(2); and appointment of an interim, minority, provisional or unity government if there is a deeply fractured or "hung parliament" with no faction commanding an absolute majority.
in the past few weeks, the question on many lips is whether the article 150 power to declare or revoke an emergency or to set up a national operations council as in 1969 is a discretionary or non-discretionary function.
it is submitted that the king's emergency powers are exercisable on advice.
despite the subjective language of clause (1) of article 150 ("if the yang di-pertuan agong is satisfied"), it is noticeable that nowhere in article 150 is there any explicit mention of personal discretion.
in several court cases, like stephen kalong ningkan v tun abang haji openg and tawi sli (no 2) (1967), m madhavan nair (1975), and teh cheng poh (1979), it has been ruled that emergency powers are subject to article 40(1).
in teh cheng poh, there is this telling statement from the privy council that when one finds in the constitution or federal law powers conferred upon the yang di-pertuan agong that are expressed to be exercisable if he is of opinion or is satisfied, the reference to his opinion or satisfaction is, in reality, a reference to the collective opinion or satisfaction of members of the cabinet.
despite the above judicial decisions, there are contrasting views that article 150 powers are independent of the prime minister's advice.
these views are anchored on several facts.
first, in 1983, then prime minister datuk seri dr mahathir mohamad pushed through parliament the constitution (amendment) act 1983, which amended article 150 to read: "if the prime minister is satisfied that a grave emergency exists he shall advise the yang di-pertuan agong accordingly and the yang di-pertuan agong shall then issue a proclamation".
this amendment elicited strong opposition from the conference of rulers and was repealed in early 1984. the story behind the repeal lends credence to the view that emergency powers under article 150 are not subject to the prime minister's advice and are personal to the monarch.
second, in october 2020, the present yang di-pertuan agong is known to have refused the prime minister's advice to proclaim an emergency.
the refusal was not challenged in a court of law by the prime minister and sets a political precedent of the throne supplying a check and balance against the political executive's use of emergency powers.
third, the emergency ordinance of jan 14, this year, in section 2 establishes an "independent special committee" appointed by the king "to advise the yang di-pertuan agong on the continuing existence of the grave emergency".
why have this independent committee if the king is bound by cabinet advice?fourth, in the case of pp v mohd amin mohd razali (2000), the learned judge, zulkefli j. , suggested that in relation to article 150's emergency powers, though the king is bound by the advice of the prime minister, the prime minister whose advice is binding on the king must be one with democratic legitimacy in parliament.
on may 15, 1969, there was no parliament and the prime minister was a caretaker prime minister without parliamentary backing.
the judge ruled that in some circumstances, like during the dissolution of parliament when the prime minister is a mere caretaker, the king is not bound by the advice of the prime minister and can act independently.
perhaps the mohd amin mohd razali precedent will also apply if the prime minister is an interim prime minister (like dr mahathir was in february 2020).
what about our circumstances today?there is a duly appointed prime minister and cabinet in place.
an emergency is in operation.
under section 11 of the ordinance of jan 14, the prime minister and cabinet have the security of tenure as long as the emergency lasts, i. e.  till aug 1. parliament is in suspension under section 14 of the ordinance.
but on aug 1, the laws about parliament to reconvene will kick in.
the guarantee of security of tenure for the prime minister will expire.
it is a matter of conjecture whether the prime minister will seek an extension of the emergency.
what if the prime minister faces a vote of no-confidence in the reconvened house (or if the house is not in session), a challenge to his authority under the datuk seri nizar jamaluddin precedent of 2009 in perak?is the king entitled under the constitution's spirit of parliamentary democracy to advise the prime minister to settle the issue of confidence first before seeking an extension to the existing emergency proclamation or the issuance of a new one?what if, after aug 1, the prime minister loses a vote of no-confidence in the house and nobody else can secure a stable majority in the "hung parliament"?will this be a ground for the king to act independently to proclaim a new emergency due to the collapse of civil government and to set up a national operations council?these are untested and untried issues.
what adds further complexity is that under article 150(8), the satisfaction of the yang di-pertuan agong cannot be challenged in a court of law.

                international trade and industry minister datuk seri mohamed azmin ali (right) and penang chief minister chow kon yeow (center) having a light moment with factory worker ong hock keah, 48 at the vaccination centre (ppv) under the program imunisasi industri covid-19 kerjasama awam-swasta (pikas) at bukit jawi golf resort in nibong tebal, penang, thursday.
nibong tebal: the yang di-pertuan agong's call for parliament to reconvene as soon as possible is in line with the government's intentions, says datuk seri azmin ali.
the senior minister said the government has all the while intended to reconvene parliament when the time is right.
"the government constantly ensures that all actions or efforts taken within the past one year are in accordance with the federal constitution and the laws of the country.
"in the context of the parliament meeting, the prime minister himself has stated that it will reconvene.
he never said that parliament would not convene.
"for me, the king's call is in line with the government's intention to have the parliament meeting when the time is suitable to ensure democratic processes are upheld," the international trade and industry minister said on thursday (june 17).
he said the country cannot afford to see its healthcare system collapse, adding that continuous efforts to contain the spread of covid-19 have so far been successful.
"we have rolled out two vaccination programmes – the national covid-19 immunisation programme and the public-private partnership immunisation programme for the industries (pikas) – with the aim to accelerate the process towards achieving herd immunity," he said.
azmin added that tan sri muhyiddin yassin had never taken any unilateral action by himself.
"in the national security council meetings, leaders of all states are involved for their views to be heard before decisions are made.
"health director-general tan sri dr noor hisham abdullah had said in may that if we did not take stern action, the number of daily covid-19 cases might reach up to 13, 000, according to forecasts using r-naught (r0) and susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (seir) models.
"but, as you can see, on june 14, only 4, 900 new covid-19 cases were recorded.
"this shows that steps taken by the government to battle covid-19 have been effective," he said.
azmin also said the implementation of the various movement control orders and supporting the healthcare sector through the allocation of billions of ringgit are to ensure that they do not collapse.
"in september, based on the same seir model, dr noor hisham forecast that the number of covid-19 cases might reach up to 40, 000 daily.
"if that happens, our healthcare system will collapse.
"as a responsible government that consults experts for their recommendations before decisions are made, the decisions made are for the priority of the people and country.
"i'm glad that the efforts have resulted in success shared by everyone," said azmin after checking out the pikas programme at bukit jawi golf resort here.
on wednesday (june 16), the king called for parliament to be reconvened as soon as possible.
istana negara comptroller of the royal household datuk ahmad fadil shamsuddin said that yang di-pertuan agong al-sultan abdullah ri'ayatuddin al-mustafa billah shah conveyed this after looking at all the views presented by the political leaders, the special independent committee on emergency and experts as well as government agencies.
a statement issued said it was to allow the emergency ordinance and the national recovery plan to be debated by members of the dewan rakyat.
his majesty also called on the government to act decisively to simplify bureaucracy and speed up the covid-19 vaccination process in order for the country to achieve herd immunity as early as possible.

kuala lumpur: the rulers of malaysia said there is no need to extend a state of emergency beyond aug 1, while calling for the political temperature to be cooled down.
keeper of the rulers' seal syed danial syed ahmad said in a statement on wednesday (jun 16) that the rulers have noted the high number of daily covid-19 cases, although a state of emergency has been proclaimed.
the economic and financial situation of the country was worrying and the political atmosphere is unstable, according to the statement.
"the unity among the people is increasingly cracked," the statement read, adding that people were suffering from job loss and income loss.
the malay rulers reached an agreement that, among others, people's lives and livelihoods must be prioritised, it said.
"the political temperature that is increasingly rising must be cooled down.
"it is important to have a stable government that can command confidence and support of the majority of the people.
"there is no need to place the country under a state of emergency after aug 1, 2021," the statement read.
on wednesday afternoon, king al-sultan abdullah ri'ayatuddin al-mustafa billah shah chaired a special rulers' conference at istana negara, after granting audiences to key political leaders since last week.
in a statement issued after the meeting, the king saidparliamentary sittings should reconvene as soon as possibleso that the emergency ordinances and the national recovery plan can be debated by members of parliament.
the kingfirst declared a state of emergency on jan 12to curb the spread of covid-19.
the emergency was scheduled to last until aug 1 or earlier depending on the state of coronavirus infections.
federal parliamentary sessions and state legislative assemblies have not sat since then, and no elections were held during this period.
the suspension of parliament was seen as a move that helped prime minister muhyiddin yassin avoid an immediate challenge to his razor-thin majority.
mr muhyiddin was appointed to the post following a power tussle in putrajaya last year.
he has since faced leadership challenges not just from the opposition, but also from allies in his perikatan nasional government.
opposition politicians have been criticising the government's handling of the pandemic and called for parliament to sit.
a spike in covid-19 cases has forced the government to implement a total lockdown since jun 1. according to the wednesday statement, the malay rulers were of the opinion that legislature assemblies in their respective states should also convene as soon as possible.
"the assembly methods and procedures currently practised in a few countries, which were proven to be able to curb the spread of the covid-19 virus, should be introduced and accepted in this country," the statement said.

"this is to allow the emergency ordinance and the national recovery plan to be debated by members of the dewan rakyat," read the statement on wednesday (june 16).
the statement follows a special meeting of malay rulers held at istana negara earlier on wednesday to discuss efforts to combat covid-19.
he said his majesty realised the importance of a functioning parliament during the pandemic in order for lawmakers to debate the emergency and the national recovery plan.
"members of the dewan rakyat can also discuss the government's spending to help the rakyat who are facing hardship and to recover the national economy," he said.
he said his majesty also called on the government to act decisively to simplify bureaucracy and speed up the covid-19 vaccination process in order for the country to achieve herd immunity as early as possible.
the king also expressed the need for a strong and stable government administration so it can function effectively in handling the spread of covid-19 and to heal the country's economy, added ahmad fadil.
"his majesty also is of the view that vaccination is the only exit strategy to curb the spread of the covid-19 in the country," said ahmad fadil.
"the king also expressed his highest gratitude for the continuous support of the malay rulers who reflected the concern of the country and for the livelihood of the people," read the statement.
yang di-pertuan agong also expressed his gratitude to frontliners and the rakyat for sacrificing and their efforts to fight the spread of covid-19, added ahmad fadil.
the king also urged the people to continue and pray that the rakyat and the country are protected by allah and will be able to end the pandemic.

kuala lumpur: malaysia's king al-sultan abdullah ri'ayatuddin al-mustafa billah shah said on wednesday (jun 16) that parliamentary sittings should reconvene as soon as possible, after he chaired a special rulers' conference.
a statement issued by the palace said: "after reviewing all the perspectives of the leaders of the political parties, the 2021 independent emergency special committee as well as briefings by experts from government agencies, his majesty expressed the view that parliamentary sessions should be held as soon as possible.
"it added: "this is to enable the emergency ordinances and the national recovery plan to be debated by the members of the house of representatives.

kuala lumpur malaysia's royal rulers have begun arriving at the national palace for a special meeting with the king on wednesday (june 16) to discuss the country's covid-19 crisis.
over the last week, sultan abdullah ahmad shah had granted audiences to political party leaders across the divide to get their views on the government's handling of the outbreak during the ongoing state of emergency, which will expire in six weeks.
the king had met 18 political leaders face to face as well as in virtual sessions from june 9, said a statement issued by the comptroller of the royal household, datuk indera ahmad fadil shamsuddin, on tuesday.
aside from meeting political leaders, the king also granted an audience to the chairman of the special independent committee on the emergency, tun arifin zakaria, at istana negara on tuesday, it said.
experts from various government agencies are scheduled to present briefings on matters related to health, security, politics and the economy during wednesday's meeting at 2.
30pm, which will be the second by the malay rulers to discuss the pandemic, after one was held in october last year.
the state of emergency was declared amid a spike in covid-19 cases in january.
there have been calls for the emergency to be lifted due to the worsening covid-19 health crisis.
the nation is currently under another lockdown after record highs in covid-19 cases and deaths were reported in recent weeks.
last wednesday, opposition leader anwar ibrahim said he had pleaded with the constitutional monarch not to extend the state of emergency, as the move has not helped poorer malaysians.
opposition democratic action party secretary-general lim guan eng, whose party has the most number of mps, told reporters after his audience that the discussion with the king revolved around financial assistance for the people to see them through the outbreak.
as a potential solution to malaysia's crisis, the country's longest-serving premier mahathir mohamad mooted the revival of a council that governed the nation after its deadly may 13, 1969, race riots in his audience with the king last thursday.
dr mahathir claimed the national operations council (mageran), which was in charge for two years during the last national emergency until 1971, allowed malaysia's second prime minister, tun abdul razak hussein, to "solve political problems at the time" by bringing in opposition parties to form a wider barisan nasional (bn) ruling coalition that had a stronger majority.
back then, mageran was made up of a small group of political leaders and top civil servants that included the police and armed forces' chiefs.
dr mahathir suggested including experts on the covid-19 pandemic this time.
pakatan harapan has opposed the idea, while umno has said that it is against extending the emergency.
opponents of prime minister muhyiddin yassin have also called for the resumption of parliament, which last sat in december last year to pass this year's budget, so that the outbreak can be addressed.
the state of emergency suspends the requirement for parliament to reconvene within six months of its last sitting and also ensures the muhyiddin administration remains in power.
tan sri muhyiddin on tuesday unveiled a four-phase post-pandemic exit plan for malaysia, ahead of the monarchs' special talks, projecting that malaysia from september might gradually open up its economy, social sectors and also parliament.
the country has failed to fully recover from a resurgent outbreak arising from sabah state polls in september last year.
in late october, malaysia was reporting some 1,200 covid-19 cases a day.
on tuesday, it recorded 5,419 cases.

kuala lumpur: gabungan parti sarawak (gps), the ruling coalition in the borneo state, highlighted the importance of a "strong and stable government" as one of the crucial factors in the fight against covid-19 in its meeting with the malaysian king on monday (jun 14).
four top leaders from the coalition were the last group to be granted an audience by king al-​sultan abdullah ri'ayatuddin al-mustafa billah shahin a series of meetingswith party chiefs since last wednesday.

"the vaccination programme is to be accelerated and completed by august to achieve herd immunity.
"the presence of a strong and stable government to ensure covid-19 programme and (economic) implementation are well-grounded," the statement read.
the third factor is the implementation of a post-covid-19 economic exit plan, the statement added.
mr abang abdul rahman zohari is the president of parti pesaka bumiputera bersatu (pbb).
the gps was formed in 2018 after the four parties quit barisan nasional following the latter's defeat in the 14th general election.
while not a member of the perikatan nasional coalition, which took over federal administration in a power tussle last year, gps had said that it supported prime minister muhyiddin yassin in the interest of political stability.
the sarawak state election, which was supposed to be held this year, has been postponed as mandated by the state of emergency proclaimed by the king in january.
the palace said king al-​sultan abdullah would meet fellow malay rulers on wednesday to discuss malaysia's efforts to curb the spread of covid-19 and its implementation during the state of emergency.
in last week's royal audiences, leader of the opposition anwar ibrahim pleaded with the kingnot to extend the state of emergency, which was slated to end on aug 1. calling for the same, united malays national organisation president ahmad zahid hamidi said the party also wantedthe parliament to reconvene.

source: the sun dailykuala lumpur, malaysia — the united malays national organisation (umno) is opposed to any extension of the current state of emergency in malaysia, says party president ahmad zahid hamidi after an audience with king al-sultan abdullah on friday (11 june).
ahmad zahid told reporters outside the national palace here today that he had mooted the prospect during his hour-long audience with sultan abdullah "to ensure the country's democratic system is defended".
"it was obvious that even without the emergency, the government could previously handle matters related to fighting the covid-19 pandemic," he added.
while calling for an end to the emergency, the bagan datuk member of parliament (mp) also proposed the resumption of parliament sittings.
"umno believes that parliament is an important official platform to voice the people's concerns (on matters such) such as loan moratoriums, i-sinar and i-lestari 2.
0 and other forms of assistance for everyone," he said.
ahmad zahid is one of several politicians who have openly spoken up against the state of emergency and the suspension of parliament, the latter of which is enabled by the former.
parti keadilan rakyat president anwar ibrahim in january filed a suit against muhyiddin and the federal government, on the grounds that the latter had allegedly advised the nation's king to suspend parliament sittings during the state of emergency.
malay mail reported that in a separate statement filed in court, anwar had argued that the suspension of parliament under emergency powers blocks parliament's freedom to ensure transparent debates, government accountability, and proper checks and balances on the executive branch of the government in making and enacting laws during the pandemic.
anwar was also one of the politicians who have met with the king this week.
he was granted an audience with sultan abdullah with parti amanah negara president mohamad sabu and democratic action party (dap) secretary-general lim guan eng — all component parties of the pakatan harapan coalition.
former prime minister mahathir mohamad, whose parti pejuang tanah air political party has yet to be registered, also had a meeting with the king, during which he proposed the setting up of a national operations council (mageran) in the present circumstances.
mageran was set up after the 13 may racial riots in 1969 to restore the rule of law and order in the country.
several political leaders have since challenged dr mahathir's proposal to establish mageran.
ahmad zahid told reporters that the idea of mageran should have been brought forth at the start of the emergency period.
he added that he did not discuss the mageran issue with the king.
"i feel it is something normal outside the scope of the existing situation because the emergency is supposed to cover it but it has been used to achieve other purposes," said ahmad zahid.
in a joint statement on friday, anwar, mohamad sabu, and lim said that their objection is grounded in their belief that for a parliamentary democracy to truly function, the emergency must be lifted and parliament must be allowed to reconvene.
"the solution to the people's problems in relation to covid-19, the economy and even politics requires a democracy that functions well, and the best avenue to hear out their grievances and to find solutions to them is parliament," they said.
klang mp charles santiago also called for the end of the emergency and for parliament sittings to resume via both physical and virtual means.
in a tweet on friday, the dap politician wrote: "don't make a mockery of parliamentary democracy.
end emergency, reconvene parliament via physical & virtual sessions.
"santiago also expressed his objection against mageran in the same tweet, saying: "no to noc.
"don't make a mockery of parliamentary democracy.
end emergency, reconvene parliament via physical & virtual sessions.
no to noc.
— charles santiago (@mpklang) june 11, 2021prime minister muhyiddin yassin in march defended the emergency proclamation, stating that it is not a tool for him to cling on to his position but a pre-emptive move in managing the covid-19 situation in the country.
the emergency would be lifted earlier than its scheduled end on 1 august if the government is able to control the pandemic situation in the country, he added.
"if the independent special committee says [the emergency] can be put to an end earlier, i will just follow that.
we also do not want to be under restriction by such regulations forever," said muhyiddin.
sultan abdullah is slated to discuss the emergency and the covid-19 situation with eight other rulers in a special conference next wednesday (16 june).
the king's succession of physical meetings with political leaders this week is set to end on friday.
he is slated to have a virtual meeting with sarawak's ruling party gabungan parti sarawak on monday.

kuala lumpur: united malays national organisation (umno) has pleaded with the king to not extend malaysia's state of emergency beyond aug 1, its president ahmad zahid hamidi said after an audience with the ruler on friday (jun 11).
the party also wanted the parliament to reconvene again to ensure that the country's "democratic system can be defended", ahmad zahid told journalists outside the palace.
umno's stance echoed that of leader of the opposition anwar ibrahim, who called for the state of emergency to end as scheduled in his meeting with king al-sultan abdullah ri'ayatuddin al-mustafa billah shah.
al-sultan abdullah has been summoning political party leaders to the palace for meetings this week.
he first met with prime minister muhyiddin yassin for a pre-cabinet meeting, and then granted audiences to mr anwar, parti amanah negara president mohamad sabu and democratic action party secretary-general lim guan eng on wednesday.

al-sultan abdullah had earlier declared a nationwide state of emergency back in january to curb the spread of covid-19.
parliament, state legislative assemblies and elections are suspended, while economic activities are allowed to continue.
malaysia's covid-19 numbers have continued to rise since january, and as of friday, total caseload stood at 646,411 cases, with 79,848 active cases and 3,684 deaths.
with the parliamentary suspension, the legitimacy of mr muhyiddin's perikatan nasional government formed following a power tussle in february and march last year cannot be challenged in the august house.
mr muhyiddin had said he would advise the king to dissolve the parliament once the pandemic is under control.
speaking to journalists on friday, ahmad zahid said the damage of a prolonged state of emergency would be "too great for the country".
"and it was obvious that even without the emergency, the government could previously handle matters related to fighting the covid-19 pandemic," he said.
ahmad zahid, who is bagan datuk mp, added that parliament meetings would ensure that the government administration is held accountable through checks and balances.
"umno is of the opinion that the parliament is an important official platform to voice the people's grouses, such as moratorium, increasing price of goods, i-sinar and i-lestari 2.
0 and other assistance for everyone," he said, referring to the retirement fund withdrawal programmes.
on dr mahathir's proposal to set up a national operations council to take over the country's administration, ahmad zahid said this was not discussed in his meeting with the king.
the council, better known by its malay abbreviation mageran, was an emergency administrative body established to restore the rule of law in malaysia after the may 13 racial riots in 1969. the opposition alliance pakatan harapan has rejected the proposal on friday, and reiterated its stance that the state of emergency should end immediately and the parliament should reconvene.
meanwhile, the palace said the king is due to meet with the other malay rulers next wednesday for a special discussion on the efforts to fight covid-19 and their implementation during the state of emergency.
