beijing: at least 12 people were killed and nearly 140 others injured when a gas line explosion ripped through a residential compound in central china's hubei province on sunday (jun 13), local officials said.
rescue efforts were continuing, according to a statement from the disaster management bureau in the city of shiyan, although it was unclear how many people may still be trapped under the debris.
the explosion took place at about 6.
30am and an investigation was under way to determine the cause of the blast, the statement said.
responders sent 138 people to hospital, of which 37 were critically injured, according to a statement on the city's official website.
videos shot by witnesses and verified by beijing news show several buildings reduced to rubble and rescue workers carrying shocked survivors on stretchers.
the blast ripped through one of the city's vegetable markets that was filled with shoppers and local residents eating breakfast, an eyewitness told state-run global times.
"i heard a loud bang and immediately ducked under the table, thinking it was an earthquake," a man who owns a small restaurant near the explosion site told the newspaper.
state broadcaster cctv showed footage of buildings with charred walls and shattered windows.
rescuers are seen raking through the debris with shovels and gloved hands.
people can be seen walking in a rubble-strewn street between damaged buildings.
images also show rescuers climbing over broken concrete slabs to reach those trapped inside.
the blast occurred in a two-storey building that earlier housed a vehicle frame manufacturer.
several survivors told local media that the gas pipeline had fallen into disrepair after the factory was moved last year.
"in march, workers from the gas company came and asked whether i got a smell of gas," one survivor who runs a stall in the market told local website health times.
"after asking around (with) people they just left.
"around 900 residents in the area have been evacuated as surrounding buildings may have been damaged by the blast, the city government said.
about 2,000 rescue workers have been deployed on the site.
images verified by health times show a firefighter who was also injured and a fire truck damaged by a second, smaller blast.
the severely injured were airlifted to bigger hospitals.
long lines of volunteers were seen outside blood banks as local hospitals put out a call for donors.
the ministry of emergency management has also sent a team to assist with the rescue operation.
in a rare move, chinese president xi jinping issued a statement urging local officials to "learn profound lessons from the incident" and double down on efforts to prevent such incidents.
"all regions and relevant departments must draw lessons from one another .
.
.
investigate various safety hazards and prevent major emergencies," he said.
industrial accidents are common in china due to weak safety standards and corruption among officials tasked with enforcing them.
the blast came a day after eight people were killed and three others injured when toxic methyl formate leaked from a chemical handling facility in the southwestern city of guiyang.
among the worst accidents was a massive 2015 explosion at a chemical warehouse in the port city of tianjin that killed 173 people, most of them firefighters and police officers.
the blast was blamed on illegal construction and unsafe storage of volatile materials.

singapore a man was found dead at the building site of an upcoming warehouse on thursday (june 10) after falling some 40m, the equivalent of 14 floors of a housing block.
the 25-year-old bangladeshi was working on the building of a stairwell at the site, and was crossing the gap between the stairwell's walls when a structure used to bridge the gap gave way, causing him to plunge to his death, a spokesman for the ministry of manpower (mom) said on saturday.

singapore: a board of inquiry has been appointed to investigate the death of an smrt technician who was pinned under a bus he was repairing.
the inquiry will be chaired by an smrt board member, mr quek gim pew,together with an independent mechanical engineering expert, associated professor patrick chua from the singapore institute of technology, the public transport operator said on friday (jun 11).
smrt was also assisting the singapore police force and manpower ministry in their separate investigations, it said in a facebook post.
the incident took place at the ang mo kio depot of smrt automotive services on the morning of jun 6.  the technician who died was a 43-year-old permanent resident.
he was one of three technicians inspecting and repairing a loose steering wheel on a mini-bus, said smrt on friday.
the technicians used two car jacks to lift the front of the mini-bus and two of them performed repair works under the vehicle, said the company.
the two technicians were injured and immediately taken to the hospital, where one later died.
the other injured worker has been discharged and was on medical leave, said smrt.
"our immediate priority has and continues to be to provide support to the deceased's family and to provide counselling and support to our recovering technician," said the company.
after the incident, an immediate safety time-out was implemented at all automotive services workshops, it said.
all lifting equipment was inspected and staff briefings on work instructions and safety guidelines were conducted, it added.
a workplace safety and health (wsh) council alert on jun 9 stated that the workers had raised a bus using two car jacks and were working under the vehicle when one of the jacks suddenly collapsed.
the wsh council said car jacks should not be used to lift heavy vehicles such as buses and lorries.
jacking equipment for heavy vehicles should be used instead.
vehicle stands and props should also be used to provide additional support.
where available, a vehicle maintenance pit or purpose-built vehicle ramp or lift should be used, it said.
smrt on friday said it would provide further updates in due course.

singapore smrt has appointed a board of inquiry to look into a fatal accident at its automotive services workshop in the ang mo kio depot on sunday (june 6).
it is chaired by its board member quek gim pew and an independent mechanical engineering expert, associate professor patrick chua from the singapore institute of technology.
in the sunday incident, one technician was killed and another injured when a car jack supporting a minibus they were working on gave way.
the transport operator said in a facebook post on friday that three technicians had attended to the inspection and rectification of  the vehicle's loose steering wheel.
they used two car jacks to lift the front of the minibus and two of them proceeded with repair works under it.
in a preliminary update on the workplace incident, smrt said the two workers were injured and taken to hospital, where one of them died.
the other has been discharged and is on medical leave.
police said they received a call at around 9.
40am on sunday.
a 44-year-old man was conscious when taken to hospital, it added.
another man, 43, was unconscious.
the two technicians were taken to khoo teck puat hospital in yishun, said the singapore civil defence force, adding that one had serious head injuries while the other complained of chest pains.
smrt said its immediate priority is to provide support to the family of the dead worker, and offer counselling and support to the recovering technician.
following the incident, an immediate safety time-out was implemented at all automotive services workshops.
all lifting equipment were inspected while staff briefings on work instructions and safety guidelines were held.
smrt said it is assisting the police and ministry of manpower in their separate investigations.
the workplace safety and health council on thursday said such accidents could be prevented if proper jacking equipment designed for the load of the vehicle were used.
car jacks designed to support a fraction of the weight of a bus should not be tapped.
it added that additional stands or props should be used to provide further support when lifting heavy vehicles like buses, trucks and lorries.
"where available, use a vehicle maintenance pit or purpose-built vehicle ramp or lift to safely access the bottom of a vehicle," the council stated.
sunday's incident is the second workplace fatality for smrt in two years.
in march last year, a technical officer died while working at the bishan depot.
mr muhammad afiq senawi, 30, was operating a hydraulic press machine when a 5kg rod flew out, broke through fencing and hit him in the face.
these incidents followed other serious worksite mishaps at smrt.
in 2016, two trainees aged 24 and 26 were killed on a track near pasir ris mrt station.
in 2018, a 59-year-old worker had his right foot amputated after it was crushed by a maintenance train.
the 2016 tragedy was found to have been caused by a failure to impose safety protocols while the cause of the other incident has not yet been made known.

singapore: a board of inquiry has been appointed to investigate the death of an smrt technician who was pinned under a bus he was repairing.
the inquiry will be chaired by an smrt board member, mr quek gim pew,together with an independent mechanical engineering expert, associated professor patrick chua from the singapore institute of technology, the public transport operator said on friday (jun 11).
smrt was also assisting the singapore police force and manpower ministry in their separate investigations, it said in a facebook post.
the incident took place at the ang mo kio depot of smrt automotive services on the morning of jun 6.  the technician who died was a 43-year-old permanent resident.
he was one of three technicians inspecting and repairing a loose steering wheel on a mini-bus, said smrt on friday.
the technicians used two car jacks to lift the front of the mini-bus and two of them performed repair works under the vehicle, said the company.
the two technicians were injured and immediately taken to the hospital, where one later died.
the other injured worker has been discharged and was on medical leave, said smrt.
"our immediate priority has and continues to be to provide support to the deceased's family and to provide counselling and support to our recovering technician," said the company.
after the incident, an immediate safety time-out was implemented at all automotive services workshops, it said.
all lifting equipment was inspected and staff briefings on work instructions and safety guidelines were conducted, it added.
a workplace safety and health (wsh) council alert on jun 9 stated that the workers had raised a bus using two car jacks and were working under the vehicle when one of the jacks suddenly collapsed.
the wsh council said car jacks should not be used to lift heavy vehicles such as buses and lorries.
jacking equipment for heavy vehicles should be used instead.
vehicle stands and props should also be used to provide additional support.
where available, a vehicle maintenance pit or purpose-built vehicle ramp or lift should be used, it said.
smrt on friday said it would provide further updates in due course.

singapore smrt has appointed a board of inquiry to look into a fatal accident at its automotive services workshop in the ang mo kio depot on sunday (june 6).
it is chaired by its board member quek gim pew and an independent mechanical engineering expert, associate professor patrick chua from the singapore institute of technology.
in the sunday incident, one technician was killed and another injured when a car jack supporting a minibus they were working on gave way.
the transport operator said in a facebook post on friday that three technicians had attended to the inspection and rectification of  the vehicle's loose steering wheel.
they used two car jacks to lift the front of the minibus and two of them proceeded with repair works under it.
in a preliminary update on the workplace incident, smrt said the two workers were injured and taken to hospital, where one of them died.
the other has been discharged and is on medical leave.
police said they received a call at around 9.
40am on sunday.
a 44-year-old man was conscious when taken to hospital, it added.
another man, 43, was unconscious.
the two technicians were taken to khoo teck puat hospital in yishun, said the singapore civil defence force, adding that one had serious head injuries while the other complained of chest pains.
smrt said its immediate priority is to provide support to the family of the dead worker, and offer counselling and support to the recovering technician.
following the incident, an immediate safety time-out was implemented at all automotive services workshops.
all lifting equipment were inspected while staff briefings on work instructions and safety guidelines were held.
smrt said it is assisting the police and ministry of manpower in their separate investigations.
the workplace safety and health council on thursday said such accidents could be prevented if proper jacking equipment designed for the load of the vehicle were used.
car jacks designed to support a fraction of the weight of a bus should not be tapped.
it added that additional stands or props should be used to provide further support when lifting heavy vehicles like buses, trucks and lorries.
"where available, use a vehicle maintenance pit or purpose-built vehicle ramp or lift to safely access the bottom of a vehicle," the council stated.
sunday's incident is the second workplace fatality for smrt in two years.
in march last year, a technical officer died while working at the bishan depot.
mr muhammad afiq senawi, 30, was operating a hydraulic press machine when a 5kg rod flew out, broke through fencing and hit him in the face.
these incidents followed other serious worksite mishaps at smrt.
in 2016, two trainees aged 24 and 26 were killed on a track near pasir ris mrt station.
in 2018, a 59-year-old worker had his right foot amputated after it was crushed by a maintenance train.
the 2016 tragedy was found to have been caused by a failure to impose safety protocols while the cause of the other incident has not yet been made known.
