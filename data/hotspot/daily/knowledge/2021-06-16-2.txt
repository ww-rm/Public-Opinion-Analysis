singapore a thousand front-line workers at changi airport will receive ez-link cards with a stored value of $50 as a gift next month.
the move to help with their transport costs is the result of a ground-up initiative by about 70 civil aviation authority of singapore (caas) officers who wanted to show their appreciation for the workers.
calling themselves friends for aviation (ffa), the group of officers said on saturday (june 12) that cleaners, trolley and baggage handlers will be among the workers to benefit.
ffa said that some of these workers now needed to travel more often for their routine covid-19 testing, following stepped-up measures at the airport last month to guard against another cluster of covid-19 cases emerging.
a total of 43 workers at changi tested positive for covid-19 last month.
this resulted in the closure of the terminal buildings to the public for an initial two weeks.
the closure has now been extended indefinitely to allow the airport community to adjust to new safety measures.
ffa's founder, ms angela ng, who works as an aviation policy officer at caas, said the covid-19 outbreak at changi has added to the challenges in the aviation sector, which has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.
"so everybody needs some encouragement, especially our front-liners who don't have the opportunity to work from home to stay safe," she said.
"their jobs and livelihoods are tied to what they do at the front line.
"ffa said it has pooled together $25,000 to fund the ez-link card distribution.
the remaining $25,000 needed will come from temasek trust's oscar @ sg fund, which has agreed to match ffa's contribution on a dollar-for-dollar basis.
caas director-general designate han kok juan said that the initiative complements the $15 million fund that the authority and changi airport group had set aside to help aviation workers.
he praised the initiative as "a great example of the strong community spirit" at changi airport.
members of the public who want to show support to aviation front-liners can submit messages of appreciation and encouragement by june 25.  the messages will be printed and given out together with the ez-link cards.
submission details can be found on the friends for aviation instagram page.

a $15 million sum has been set aside to provide some 5,000 airport workers with a special monthly allowance for six months.
the fund will also be used to cater meals for them during their shifts and to defray the cost of their personal protective equipment, the civil aviation authority of singapore (caas) and changi airport group (cag) said yesterday.
it is meant to help the workers as they adjust to stricter safety protocols put in place at the airport, including segregating them into three zones.
the 14,000 workers have to eat in their own zones.
cag and caas said the fund follows discussions with staff, unions and companies in the airport community.
the enhanced measures were put in place after a covid-19 cluster broke out at terminal 3 last month.
a total of 108 people 43 of whom were airport workers had been infected.
the agencies said 42 airport workers have been discharged, with the remaining worker recovering in hospital without needing additional oxygen.
investigations traced the likely source of infection to staff working in the arrival halls and baggage claim areas, who likely caught the virus from incoming passengers.
these workers likely transmitted the virus to members of the public while eating at the basement 2 foodcourt in t3.
as a result, all areas where some 4,400 workers encounter arriving passengers are regarded as the highest-risk zone the departure and arrival gates, arrival immigration hall and baggage claim hall.
these workers have to take an additional antigen rapid test between their routine polymerase chain reaction tests, and don full personal protective equipment at all times, except during meal times and toilet breaks.
during their shifts, they are not allowed to leave their zone, and will not be cross-deployed to lower-risk zones.
at the t3 foodcourt, which remains closed for now, plexiglass panels have been installed along with tape markings to restrict each table to one diner each.
transport minister s. iswaran yesterday said airport workers remain "very resolute".
"they understand the challenge, the need for many of the adjustments that they have to make.
there is a certain optimism, that we can get through this.
"asked if there could be more financial support for the sector, mr iswaran said the government remains committed to help, but any aid will be based on an assessment of the situation going forward.
responding to queries, cag also said tenants in airport terminals will continue to have their rental fees waived until they are allowed to reopen.
jewel changi airport will open from monday, but the terminals will stay closed to the public for now to give the staff some time to get used to the new measures.
mr iswaran said the change in operations at the airport is a major one.
"when we talk about the changi experience, what it means is travellers from all over the world coming, and in fact, mingling as they experience changi," he added.
"now, we want to segment the passengers.
we are taking a much more calibrated approach.

jewel changi airport will reopen on monday, about a month after it was closed, as no new covid-19 infections linked to a large cluster at terminal 3 (t3) have been detected in the last three weeks.
this comes as other measures in the past month's heightened alert phase will also be eased, as singaporeans gradually return to working and living as before.
"deep cleaning and disinfection of changi airport's passenger terminal buildings and jewel changi airport have been completed," the civil aviation authority of singapore and changi airport group said yesterday.
"(they) are on track to reopen safely and progressively.
"passenger terminal buildings remain closed to the public, however, and jewel's reopening is only the first of a phased process, with airport operations having undergone significant changes, including the segregation of about 14,000 airport workers into different risk zones.
this is to minimise the transmission risks revealed by the t3 cluster, which began at the arrival halls and baggage claim areas, where staff came into contact with passengers.
the cluster spawned 108 cases, 43 of whom were airport workers.
staff working in the highest-risk areas will have to wear personal protective equipment at all times, except when they are eating or resting.
inbound and outbound passengers will also no longer have opportunities to intermingle.
increased testing will become part and parcel of working life for some airport employees.
since may 23, those in higher-risk roles have had to take an additional antigen rapid test between a seven-day routine polymerase chain reaction test.
some are now taking covid-19 breath tests as part of a small-scale pilot, with the airport authorities hoping that routine testing will be quicker and more comfortable for airport workers.
the disposable traciex breathalyser, which has just been approved by the health sciences authority, is non-invasive, has been shown by trials to be almost as accurate as the pcr test, and can generate results within two minutes.
it may eventually replace the antigen rapid tests for workers.
minister for transport s.  iswaran, who visited t3 yesterday, said the breathalyser could be a game changer, but still urged caution.
"we are using this opportunity to administer the trial in the airport, and we will continue to scale it up so that there is more data," he said.
"in the first instance, it is promising, but we need to do a lot of work, and i think the testing will continue and gather pace as we go forward.
"asked about the transport ministry's strategy for reopening borders, mr iswaran said it depends on circumstances here and in the countries singapore is engaging.
in singapore, factors to consider include how extensively and quickly the population is vaccinated, how widely available tests and testing facilities are, and if tracing of new cases remains effective.
the operations at changi airport as a point of entry are also critical, he said, and the airport authorities have fundamentally re-examined operations in the last few weeks.
he said singapore is in conversation with "many potential partners", including south korea, and that both hong kong and singapore remain fully committed to resuming their air travel bubble.
"right now, our engagement with all our partners has been on the various preparatory elements whether vaccination, testing or other kinds of protocols.
when the conditions are right, then we will be able to mobilise," he said.

jewel changi airport reopens to the public on jun 14, but passenger terminals remain closed to allow the airport community to adapt to new zoning measures and safety protocols.
singapore: the civil aviation authority of singapore (caas) and the changi airport group (cag) will set aside s$15 million to help airport workers adjust to enhanced safety measures put in place after more than 100 covid-19 cases were linked to the airport last month.
about 5,000 workers will benefit from the s$15 million, which will be used to provide a monthly special allowance and cater meals for workers for six months, as well as defray the cost of personal protective equipment, they said.
last month changi airport became singapore's largest active covid-19 cluster, with more than 100 cases, with caas and cag saying at the time that preliminary investigations suggested that theinitial transmissioncould have occurred through an airport worker who was "assisting a family from south asia".
subsequently changi airport's passenger terminals, as well as entertainment and retail complex jewel, were closed to the public, while additional covid-19 testing was introduced for arrivals from 'very high-risk' countries and regions.
in a media release on friday (jun 11), caas and cag said there have not been any new covid-19 positive cases involving airport workers since may 20.
"of the 43 airport workers who had tested positive, 42 have been discharged and the remaining worker is recovering in a hospital general ward without oxygen supplementation," they said.
they added that they have been working closely with the health ministry and the airport community to "review and strengthen changi airport's defences against the more transmissible covid-19 variants".
enhanced safety measures have been implemented to protect airport workers, travellers and the public, they said.
"cohorting arrangements for airport workers have been tightened through a zonal system to reduce the risk of cross infection," they said.
"in particular, airport workers in the passenger terminal piers, arrival immigration halls and baggage claim halls who have interactions with arriving and transfer passengers and therefore are at higher risk of exposure to the virus, are now required to remain in their work zone throughout their shift, including during their meal and rest times," they said.
these workers are also required to be in "higher levels" of ppe throughout the duration of their shifts, except for meal and rest times.
deep cleaning and disinfection of changi airport's passenger terminal buildings and jewel changi airport have been completed, while anenhanced segregated zoning systemannounced last month has been implemented, said caas and cag.
"airport workers have been briefed and trained on the new measures and requirements, to allow the new measures and safety protocols to be implemented smoothly," they said, noting there would also be regular reminders, checks and audits on health safety as an "added safeguard".
"the safety of our airport workers remains our top priority.
we are therefore supportive of the tightened measures to ensure they are protected in the course of their work," said national trades union congress deputy secretary-general cham hui fong.
"our unions will continue to work closely with the relevant stakeholders to mitigate any impact on them, and to ensure their wellbeing is taken care of," she added.
jewel to reopen on jun 14jewel, which has been closed to the public since may 13, will reopen on jun 14. changi airport's passenger terminals will remain closed to the public to allow the airport community to adapt to the new zoning measures, which require "significant operational adjustments", said caas and cag.
more details on the reopening of the passenger terminals will be released at a later date, they said.
since may 23, airport workers in higher risk roles have had to take an additional antigen rapid test (art) between their seven-day polymerase chain reaction-based rostered routine tests.
cag and caas said that since jun 3, it has been testing the use of the traciex breathalyser, which allows workers to blow into a disposable breathalyser fitted with a proprietary sensor chip instead of undergoing an art.
traciex was given provisional authorisation by the health sciences authority on may 27.
"the breathalyser will then be inserted into a portable reading device for vibrational spectroscopy analysis, which will be able to tell if a person is infected with covid-19 within two minutes," said cag and caas.
this will allow workers to receive their results faster than with the current art, they said, adding that workers would also experience less discomfort as the test is non-invasive.
"we aim to progressively replace the art for more airport workers with the traciex breathalyser in the coming months.
this will also allow us to step up the frequency of testing so that we can more quickly detect, isolate and treat any potential covid-19 cases in the airport community," they said.
transport minister s iswaran, who visited changi airport on friday, described the new breathalyser test as a "potential game changer" due to its method of administration.
"we will gradually be scaling up the use of this breathalyser to validate its efficacy, and to be able to then scale up its use for a much wider range of workers," he said, noting workers had told him the new test was a welcome alternative to the more invasive pcr and art tests.
reopening travelwhen asked about comments made by south korean authorities that the country planned to expedite travel bubble plans with singapore, mr iswaran said singapore was "engaging in dialogue with many potential partners".
to allow for cross-border travel, key elements such as mutual recognition of vaccinations and testing protocols need to be in place, he said.
meanwhile the enhanced safety measures allow the airport to adapt more quickly to emerging risks, he said, describing these measures as an important part of singapore's "overall posture towards a calibrated and safe reopening of travel".
"once we have those elements in place then, at the appropriate time, when the ambient conditions are there, we can then activate that plan and mobilise the airlines and other partners to facilitate the kind of cross-border travel that we want to achieve.
