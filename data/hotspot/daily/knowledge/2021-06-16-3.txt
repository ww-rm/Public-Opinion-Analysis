singapore more charges, including those involving the immigration and checkpoints authority, are expected to be handed to a woman who was caught on video refusing to wear a mask at marina bay sands (mbs) integrated resort amid the covid-19 outbreak, a district court heard on tuesday (june 15).
the prosecutor mentioned the additional charges on tuesday in asking for a three-week adjournment.
details about these charges were not revealed in court.
phoon chiu yoke, 53, currently faces seven charges over various offences, including failing to wear a mask at public places such as mbs, bras basah complex and outside the state courts building.
the singaporean, who was not represented by a lawyer, told district judge janet wang on tuesday that she wants to apply for these charges to be dropped.
stressing that she is a former naval officer, phoon said that she had been "an eyewitness or plaintiff" in earlier cases linked to the singapore armed forces (saf) and that it would be difficult for her to have a fair hearing due to these cases.
"i am not privy to discuss all these cases in court here without causing embarrassment or being prejudicial to the saf and to the government of singapore.
.
.
(i) am applying for all these charges to be dropped," she said.
"due to all these cases in the past, i should be granted immunity as a citizen.
"judge wang replied that the earlier cases are not relevant to her current set of charges.
[[nid:530394]]at an earlier hearing on may 25, the court ordered that phoon be remanded at the institute of mental health for two weeks for psychiatric assessment.
arguing against the order at the time, phoon also said she was a former naval officer, with a history of good conduct.
she added that she had returned from holiday and was unaware of the laws requiring her to wear a mask.
she first appeared in court last year after she allegedly failed to wear a mask over her nose and mouth "at all times" at newton hawker centre between 7.
20pm and 8pm on may 8 during the circuit breaker period.
she left singapore for britain soon after that alleged offence.
she returned to singapore on june 28 last year and had to serve a 14-day stay-home notice at mbs until july 12. the court earlier heard that she allegedly left her hotel room at mbs between 8.
07pm and 8.
23pm on june 28.
[[nid:532027]]phoon is said to have loitered around various places in the hotel and is accused of failing to wear a mask while doing so.
following this, she allegedly failed to wear a mask in public places on multiple occasions between dec 2 last year and may 24 this year, at mbs and outside the state courts building, as well as at clarke quay central and bras basah complex.
she was arrested on may 25 this year.
on tuesday, her case was adjourned to july 6.  she remains out on bail of $8,000.
first-time offenders who breach laws under the covid-19 (temporary measures) act can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to $10,000.
repeat offenders can be jailed for up to a year and fined up to $20,000.

more than a year into the pandemic, some people in singapore still refuse to abide by covid-19 rules.
on monday (june 14) night, a woman made a scene aboard bus service 69 in bedok as she refused to wear a face mask.
a passenger told shin min daily news that there were about 20 people on the bus at the time.
"i believe that the bus captain didn't notice that she wasn't wearing a mask when she boarded the bus.
"after he alerted him, the bus captain approached the woman to remind her to put a mask on, but she got into an argument with him.
he then called for help from his colleagues at the bedok bus interchange.
according to the chinese daily, a video clip showed the woman taunting the bus captain's colleague, spewing expletives and saying: "call 999, make a police report".
[[nid:502160]]the incident on the bus lasted about 15 minutes, causing many passengers to alight because their journeys were delayed.
moments later, the woman left and the bus captain continued to ply the route.
this is the latest in a string of incidents where passengers got aggressive when they were asked to wear masks on public buses.
several of them threatened and even assaulted bus captains.
since last april, it is a must for commuters to wear a mask when taking public transport and those without one will be denied entry, the land transport authority said.
in may, a 39-year-old man was arrested for causing public nuisance and flouting safe distancing measures as he refused to wear a mask and tried to convince another passenger to take his mask off in a viral video.

shaffiq alkhatibthe straits timesjun 14, 2021a former part-time taxi driver was sentenced on monday (june 14) to 13 months' jail for molesting a female passenger in 2019. in april this year, district judge john ng convicted haji mohamed yusoof a.  p.  m.  adam, now 56, of one count of molestation following a trial.
the 30-year-old victim cannot be named due to a gag order to protect her identity.
lawyer raphael louis, who represents yusoof, earlier told the straits times that his client is a truck driver who was a part-time taxi driver at the time of the offence.
he added that yusoof is no longer holding that part-time job.
during the trial, the court heard that after a drinking session with friends, the woman boarded the taxi on jan 5, 2019, before she fell asleep in the rear seat.
deputy public prosecutor (dpp) benedict chan stated in his submissions that yusoof molested the victim after the taxi arrived at a carpark in lorong ah soo near upper paya lebar road at around 5.
20am.
the dpp added that the woman woke up and shouted at yusoof after feeling his hands on her body.
yusoof then returned to the driver's seat and dropped her off at her intended destination a short distance away, said dpp chan.
the woman later lodged a police report, the court heard.
yusoof claimed that he did not touch the victim, saying he tried to wake her up by calling out to her after the taxi reached the carpark.
he also stated that he later alighted from the vehicle, opened the rear passenger door and called out to her again.
she then woke up, he claimed.
in delivering his verdict in april, judge ng noted that yusoof and the woman had given different accounts of the incident.
there were also no other witnesses present.
the judge found the woman to be a truthful witness and that her evidence was cogent and reliable.
he, however, found that yusoof was evasive.
on monday, the court heard that yusoof intends to appeal against his conviction and sentence.
his bail has been set at $10,000.
offenders convicted of molestation can be jailed for up to two years and fined or caned.
yusoof cannot be caned because he is over 50 years old.

nadine chuathe new paperjun 16, 2021it was his day off and he was resting at home, nursing a fever after getting his second covid-19 vaccine dose a day earlier.
mr muhammad nazlan was watching tv with his wife on sunday night while their three children were out at the playground, located about 50m in front of his housing board unit.
suddenly, his daughter, 10, burst into their first-storey flat, screaming and crying.
mr muhammad, 34, a pest control technician, told the new paper yesterday: "i could not hear what exactly she was saying.
all i knew was something bad had happened to my son.
"i rushed out with my wife and saw my son lying on the ground, his arm stuck to a lamp post.
my son was unconscious but his eyes were still open, and i thought he was gone.
"his eldest son, 14-year-old muhammad rifqy, was playing football with a friend when both teenagers got an electric shock from a lamp post near the fitness corner at block 63 lorong 5 toa payoh.
the singapore civil defence force (scdf) said it received a call for assistance at 8.
25pm and two people were taken to kk women's and children's hospital.
mr muhammad said his son was initially in the intensive care unit but was moved to a regular ward on monday afternoon.
he said rifqy's friend had been discharged.
while his son is conscious, mr muhammad's friend, mr khairul anuar, 36, said rifqy is "not his old self" yet.
"i have been talking to him through video calls.
he is traumatised and his speech is slurred.
sometimes he talks using one word at a time.
but at least he is slowly recovering," said mr khairul, a grabfood rider.
it could have been much worse, if not for mr muhammad's prompt action.
rifqy had lost consciousness from an electric shock after he went to retrieve a ball that had rolled towards the lamp post.
"when i saw him lying there, i quickly tried to pull him away from the lamp post but his arm was stuck to it," said mr muhammad, who is asthmatic.
"that part of his arm looked like it was burned.
my heart felt like something sharp poked it, and i became breathless.
i also felt another two shocks, one in my hand and one in my leg, as i used my hand to pull him away.
"all i could think of was: if he dies, i also die with him.
"mr muhammad said his son seemed as if he had tensed up, and he felt helpless.
"i felt like a useless father because i wanted to give him cpr (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) but people around me were reminding me not to touch him," he said.
the scdf arrived moments later to tend to his son and the friend.
mr muhammad said his son told him the two had got to know each other three days prior to their sunday meeting, and the boy received a jolt when he touched rifqy.
when tnp visited the scene yesterday afternoon, workers were completing the installation of four new lamp posts.
mr muhammad, whose youngest is a five-year-old boy, said staff from bishan-toa payoh town council (btptc), which manages the estate, had contacted him and offered assistance.
town council statementin a statement last night, the town council said it had completed checks to establish the probable cause of the electric shock.
"the btptc licensed electrical worker (lew) noticed a small tear to the insulation of the live wire inside the lamp post.
this would not be visible unless we remove the junction box.
"from the finding, the lew assessed that the exposed part of the wire touching the metal part of the lamp post could be the cause of the electric shock," said the town council.
"the lew has also checked other lamp posts within the same circuitry and found no similar situation.
the incident could be an isolated case as there was also no previous similar incident of such nature.
"the btptc added that works to rectify the issue were completed yesterday and it will "continue to ensure the safety of (the) electrical installations (it manages)".
"i have lived in this flat for 13 years.
my children have been playing at the playground since they were babies.
but now, even with new lamp posts installed, i am not sure if it is safe to let my kids play outside any more," said mr muhammad.
"all i can think of is if my son will recover fully.
i am worried because this is not just a fall or a fracture.
i don't know how he will be affected by this in the long run.

he relentlessly stalked the 24-year-old woman, who was not his girlfriend, from july 2018 to september 2019. on tuesday (june 15), the 26-year-old singaporean was sentenced to 18 months' jail and a fine of $3,000 after pleading guilty to three counts of criminal intimidation.
he also admitted to one count each of assault, harassment and mischief.
the woman cannot be named due to a gag order to protect her identity.
heng got to know her in 2016 and they grew close.
but she decided to end their friendship in december 2017 because she felt he was "very possessive".
despite this, he frequently demanded to meet her and used vulgarities as well as threats when she refused.
the woman started ignoring his text messages and calls from july 27, 2018, but this did little to stop his attempts to contact her.
in just a few days, she received more than 100 missed calls from him.
on july 29, he sent her a text message, threatening to burn down her home and slash her mother if she refused to see him later that day.
the victim later blocked his mobile phone number on whatsapp and telegram.
in august, she moved out and sought shelter at a relative's home until january 2019. undeterred, heng continued trying to contact the woman by using another phone number.
he sent her multiple threatening messages from august 2018 to july 2019, including a message on july 25, in which he threatened to kill her, her mother and her boyfriend.
heng was arrested and charged in court two days later after the woman alerted the police.
he was ordered to stop contacting her as part of his bail conditions.
two months later, while out on bail, he breached the conditions by continuing to text her.
separately, heng threatened to burn down his grandmother's home in october 2019 after a dispute, despite the 73-year-old woman acting as his bailor.
she discharged herself from the responsibility soon after.
in an unrelated case, heng assaulted a valet driver in july 2019.  he also kicked and dented another man's car in 2020. in mitigation, heng's lawyers, mr josephus tan and mr cory wong from invictus law corporation, said their client has a history of conditions, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and is remorseful.
heng is now out on bail of $15,000 and must surrender himself at the state courts on july 13 to begin serving his jail term.

source: alex tohsw / facebooka singaporean man, who goes by the moniker alex tohsw, encountered "a horrifying experience" on sunday (13 june) when his neighbour allegedly attacked him from behind with a bicycle chain attached to a lock pad, while he was cleaning the window panel outside his house.
he first posted about the incident on the complaint singapore facebook group, which has now garnered about 1.
9k shares and 1.
4k likes.
mr alex wrote that he was cleaning the window panel outside his house while standing on a metal ladder, when his neighbour suddenly attacked him from behind with a bicycle chain, which was attached to a lock pad.
"he claimed that i was blocking his path to go back home just because i placed his bicycle by the walkway," he noted.
mr alex also alleged that the neighbour hit him twice on the head and shoulder with the bicycle chain.
"i shouted for help as my head was bleeding profusely and i was in severe pain.
my 2 kids were in the living room and were startled to see me covered in blood," he added.
mr alex noted that his other neighbour intervened and quickly stopped the assailant from attacking him.
"my helpful neighbour lay me down as i was feeling unconscious but i was very worried for the safety of my 2 kids as the main door was unlocked.
thankfully my helpful neighbour was keeping an eye on the assailant," he noted.
following the incident, the police told mothership that a 65-year-old man has been arrested for "voluntarily causing hurt with a dangerous weapon" and it is currently under police investigation.
the police said it was alerted about the incident at 10.
26am on saturday at block 130 ang mo kio avenue 3.
"a 47-year-old man had sustained a laceration on his head, and was conscious when conveyed to the hospital," it noted.
while many netizens expressed their wishes for mr alex's speedy recovery under the comment section of his post, several facebook users seem to question the assailant's side of the story and what triggered him to assault mr alex in the first place.
however, many netizens pointed out that the neighbour should not use violence against mr alex nonetheless, as causing injury to others is wrong unless if it was for self-defence.

singapore: an 85-year-old man was fined s$5,000 and banned from driving for a year on monday (jun 14) for colliding with a motorcyclist, leaving him with a fractured leg and dislocated toe.
khoo tea wah, who appeared in court with a walking stick, pleaded guilty to one count of causing grievous hurt by a negligent act.
he admitted to failing to give way to the 29-year-old motorcyclist while he was driving his car out from a car park at block 40, bedok south road.
the incident happened at about 11.
30am on sep 25, 2019. the court heard that khoo's wife was in the front passenger seat as he exited the car park gantry and stopped to check for oncoming vehicles.
he wanted to make a right turn into bedok south road towards bedok south avenue 1.  khoo saw the victim's motorcycle approaching in the first lane, furthest away from him, but still proceeded to make the turn even though the victim had the right of way.
khoo drove across the third and second lanes of the road.
just as he was about to enter the motorcyclist's lane, his wife said "motorbike, motorbike", asking him to stop.
however, khoo continued to drive forward and stopped only after his wife said "motorbike" a third time.
it was too late at this point and his vehicle collided into the motorcyclist.

he was taken to hospital with injuries including a knee wound, a fractured femur and a dislocated toe.
he was warded for 25 days, given more than a year's hospitalisation leave and underwent multiple surgical procedures for his wrist and thigh.

however, she noted khoo's lack of prior convictions, his plea of guilt and his advanced age.
he had also stopped to help the victim, she said.
in mitigation, khoo pleaded for leniency.
"i have been driving for a long time and have always maintained a clean driving record," he said through an interpreter.
"i know i did wrong, and i plead guilty.
please impose a light sentence on account that i'm already advanced in age.

singapore a former part-time taxi driver was sentenced on monday (june 14) to 13 months' jail for molesting a female passenger in 2019. in april this year, district judge john ng convicted haji mohamed yusoof a.  p.  m.  adam, now 56, of one count of molestation following a trial.
the 30-year-old victim cannot be named due to a gag order to protect her identity.
lawyer raphael louis, who represents yusoof, earlier told the straits times that his client is a truck driver who was a part-time taxi driver at the time of the offence.
he added that yusoof is no longer holding that part-time job.
during the trial, the court heard that after a drinking session with friends, the woman boarded the taxi on jan 5, 2019, before she fell asleep in the rear seat.
deputy public prosecutor (dpp) benedict chan stated in his submissions that yusoof molested the victim after the taxi arrived at a carpark in lorong ah soo near upper paya lebar road at around 5.
20am.
the dpp added that the woman woke up and shouted at yusoof after feeling his hands on her body.
yusoof then returned to the driver's seat and dropped her off at her intended destination a short distance away, said dpp chan.
the woman later lodged a police report, the court heard.
yusoof claimed that he did not touch the victim, saying he tried to wake her up by calling out to her after the taxi reached the carpark.
he also stated that he later alighted from the vehicle, opened the rear passenger door and called out to her again.
she then woke up, he claimed.
in delivering his verdict in april, judge ng noted that yusoof and the woman had given different accounts of the incident.
there were also no other witnesses present.
the judge found the woman to be a truthful witness and that her evidence was cogent and reliable.
he, however, found that yusoof was evasive.
on monday, the court heard that yusoof intends to appeal against his conviction and sentence.
his bail has been set at $10,000.
offenders convicted of molestation can be jailed for up to two years and fined or caned.
yusoof cannot be caned because he is over 50 years old.

singapore: a man was jailed for 10 months on monday (jun 14) for paying for a sex act with a 17-year-old boy, after tricking the boy into believing he was a "sugar mummy".
muhammad al-masfuiin mushin, 26, pleaded guilty to one charge of commercial sex with a minor.
the court heard that the victim began using an application called locanto in 2017.  he discovered that there were advertisements for sexual services, and users looking for "sugar mummies" or "friends with benefits".
"sugar mummy" is a term for older women who pay younger individuals for companionship that may be of a sexual nature.
the victim wanted to earn money by offering sexual services and created an account.
on jun 16, 2019, the victim was kicked out of his house after a heated argument with his mother.
as he needed money, he put up an ad seeking a sugar mummy, titling it "toyboy fantasy satisfies you 18".
he included his phone number and two photos of himself in the ad, offering sexual services in exchange for money.
the accused saw the ad a day later.
even though the victim was searching for a sugar mummy, muhammad al-masfuiin decided to pose as a woman and chat with the victim.
he began chatting with the boy on telegram, saying: "i'm looking for a young boy to be my sex slave.
"he asked the victim for photos and body statistics of himself, and told him he was female.
when muhammad al-masfuiin asked the victim for his real age, the victim replied that he was 17, had been chased out of his house and needed money.
posing as a woman, muhammad al-masfuiin asked the victim "would you have sex with my (boyfriend) and i", despite knowing there would be no woman involved.
the victim agreed and asked for s$250 per meet-up.

at 1am on jun 18, 2019, muhammad al-masfuiin booked a taxi for the victim to go to muhammad al-masfuiin's house.
believing that the buyer was a woman, the victim asked if "she" would be joining the sex session.
muhammad al-masfuiin replied that she "might not", but the boyfriend "will tell me if you did a great job at sex".
the victim asked muhammad al-masfuiin if he knew the victim was 17, and muhammad al-masfuiin replied "yes", adding: "i like my boys young".
the victim got to muhammad al-masfuiin's home.
he took a shower on muhammad al-masfuiin's instruction and came out of the bathroom to see muhammad al-masfuiin performing a sex act.
muhammad al-masfuiin then performed a sex act on the victim before asking him for sex.
the victim resisted, but muhammad al-masfuiin was of a bigger build than him.
before muhammad al-masfuiin could initiate sex, he ejaculated.
the victim got dressed and went to sleep and texted the accused's number, thinking it belonged to a woman, telling "her" that the sex session was completed.
the next morning, the victim woke up and asked muhammad al-masfuiin for money to get to work.
muhammad al-masfuiin gave him s$50 and the victim left.
later that day, a police officer on foot patrol in toa payoh came across the victim.
in the course of investigations, he found messages in the victim's phone pertaining to the provision of sexual services.
court documents did not specify why the victim was stopped by police.

                singapore (the straits times/ann): a man posed as a woman online to lure a 17-year-old boy into having commercial sex with him.
muhammad al-masfuiin muhsin, now 26, had pretended to be a woman who was looking for a "sex slave" to provide sexual services for "herself" and her "boyfriend" in exchange for s$250.
on june 18, 2019, the teenager, who had been kicked out of his home earlier, arrived at a tampines flat.
al-masfuiin, posing as the boyfriend, then performed a sexual act on the boy in exchange for a night's lodging in the unit.
he also gave the boy a $50 note.
the singaporean, who was aware of the teenager's age, was sentenced on monday (june 14) to 10 months' jail after admitting that he had indulged in commercial sex with a minor below 18 years old.
the victim cannot be named due to a gag order to protect his identity.
deputy public prosecutor emily koh said that some time in 2017, the boy started using online classifieds website locanto and discovered advertisements for sexual services as well as posts by people looking for "sugar mummies" or "friends with benefits".
a sugar mummy commonly refers to an older woman who is willing to pay for the company of a younger person.
he created an account on locanto as he wanted to earn money by offering sexual services.
the teenager was kicked out of his home on june 16, 2019, after a heated argument with his mother.
in need of money, he created an advertisement on locanto titled "toyboy fantasy", stating he was looking for a "sugar mummy" and was willing to provide sexual services.
al-masfuiin, who came across the advertisement, posed as a woman and chatted with the boy via messaging platform telegram.
the dpp said: "the accused was aware that the victim had no place to stay and offered lodging to the victim.
still posing as a female, the accused told the victim that he could stay at 'her boyfriend's place' and that 'he'll send a grab to let you stay over'.
"believing that the accused was a female, the victim asked if the accused was joining the sex session.
the accused, still posing as a female, replied that 'she' 'might not', 'but my (boyfriend) will tell me if you did a great job at sex'.
"the teenager arrived at the tampines flat at around 1.
20am on june 18 and al-masfuiin performed oral sex on him.
the boy later fell asleep in the unit and al-masfuiin gave him the $50 note after he woke up that morning.
the pair then parted ways.

a graphic designer was allegedly attacked by his neighbour with a bicycle chain in the corridor of his housing board flat on saturday.
he suffered a cut to his head that needed stitches.
the victim, who wanted to be known only as mr toh, told chinese-language evening daily lianhe wanbao that the alleged attack occurred after he had moved his neighbour's bicycle.
the police told the new paper they were alerted to the case of dispute that happened at block 130 ang mo kio avenue 3 at about 10.
30am.
they arrested a 65-year-old man for voluntarily causing hurt with a dangerous weapon.
investigations are ongoing.
speaking to wanbao, mr toh, 47, claimed that he had moved his neighbour's bicycle that was parked next to his window so that he could climb his ladder and clean the outside of the window.
when the neighbour returned and saw that his bicycle had been moved, he allegedly pushed the bicycle with force, causing it to hit the ladder.
shocked, mr toh turned around to ask his neighbour what was wrong.
mr toh told wanbao: "without a word, he took out a chain with a lock from the bicycle basket and started attacking me.
"the alleged attack caused mr toh to fall off the ladder and he felt severe pain on the back of his head.
he ran to a nearby unit to ask for help from a woman.
she took a towel to stem the bleeding and mr toh claimed she also stepped forward to stop the neighbour from attacking him again.
mr toh, who was in a daze, said he was concerned for the safety of his children who were in the house.
the divorcee's 14-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son were visiting him as it was the school holidays.
he said: "i was dizzy from being beaten up, but i remembered that my front door was unlocked.
"i was worried that the attacker would run into the house and hurt my children.
"fortunately, the woman living next door helped attend to my children.
"mr toh was taken to khoo teck puat hospital by the singapore civil defence force.
wanbao reported that he needed five stitches for a 4cm wound on his head.
he was discharged on the same day.
mr toh has been living with three tenants in the unit for about two years.
he alleged that the neighbour has been spitting and throwing garbage outside his unit and that the incidents started a month after he had moved in in 2019. mr toh said: "my injury is of secondary concern.
i am more worried about how this incident will affect my children.

singapore a man posed as a woman online to lure a 17-year-old boy into having commercial sex with him.
muhammad al-masfuiin muhsin, now 26, had pretended to be a woman who was looking for a "sex slave" to provide sexual services for "herself" and her "boyfriend" in exchange for $250.
on june 18, 2019, the teenager, who had been kicked out of his home earlier, arrived at a tampines flat.
al-masfuiin, posing as the boyfriend, then performed a sexual act on the boy in exchange for a night's lodging in the unit.
he also gave the boy a $50 note.
the singaporean, who was aware of the teenager's age, was sentenced on monday (june 14) to 10 months' jail after admitting that he had indulged in commercial sex with a minor below 18 years old.
the victim cannot be named due to a gag order to protect his identity.
deputy public prosecutor emily koh said that some time in 2017, the boy started using online classifieds website locanto and discovered advertisements for sexual services as well as posts by people looking for "sugar mummies" or "friends with benefits".
a sugar mummy commonly refers to an older woman who is willing to pay for the company of a younger person.
he created an account on locanto as he wanted to earn money by offering sexual services.
the teenager was kicked out of his home on june 16, 2019, after a heated argument with his mother.
in need of money, he created an advertisement on locanto titled "toyboy fantasy", stating he was looking for a "sugar mummy" and was willing to provide sexual services.
al-masfuiin, who came across the advertisement, posed as a woman and chatted with the boy via messaging platform telegram.
the dpp said: "the accused was aware that the victim had no place to stay and offered lodging to the victim.
still posing as a female, the accused told the victim that he could stay at 'her boyfriend's place' and that 'he'll send a grab to let you stay over'.
"believing that the accused was a female, the victim asked if the accused was joining the sex session.
the accused, still posing as a female, replied that 'she' 'might not', 'but my (boyfriend) will tell me if you did a great job at sex'.
"the teenager arrived at the tampines flat at around 1.
20am on june 18 and al-masfuiin performed oral sex on him.
the boy later fell asleep in the unit and al-masfuiin gave him the $50 note after he woke up that morning.
the pair then parted ways.
a police officer was patrolling in toa payoh later that day when he spotted the teenager.
he looked through the youngster's mobile phone and found out the minor had been providing sexual services.
al-masfuiin was arrested soon after.
for having commercial sex with a minor below 18 years old, an offender can be jailed for up to seven years and fined.

houston — houston police are investigating after a new rolls-royce was found shot up and left with doors wide open on the side of the east freeway sunday morning.
this strange scene unfolded at about 2:15 a. m.  on the westbound lanes of the freeway near san jacinto.
officers were the ones who found the high-end car parked along the side of the freeway, according to investigators.
when the officers approached the car, they saw it had front-end damage.
they also found multiple bullet holes along the side of it.
all of the doors of the rolls-royce were also left open, but no one was inside.
the car was towed off the freeway and that's when investigators said they found blood inside the car, and they also found shell casings, indicating that shots were fired from the vehicle and that it may have been involved in some sort of shootout.
moments later, investigators were notified that two people who may have been inside the rolls-royce showed up to the hospital with injuries from cut glass and the airbags exploding.
police said these two people are not being cooperative with the investigation so, at this time, they have no idea what actually led to this incident and if there is anyone else involved.
the houston police department is asking anyone who may have any information on this scene, to please call the major assaults division or crime stoppers at 713-222-8477.  also popular on khou.

hong kong: hong kong police arrested at least three protesters on saturday (jun 12), the anniversary of protests in 2019 that rocked the financial hub and eventually led to beijing introducing a security law that critics say has stifled dissent.
the protesters were arrested for disorderly conduct and failing to produce proof of identity, while at least 10 people were summoned for violating a ban on gatherings, police said, after protests in the kowloon district of mongkok.
some people blocked roads by placing rubbish bins and other objects on them, police said.
"the police strongly condemn .
.
.
acts endangering public health and safety," police said in a post on facebook shortly before midnight on saturday.
the three people arrested were teenagers, aged 15 to 19, police said.
small groups gathered on saturday to commemorate the first major clashes between protesters and police two years ago when tens of thousands demonstrated against a proposed law for the former british colony that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to the mainland for trial.
many hong kong residents saw the proposed law as further erosion of the city's special status that was supposed to be guaranteed under a "one country, two systems" formula agreed when britain handed it over to china in 1997. the 2019 protests snowballed over subsequent months into a mass movement for democracy that included regular clashes between protesters and police firing tear gas and rubber bullets.
police deployed 2,000 officers around the city on saturday, the south china morning post reported.
police said on the eve of the anniversary that they had arrested two people on suspicion of promoting and inciting others to join an unlawful assembly.
activist group student politicism said two of its leaders were arrested.
there was no sign of any protests on sunday.

singapore: a 46-year-old man who had spent more than 20 years on the run for immigration offences he committed has been arrested, said the corrupt practices investigation bureau (cpib) on friday (jun 11).
siva kumar ramachandram, who is malaysian, was arrested by the cpib with the help of the malaysian anti-corruption commission (macc) on mar 4 last year.
on sep 24, 1999, siva was convicted and sentenced to five years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane for engaging in a conspiracy to smuggle illegal immigrants from singapore into malaysia through woodlands checkpoint.
the conspiracy involved bribing a cisco officer to allow buses ferrying the illegal immigrants to pass through the checkpoint without immigration clearance.
the cisco officer was convicted on oct 5, 1999 and was sentenced to 12 months' jail and fined s$2,800 for corruption.
siva later absconded from singapore sometime in 1999, while released on bail pending appeal of his conviction and sentence.
an arrest warrant for him was issued on mar 9, 2000, the date of his appeal hearing, which he failed to turn up for.
cipb investigations revealed that in october 1999, siva left singapore for malaysia in the vehicle of an unknown individual known as "boy".
"boy" had produced a passport belonging to someone else to the immigration officer at woodlands checkpoint.
this led the immigration officer into believing siva was someone else, thus allowing him to leave singapore, said the authorities.
he was arrested on mar 4, 2020 and brought back to singapore.
siva was charged on apr 16 this year with offences punishable under the immigration act and the penal code.
on friday, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six months' jail with effect from the expiry of his existing five-year sentence meted out in 1999, said the bureau.
"the invaluable assistance and strong support by the macc has resulted in siva's arrest on mar 4, 2020.
"cpib is grateful for the close collaboration with the macc on this case to ensure that the offender was brought to justice and there was no escaping the long arm of the law," it said.
the bureau said singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption and other criminal activities.
"cpib's mandate is to investigate into any act of corruption in the public and private sectors in singapore, and in the course of doing so, any other offences under any written law," it said.
anyone who is convicted of knowingly producing any false or misleading document under the immigration act can be sentenced to jail for up to two years and be fined up to s$6,000.
anyone who is convicted of failing to appear before a court of justice under the penal code can be sentenced to jail for up to six months and be fined up to s$5,000.

singapore: two men will be charged in court on friday (jun 11) for their suspected involvement in a series of china officials impersonation scams.
the men, aged 46 and 48, are accused of collecting money from victims of the scam and are believed to have received commission for their involvement, said the singapore police force (spf) on thursday.
the police said they received reports from five victims between jul 18 and 29 last year.
"phone scammers claiming to be from the 'chinese police' had accused the victims of being involved in transnational money-laundering crimes," said spf.
"the victims were believed to have been subsequently misled into handing cash totalling s$1,580,000 to various persons in singapore to prove that their money was not derived from illegal activities.
"police investigations revealed that the two men became involved in the scam after responding to a job listing on facebook which promised s$300 for courier work.
"after being added to a whatsapp chat group and following the instructions by the group's organisers, the duo allegedly began collecting money amounting to s$230,000 from three out of the five victims," spf said.
"the collections were then purportedly handed over to unknown persons.
"both men allegedly received a total of s$15,700 as commission but they have since surrendered the amount during investigations, said the police.
they will be charged for assisting another to retain benefits from criminal conduct under the corruption, drug trafficking and other serious offences (confiscation of benefits) act.
if convicted, they face up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to s$500,000, or both.
the police advised members of the public to ignore unsolicited calls asking for money to be handed over in relation to supposed criminal investigations.
they also warned against giving out personal information and bank details.
"no local government agency will demand payment through a phone call or other social messaging platforms, demand that you hand over cash to strangers or ask you for your personal banking information such as your internet banking passwords," spf said.
"for foreign residents receiving calls from persons claiming to be police officers or government officials from your home country, please call your embassy/high commission to verify the claims of the caller.
"the police also warned members of the public not to collect money from other individuals on behalf of strangers, especially if they claim to be law enforcement officers.

singapore a man who was on the run from the law for 20 years was sentenced on friday (june 11) to an additional six months in jail for misleading an immigration officer and for missing a court hearing in 2000. siva kumar ramachandram, 46, fled to malaysia after being convicted here of smuggling illegal immigrants out through the woodlands checkpoint, the corrupt practices investigation bureau (cpib) said on friday.
he had been sentenced to five years in jail and 12 strokes of the cane on sept 24, 1999. but siva fled the country sometime in october 1999, with the help of a friend known only as "boy".
at the woodlands checkpoint, siva, a malaysian, used an unidentified person's passport to cross into malaysia.
he was on court bail at the time, and missed his magistrate's appeal hearing on march 9, 2000, at the high court of singapore.
a warrant for his arrest was issued that day, said cpib.
he was arrested by the cpib on march 4, 2020, with the help of the malaysian anti-corruption commission.
on april 16, 2021, siva was charged with offences under the immigration act and penal code.
he will serve the six-month jail term after completing his initial five-year sentence.
siva was given the five-year sentence after he was found guilty of a conspiracy that involved bribing a cisco officer to allow buses to transport illegal immigrants from singapore into malaysia through the woodlands checkpoint.
the cisco officer was sentenced to one year in jail and fined $2,800 in 1999. cpib said that singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach to corruption.

singapore: a 46-year-old man who had spent more than 20 years on the run for immigration offences he committed has been arrested, said the corrupt practices investigation bureau (cpib) on friday (jun 11).
siva kumar ramachandram, who is malaysian, was arrested by the cpib with the help of the malaysian anti-corruption commission (macc) on mar 4 last year.
on sep 24, 1999, siva was convicted and sentenced to five years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane for engaging in a conspiracy to smuggle illegal immigrants from singapore into malaysia through woodlands checkpoint.
the conspiracy involved bribing a cisco officer to allow buses ferrying the illegal immigrants to pass through the checkpoint without immigration clearance.
the cisco officer was convicted on oct 5, 1999 and was sentenced to 12 months' jail and fined s$2,800 for corruption.
siva later absconded from singapore sometime in 1999, while released on bail pending appeal of his conviction and sentence.
an arrest warrant for him was issued on mar 9, 2000, the date of his appeal hearing, which he failed to turn up for.
cipb investigations revealed that in october 1999, siva left singapore for malaysia in the vehicle of an unknown individual known as "boy".
"boy" had produced a passport belonging to someone else to the immigration officer at woodlands checkpoint.
this led the immigration officer into believing siva was someone else, thus allowing him to leave singapore, said the authorities.
he was arrested on mar 4, 2020 and brought back to singapore.
siva was charged on apr 16 this year with offences punishable under the immigration act and the penal code.
on friday, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six months' jail with effect from the expiry of his existing five-year sentence meted out in 1999, said the bureau.
"the invaluable assistance and strong support by the macc has resulted in siva's arrest on mar 4, 2020.
"cpib is grateful for the close collaboration with the macc on this case to ensure that the offender was brought to justice and there was no escaping the long arm of the law," it said.
the bureau said singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption and other criminal activities.
"cpib's mandate is to investigate into any act of corruption in the public and private sectors in singapore, and in the course of doing so, any other offences under any written law," it said.
anyone who is convicted of knowingly producing any false or misleading document under the immigration act can be sentenced to jail for up to two years and be fined up to s$6,000.
anyone who is convicted of failing to appear before a court of justice under the penal code can be sentenced to jail for up to six months and be fined up to s$5,000.

singapore two men will be charged in court on friday (june 11) for their alleged roles in a series of scams that cheated their victims of almost $1.
6 million.
the scams involved people calling and posing as police officers from china, said the singapore police force on thursday.
between july 18 and july 29, 2020, the commercial affairs department received reports from five victims who had fallen prey to scammers pretending to be chinese officials.
phone scammers claiming to be the chinese police had accused the victims of being involved in transnational money-laundering crimes.
the victims were believed to have been subsequently misled into handing over cash totalling $1,580,000 to various people in singapore to prove that their money was not derived from illegal activities.
the men, aged 46 and 48, are alleged to have been involved in the ruse as couriers, and received a combined $15,700 as commission.
they are suspected of collecting $230,000 from three victims, which they handed over to unidentified people.
the men got involved after responding to a job listing on facebook promising $300 for courier work.
they were then added into a whatsapp chat where they received instructions to collect money from the victims.
they surrendered their commission money over to the police during investigations.
the pair were caught after the police received reports from the victims.
the duo will be charged with assisting another to retain benefits from criminal conduct, which carries a penalty of 10 years in jail and/or a fine of up to $500,000.
the police advise members of the public to take the following precautions when they receive unsolicited calls asking them to part with their money:1.  ignore the calls and the caller's instructions.
2.  understand that no local government agency will demand payment through a phone call or social messaging platforms, or demand that they hand over cash to strangers, or ask for personal banking information.
3.  if they are not singaporean, check with their embassy or high commission to verify the call.
4.  call a friend or relative before making any decisions.
"do not be pressured by the caller to act impulsively," added the police.
the police also said that the public should not collect money for strangers, especially if they are claiming to be law enforcement officers.
"such callers are likely to be scammers, and the members of the public who act on their instructions may unwittingly have committed a crime by assisting to launder money from criminal activities," they added.
if they have information related to these scams, or if they have any doubts, the public can call 1800-255-0000 or submit it online at www.

lee joonmin was riding along woodlands road on monday evening (june 7) when he saw the flash of a blue and red light in his motorcycle's rearview mirror.
when he realised a traffic police officer was tailing him, the 23-year-old dispatch supervisor broke into a sweat.
"to my horror, i saw the [traffic police] officer was gesturing at me to pull over," lee said in a facebook post later that evening.
it soon went viral with over 1,200 shares.
he was stunned when the officer revealed why he was getting "booked".
[embed]https://www.
facebook.
com/chifferon/posts/4324023350982616[/embed]speaking with asiaone, lee said many thoughts raced through his mind as he dismounted his motorcycle, including "oh no, what did i do", "there goes my money", "did i fail to signal?
"he recounted how there was a "super awkward and longest sentence pause of [his] entire life" before the officer told him what he was actually pulled over for.
lee was given a reward for being a safety role model to other motorcyclists on the road, as he was wearing protective riding gear.
only then did lee breathe a sigh of relief and graciously accepted the reward — a bag filled with a mask, hand sanitiser, surface sanitiser, wet tissues, an ez-link card and a pouch.
"i never expected this to happen to me," he said.
"[the officer] really had me there.
"lee isn't the only person to have been pulled over by the traffic police for being a good noodle.
since the introduction of the "reward the riders" initiative in 2019, the traffic police have been recognising and rewarding numerous motorcyclists who wear protective gear and display good riding behaviour on the road.
[embed]https://twitter.
com/singaporepolice/status/1177967230400659456[/embed]despite the heat, the expensive riding gear and the social stigma that comes with wearing the full outfit, lee said he chose to wear the protective wear as he knew the pain that came with traffic accidents.
"i crashed three whole times within my first month of riding," he sheepishly admitted.
"never again after that!"rainercheung@asiaone.

singapore a cyclist who punched a lorry driver in a road rage incident was fined $5,600 on thursday (june 10).
jeffery todd martin, 57, a canadian and a singapore permanent resident, pleaded guilty to one count each of voluntarily causing hurt and riding his bicycle without due regard for the safety of others.
at about 10.
20am on feb 24, 2019, martin was cycling in jalan eunos when a lorry overtook him.
he later overtook the lorry, pointing at the driver as he did so, and stopped in the middle of the lane in front of the vehicle.
this caused the lorry to stop amid moving traffic.
martin got off his bike and hit the driver's window, hurling vulgarities at the driver as he did so.
the lorry driver, chinese national zhang ping, 33, then moved his vehicle sharply towards martin, forcing him to step away.
zhang alighted from the lorry, holding an orange flask as he approached martin.
once confronted, martin punched him in the face, causing zhang to fall.
martin later cycled away as zhang remained in a daze sitting on the road.
zhang suffered cuts on his lips as a result of the punch, and was given medical leave for two days.
he was previously dealt with, and was jailed for a week for one count of a rash act endangering others.
a 30-second video of the incident had gone viral after the incident in 2019, and zhang had been arrested within 48 hours.
the same video was played in court on thursday.
after playing the video for the court, deputy public prosecutor emily koh said the prosecution would not be pushing for a custodial sentence, as the attack was one of low harm and culpability.
district judge brenda tan noted that prior to the punch, it was zhang who had come out from the vehicle to confront martin.
she said that while the custodial threshold had not been crossed, a high fine was warranted.
for voluntarily causing hurt, martin could have been jailed for up to two years on top of the maximum $5,000 fine he received for the charge.
for not riding his bicycle in an orderly manner with due regard for the safety of others, he could have been jailed for up to three months and fined up to $1,000.

he pleaded guilty to the two charges on thursday (june 10) and was ordered to compensate the victim.
guimaraes is a fifa licensed players' agent who scouted for talent here and in the region to play in european football clubs.
he came to singapore in 2004 and founded the football management international company in 2010. on july 11 last year, at about 1pm, he went to pick his seven-year-old daughter from oasis primary school in punggol.
he drove along edgefield plains, the road just outside the school, intending to wait with other cars along the road for his daughter.

as the victim was alighting from his car, guimaraes pushed the car door, causing it to hit the victim's shin.
he also grabbed the victim's wrist and they began arguing.
when the victim got out of his car, guimaraes pushed him.
the court heard that guimaraes hurled vulgarities at the victim throughout the encounter and put on a mask only when the victim started taking a video with his phone.
guimaraes also slapped the victim at the side of his head and kicked him before the police arrived.
on thursday, the court was told that guimaraes was deeply ashamed of his conduct and was pleading for leniency.
for voluntarily causing hurt, he could have been jailed for up to two years, or fined up to $5,000, or both.
for not wearing a mask without a reasonable excuse, he could have been jailed for up to six months, or fined up to $10,000, or both.

the three men and a woman, aged between 25 and 54, allegedly committed the offences in three separate incidents, said a police statement on friday (june 11).
one of them, ng chwee hock, was charged on friday for using insulting words against a public servant at redhill food centre on thursday.
the 46-year-old's case will be heard again on july 9.
"preliminary investigations revealed that (ng) allegedly used abusive language towards the sdeo, when he was advised not to sit at the table in the food centre to consume his food and drinks," police said.
sdeo refers to a safe distancing enforcement officer.
ng purportedly refused to comply even when police officers advised him to do so, and continued to verbally abuse the sdeo.
police told the straits times that he is currently under investigation for other unrelated offences.
in another incident on may 26, police received a report from an sda that a man taunted her while she was on duty in crawford lane.
he allegedly approached the sda, pulled down his mask and asked her to catch him.
another woman is said to have then approached the sda, pushed her on her shoulder and stepped on her foot.
both the man and woman then fled the scene.
police said the identities of the man, who is 54, and the woman, who is 25, were established through investigations.
they are assisting with investigations for using criminal force, voluntarily causing hurt and flouting safe distancing measures.
the third incident occurred on may 27 when police were alerted to a dispute involving a group of men at a void deck in yishun street 11. officers spotted the men allegedly gathering, with beer cans strewn across a table beside them.
a 39-year-old, who wanted to leave as officers were interviewing the group, allegedly became rowdy and hurled vulgarities after he was told to stay put.
he purportedly punched another man in the group when the latter tried to calm him down.
he was arrested for using abusive language against a public servant and causing annoyance while drunk.
the group will also be investigated for breaching safe distancing measures.
individuals found guilty of using abusive words against a public servant can be jailed for up to a year, or fined up to $5,000, or both.
for breaching safe distancing measures, a first-time offender may be jailed up to six months, or fined up to $10,000, or both.
those convicted of using criminal force can be jailed up to three months, or fined up to $1,500, or both.
for voluntarily causing hurt, an offender may be jailed up to three years, or fined up to $5,000, or both.
the offence of causing annoyance while drunk carries a maximum punishment of six months' jail and a fine of $1,000.

singapore: a man was jailed two weeks on friday (jun 11) for assaulting his wife after she rejected his request for a sexual favour.
calvin kok chong meng, 32, pleaded guilty to one charge of committing family violence against his wife when she had a personal protection order against him.

the court heard that the victim had obtained a personal protection order against kok on jan 18, 2017 after he hit her.
on mar 17, 2021, kok had a couple of alcoholic drinks after returning home from work at around 11.
30pm.
at about midnight, he went into the room where his wife was sleeping and asked her for a sexual favour.
when his wife rejected him, he got upset and began hitting her, according to court documents.
the victim was underneath the blanket on the bed when kok began slapping her several times on her thighs and arms.
that same day, the victim sought medical attention for her multiple bruises, which included bruising over her head, face, neck, arms and thighs.
she also lodged a police report.
the prosecutor asked for two weeks' jail, noting that kok's wife has since forgiven him and they are going for matrimonial counselling.
kok, who did not have a lawyer, requested for a lighter sentence with no jail, saying he would lose his job if he was imprisoned.
he said he needed the job to support his family, including his daughter and grandmother.
he asked for a chance to turn over a new leaf and said his wife was in court to mitigate for him if need be.
the judge responded: "yes, but she was not willing to be intimate and you were violent towards her.
"she added that the high court has indicated that jail terms must be imposed for cases like kok's.
kok replied that he understood and promised not to reoffend in the future.
for breaching a protection order, he could have been jailed up to six months, fined up to s$2,000, or both.
