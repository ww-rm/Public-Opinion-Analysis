Tennis: I'll remember this forever, says Djokovic after toppling Nadal in Paris.
paris: after dethroning 'king of clay' rafa nadal at the french open, novak djokovic will next face a first-time grand slam finalist in stefanos tsitsipas as the world number one bids to become the first man in the open era to win all four majors at least twice.
roy emerson and rod laver are the only men to have won each of the four grand slams on two or more occasions but no one has achieved the feat since 1968, when the sport allowed professional players to compete at the majors.
a second trophy at roland garros, after his 2016 triumph on the red clay, on sunday will also give the 34-year-old serbian his 19th grand slam title one short of nadal and roger federer's men's record.
his challenger will be a 22-year-old who is bidding to become the first greek to win a singles major.
tsitsipas has long been marked out as a future grand slam champion and has already collected trophies from the season-ending atp finals and a masters 1000 tournament.
but he had drawn a blank the three times he reached the last-four stage at a major before friday's semi-final where he took down u. s.  open finalist alexander zverev in a thrilling five-set duel.
the first grand slam finalist from greece will arrive on court philippe chatrier on sunday with a 2-5 win-loss record against the serbian but will draw inspiration from the fact that he has a tour-leading win tally in 2021.
"i'm looking forward to that challenge," tsitsipas said on friday, looking ahead to his first major final.
"i'm looking forward to bring my game to kind of challenge myself to step it up.
"nothing less than his 'a' game would suffice for the greek as he has never managed to defeat djokovic on clay though he took the serbian to five sets in the semi-finals at the same venue last year.
the emotions of friday's fantastic win over 13-time french open winner nadal might leave a hangover for most players but that might not be a problem for djokovic with his incredible mental strength.
"it's not the first time that i play an epic semi-final in a grand slam and then i have to come back in less than 48 hours and play finals," he said.
"my recovery abilities are pretty good, i must say, throughout my career .
.
.
i know what i need to do.
"djokovic was happy to relax a bit and enjoy his semi-final win over his great rival but will not take anything for granted against the greek.
"he's in great form," the serbian said.
"i think he matured as a player a lot.
clay (is) arguably his best surface.
"we played an epic five-setter last year in the semis here.
yeah, i know it's going to be another tough one.
"i'm hoping i can recharge my batteries as much as i can because i'm going to need some power and energy for that one.

															afp paris novak djokovic can become the first man in 52 years to win all four grand slam titles twice in the french open final on sunday after conquering rafael nadal, the 'mount everest' of roland garros.
world number one djokovic takes on greece's stefanos tsitsipas for the title with tennis history on the line.
victory for the serb will take him alongside roy emerson and rod laver as the only men to capture the four majors more than once.
it's an achievement that has proved even beyond the capabilities of nadal and roger federer.
it is so rare an accomplishment that it hasn't happened since 1969 when laver completed his second calendar grand slam.
djokovic can pocket a 19th slam with victory and move just one behind the record of 20 jointly held by nadal and federer.
djokovic insists there will be no letdown physically or emotionally after reaching the final in paris for a sixth time with an epic triumph over 13-time champion nadal.
"it's not the first time that i play an epic semi-final in a grand slam and then i have to come back in less than 48 hours and play finals," said the 34-year-old.
"my recovery abilities have been pretty good throughout my career.
"his four-hour, four-set battle with nadal is already jostling for a prime spot in the list of "greatest ever matches" at the slams.
'never believed' -it featured a lung-busting 92-minute third set and required government intervention to allow the 5,000 fans inside court philippe chatrier to watch the match's conclusion despite it extending beyond the 11pm covid-19 curfew.
the 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 triumph gave djokovic the honour of being the only man to have beaten nadal in paris more than once, having first achieved it in the 2015 quarter-finals.
nadal has only lost three times in 108 matches since his title-winning debut in 2005. djokovic, the 2016 champion, said it was his best win in paris and ranked it among his "three greatest" ever performances.
"it's hard to find words bigger than all the superlatives you can think of for rafa's achievements at roland garros," said djokovic who now leads their series 30-28 and had lost three finals in the french capital to nadal.
"each time you step on the court with him, you know that you have to kind of climb mount everest to win against this guy here.
"djokovic has already admitted he's a fan of tsitsipas, proclaiming him as a grand slam champion in the making.
"he is a hard worker, dedicated, nice guy," said djokovic.
"he's very smart and wise.
i love the fact that he is more than just a tennis player and he's always looking to learn from experience and to understand something new about himself.
"that's the trait of a champion.
"djokovic will be playing in his 29th slam final on sunday.
he holds a 5-2 record over tsitsipas, a run which includes all three meetings on clay.
at last year's roland garros, djokovic won their semi-final over five sets.
"we played an epic five-setter last year in the semis here.
i know it's going to be another tough one," added djokovic who also defeated tsitsipas in rome on the eve of the french open.
"i'm hoping i can recharge my batteries as much as i can because i'm going to need some power and energy for that one.
"tsitsipas, 22, and 12 years younger than the serb, is in his first slam final having ended a run of three semi-final losses by defeating alexander zverev over five sets on friday.
victory on sunday would make him the first greek player to win a slam title.
he would also become the youngest champion in paris since nadal in 2008 and overall at the slams since juan martin del potro at the 2009 us open.
"i've never believed, have never really thought at what age this achievement might come," said tsitsipas.
"but i'm really happy with myself.
i think i've shown good discipline so far.
i've been progressive.
"tsitsipas is the hottest player on tour in 2021 with a season-leading 39 wins.
twenty-two of those have come on clay and have reaped a masters title in monte carlo as well as lyon.
tsitsipas also had a match point in the barcelona final against eventual champion nadal.
"there is the final on sunday, which is exciting.
i'm looking forward to leaving my entire body on the court," said the greek who knocked out second seed daniil medvedev in the quarter-finals.
heavy to very heavy rain is expected in the north and northeast of thailand on sunday due to tropical storm "koguma", the thai meteorological department announced in its 5am weather bulletin.
paris: after flying into the financial turbulence of the covid pandemic, the airline sector expects passenger traffic to take off despite concerns about the industry's impact on climate change.
most thais lack confidence in govt's handling of covid crisis and see political meddling in vaccine distribution, says nida poll.
paris: rafael nadal shrugged off his epic loss to novak djokovic at the french open insisting "life goes on" as the 13-time champion suffered just his third ever defeat in 108 matches in paris over 16 years.
in their 58th career clash, world number one djokovic triumphed 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 in the semi-final and stays on course to capture a 19th major and become the first man in over 50 years to win all four slams twice.
nadal, the defending champion and chasing a record-setting 21st grand slam title, refused to dwell on the consequences of his 4-hour 11-minute loss.
"i am sad to have lost in the most important tournament of the year for me, but life goes on, it is nothing more than a defeat on a tennis court," said 35-year-old nadal.
"if everything goes well, tomorrow i will be at home with my family and friends, and then we will see what is next.
"nadal said he plans to be back in 2022 although admitting that time is not on his side if he wants to re-establish his paris dominance.
had he made sunday's championship match, he would have been the oldest roland garros finalist in the modern era.
"although it is a very important tournament for me, i am aware that you cannot win it 15 or 16 times," he added.
"next year i will come again, god willing, with the belief and with the necessary work to be able to give myself another chance.
"in their 58th career meeting, and ninth at the french open, nadal had looked comfortably on course for victory when he raced to a 5-0 lead in the first set.
but 2016 champion djokovic, the man now responsible for two of nadal's losses in paris having also triumphed in the 2015 quarter-finals, hit back.
"did not hurt him"as the match progressed into the later heavier, humid and slower conditions, the world number one flourished.
he claimed a titanic 92-minute third set which had seen him serve for it at 5-4 and then have to save a set point in the 12th game.
in the fourth set, he was 0-2 down before racing away with the next six games for his second win in paris over nadal in nine meetings.
that sequence also included defeats in the 2012, 2014 and 2020 finals.
djokovic will now be playing in his sixth roland garros final and 29th at the slams.
"in the end, of course, if you win the third set you can say that was the key, because it changes the dynamic," said nadal.
"at times, my ball did not hurt him.
you have to give him credit, congratulate him, but i know i can play better on this court.
"when asked if he had faced the best djokovic performance of their 15-year rivalry, he was adamant.
"no, that's what i feel.
he has not faced my best self either.
"there were games on the limit, games that anyone could win, and today it was for him.
"despite that, there is a degree of evidence that nadal is beginning to lose more epics than he wins at the slams.
at the australian open in february, he lost to stefanos tsitsipas from two sets up in a five-set quarter-final defeat.
tsitsipas, who faces djokovic in sunday's final, is 13 years younger than nadal.
in the wimbledon semi-finals in 2018, nadal lost a final set 10-8 to djokovic after quitting injured in the fifth set of his australian open semi against marin cilic earlier that same year.
even gilles muller of luxembourg beat him at wimbledon in 2017, courtesy of a 15-13 final set.
"it doesn't matter," added a rueful nadal.
"that's tennis.
the player who gets used to the conditions better is the player who deserves to win.

paris: world number one novak djokovic said his win over rafa nadal in friday's epic french open semi-final was one of the top three matches he had played and he would remember it forever.
the 34-year-old serb lost the opening five games but hit back in magnificent fashion towin 3-6 6-3 7-6(4) 6-2in front of a raucous court philippe chatrier crowd.
he will now face greek stefanos tsitsipas in sunday's final, where he will seek a second french open title and a 19th grand slam title in total to move one behind the men's record haul held by nadal and roger federer.
"definitely the best match that i was part of at roland garros, and top three matches that i ever played in my entire career," djokovic told reporters after inflicting only a third ever french open defeat on 13-time champion nadal.
"considering the quality of tennis, playing my biggest rival on the court where he has had so much success and has been the dominant force in the last 15-plus years, and the atmosphere which was completely electric.
"one of these nights and matches you will remember forever.
"the omens did not look good for djokovic when he went 5-0 down in the first set despite playing well.
it had horrible similarities to last year's final which he lost to the spaniard 6-0 6-2 7-5, only this time he wrenched back control.
"the beginning of the match was kind of resembling last year's final," djokovic, who enjoyed loud support throughout the four-hour contest, said.
"i was not too nervous though even if i was 0-5 down because the feeling was different from last year's final, because i was just hitting the ball better and feeling better overall.
"i just kind of found my rhythm, found my groove.
there was no looking back.
even though i lost the first set, i found my game.
things started to work out really nicely.
"freshest guyeven for a man of djokovic's physical and mental resources, the emotions of friday's win might leave a hangover and he will be fully aware that the last time he beat nadal at the french open in 2015, he ended up losing the final to stan wawrinka.
"i'm not the freshest guy right now obviously.
but the good thing is that i have a day and a half to rejuvenate," he said.
"i'll enjoy this victory a little bit.
i think i deserve after this big win to just relax a little bit without thinking about the next opponent, even though it's a grand slam final.
"djokovic saved a set point at 5-6 in a pivotal third set full of spellbinding rallies before taking the tiebreak.
he then reeled off the last six games of the match to take his record over career-long rival nadal to 30-28. incredibly, djokovic is the first player in 116 matches to beat nadal in best-of-five sets on clay after losing the opener.
asked what it meant to beat nadal at a grand slam he has owned almost exclusively since 2005, djokovic said it was difficult to put into words.
"i mean, he has been the most dominant player of the roland garros history.
he lost two, now three times, in his entire career here," world number one djokovic said.
"the amount of wins that he has made on this court isincredible.
each time you step on the court with him, youknow that you have to kind of climb mount everest to win.
"it's just one of these matches that i really will remember for a very long time, not just because i won the match but because of the atmosphere, the occasion was very special.
