Singapore firm that developed COVID-19 breath test pivoted from detecting lung cancer to coronavirus.
singapore: when covid-19 hit singapore early last year, local start-up breathonix had to stop all its clinical trials for its lung cancer breathalyser test due to pandemic restrictions.
the company's ceo dr jia zhunan had been working on a way to detect disease from a person's breath since her days as a doctoral student.
but although tests for lung cancer detection had to stop, the firm soon found a new purpose a breath test for covid-19.
it was a "natural" switch because no other clinical trials were allowed at the time, and there was a lot of interest in a quick way to detect the highly infectious coronavirus, said breathonix's business development and strategy head wayne wee.
"the technology, the hardware, even the know-how is the same," the 26-year-old told cna.
"it's just collecting a different set of data.
"on may 24, breathonix announced that its covid-19 breath analysis system was the first to secure provisional authorisation in singapore.
this came a week before prime minister lee hsien loong said in anational addressthat covid-19 testing must be done "faster, and more liberally and extensively".
many different tests have become available, such as antigen rapid tests (art), saliva tests and breathalysers, mr lee noted then, adding that diy tests will also be sold at pharmacies.
trials speeded upbreathonix is supported by the national university of singapore's (nus) graduate research innovation programme.
around mid-2020, the company started a small study with the national centre of infectious diseases (ncid), and the accuracy was high enough for them to expand it to a larger trial.
as with many innovations linked to covid-19, what might have taken three years or more was then compressed into one year with clinical trials and regulatory approvals speeded up.
and the firm did it all on a budget of less than s$1 million, said mr wee.
"it was quite a steep learning curve for us (as it was our) first time doing all these things .
.
.
we tried to seek consulting help from nus.
and if that's not enough, we had to source for or hire some experts to join the team," he added.
they also had a lot of help from stakeholders like the ministry of health and ncid, said mr wee.
rather than having a swab thrust up your nose, a covid-19 test using the company's brefence go covid-19 breath test system takes just one breath.
the exhaled breath then passes into a mass spectrometer, and the breath is analysed for volatile organic compounds (voc) or biomarkers that indicate covid-19 infection.
the trick, says mr wee, is to figure out what vocs to look for and what to ignore.
for example, smokers or people who have consumed alcohol would emit certain vocs, which the analysis would omit.
it currently has an accuracy of 85.
7 per cent sensitivity and 97 per cent specificity correctly identifying those without the disease.
clinical trials are ongoing with an algorithm with artificial intelligence to further improve accuracy.
the world health organization (who) recommends a sensitivity of 80 per cent and specificity of 97 per cent for rapid antigen tests (art), while the gold standard for covid-19 tests remains the polymerase chain reaction or pcr test.
both art and pcr tests require nasal swabs.
while art tests can produce results in 30 minutes, it may take a day for pcr tests.
"less than a second to process"according to mr wee, their breath test takes only 40 to 60 seconds, which eliminates the need for a holding area while people wait for test results.
"once we capture the data from the breath, the analysis of our own algorithm takes less than a second to process .
.
.
we are able to give the results in real-time to the person on the spot," he said.
"if you're tested negative, you are cleared to go .
.
.
if you're tested positive, you will be redirected to take the pcr test and then you'll be isolated or quarantined.
"another advantage is that the test can be conducted by trained non-medical staff members.
a pilot deployment at tuas checkpoint started on may 31 and is still ongoing.
the machine is placed at different locations at the checkpoint to see if it is suited for use in such an environment.
for example, the team thought that strong winds or car fumes may affect the test results, but the performance so far has been "quite promising", said mr wee.
beyond singapore, breathonix is looking at other countries, including malaysia and vietnam, for more trials.
it has already conducted trials at changi airport, as well as in dubai, and are seeking approval in the united arab emirates.
it hopes to get full approval from singapore's health sciences authority by the end of the year.
each test costs us$5 to us$20, depending on the volume of the deployment, which is much cheaper than pcr tests, said mr wee.
it is thus useful for venues with high traffic like large events, schools, worker dormitories or workplaces where routine testing is done.
"our bigger vision is really to make breath tests (an) annual screening tool for every single individual," said mr wee.
"on top of doing a blood test and other tests, you also do a breath test, where we are able to detect and identify if you are at risk of any disease .
.
.
such as lung cancer, nose cancer, tuberculosis, maybe even flu.

it was stated that these self-testing kits, which include abbott panbio covid-19 antigen self-test, quickvue at-home otc covid-19 test, sd biosensor sars-cov-2 antigen self-test nasal and sd biosensor standard q covid-19 ag home test, have been given interim authorisation from the health sciences authority (hsa) to be sold to the general public.
moh revealed that these tests will be able to generate results in less than 20 minutes.
"they are simple to use, they can be self-administered.
from next week, jun 16, these kits will be dispensed by pharmacists at selected retail pharmacies.
we will then open up for counter sales at more retail locations progressively," said health minister ong ye kung at a multi-ministry task force press conference.
for a start, the sales will be limited to 10 art kits per person in order to make sure that there are "adequate supplies for all", but once more supplies are made available for retail sales, authorities will "eventually allow test kits to be freely purchased", said the health ministry's director of medical services kenneth mak.
as singapore prepares to ease some of its covid-19 measures from 14 june, it's important that testing can be done fast, easy and accessible, said mr ong.
associate professor mak went on to note that the self-test kits "complement" singapore's overall surveillance strategy.
"these fast and easy to use tests allow us to detect infected cases more quickly, in particular among individuals who do not have acute respiratory infection symptoms, but are concerned that they may have been exposed to covid-19," he said.
for individuals whose test results come out positive on these self-test kits, they should "immediate approach" a swab and send home public health preparedness clinic (sash phpc) for a confirmatory polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test, said moh.
it added that these individuals will then need to self-isolate until they receive a negative pcr test result.
"individuals who have ari symptoms should continue to visit a doctor for a full diagnosis and pcr test instead of relying on an art self-test kit," the ministry said.
mr ong also said in a facebook post on thursday (10 june) that these kits are available for sale at watson, guardian and unity outlets.
in a separate press release on thursday, the hsa also noted that the self-test kits can be purchased without a doctor's prescription.
arts identify the viral proteins in the nasal swab samples of covid-19 positive people and "usually work best in the early stages of infection", said the authority.
"in general, arts can achieve a sensitivity of about 80 per cent for cases with higher viral loads and a specificity range of 97 to 100 per cent," said the hsa.
the authority explained that sensitivity means the test's ability to correctly identify covid-19 in individuals without the disease, meanwhile specificity refers to the test's ability to identify individuals without covid-19.
arts have lower sensitivity than pcr tests, and this means that the rapid tests have a "higher change of false negative results".
all arts come with pamphlets with instructions on how to use, and hsa encouraged consumers to read these carefully before using the tests.
"users should collect their nasal sample using the swab provided in the kit and prepare their nasal sample using the buffer and tube provided.
"once the sample is ready, users should perform the test using the test device and read the results," said the authority.

singapore: covid-19 antigen rapid test (art) kits for self-testing will be dispensed in pharmacies to the public from wednesday (jun 16), the ministry of health (moh) announced on jun 10. arts detect the viral proteins in the nasal swab samples of infected individuals and usually work best in the early stages of infection.
four self-test kits have received interim authorisation from the health sciences authority (hsa) to be sold to the general public: the abbott panbio covid-19 antigen self-test, quickvue at-home otc covid-19 test, sd biosensor sars-cov-2 antigen self-test nasal, and sd biosensor standard q covid-19 ag home test.
according to the health ministry, these tests produce results in less than 20 minutes.
if you're planning to pick some up when they go on sale, here's what you need to know about these self-test kits.
q: where can i get the art self-test kits?a: the kits will be available at selected unity, watsons and guardian outlets islandwide.
from jun 16, these kits will be dispensed by pharmacists at selected retail pharmacies, said health minister ong ye kung on jun 10.
"we will then open up for counter sales at more retail locations progressively," he added.
the test kits will be dispensed by the pharmacist in-store, which means customers have to consult a pharmacist before purchasing them.
they can be bought without a doctor's prescription, said hsa in an update on jun 10. according to quantum technologies global, the distributor of the quickvue tests, training will be provided to pharmacists on how to teach customers on the correct usage of the tests.
all 79 guardian stores with an in-store pharmacy will carry the covid-19 art kits including the guardian store at the giant outlet in suntec city, said a dairy farm group spokesperson in response to cna's queries.
customers can visit guardian's website to use the "pharmacy" filter to locate these stores.
the abbott panbiotm covid-19 antigen self-test and the quickvue at-home otc covid-19 test will be available at guardian outlets, the spokesperson added.
39 unity pharmacies will offer the test kits from jun 16, said a fairprice spokesperson in response to cna's queries.
these stores were "specially selected" as they have in-store pharmacists who are "professionally trained" to assess whether customers are suitable to use the art kits and provide information on how to use them, said the spokesperson.
the abbot panbio covid-19 antigen self-test and quidel quickvue at-home otc covid-19 test kits will be available at all watsons pharmacy stores in the first phase of the test kit roll out, said a spokesperson for the company.
the self-test kits will be gradually expanded to more watsons stores and watsons online in the second phase, the spokesperson said in response to cna queries.
consumers will be able to locate watsons pharmacy stores using the store finder option on the company's website or via the store locator on the watsons sg mobile app.
q: how much will the test kits cost and how many can i buy?sales will initially be limited to 10 art kits per person to ensure that there are "adequate supplies for all", said the health ministry's director of medical services kenneth mak on jun 10. but as more supplies are made available for retail sales, authorities will "eventually allow test kits to be freely purchased", he said.
according to watsons, the pharmacy will be keeping with moh's recommended guidelines for the selling price of the kits.
this ranges from s$10 to s$13 per test kit depending on the size of the pack purchased, said the spokesperson.
"we would advise the public to keep to the guidelines of maximum 10 test kits per customer so as to ensure there would be sufficient test kits for everyone.
we would be monitoring the demands closely and stock up to meet with the consumer needs," the spokesperson added.
the fairprice spokesperson said that details on the type of kits and pricing are still being finalised, and more information will be available soon.
dairy farm's spokesperson also said the company will adhere to moh's pricing guidelines.
cna has contacted the ministry for more information about the price of the self-test kits.
from jun 16, quantum technologies global will have about 500,000 tests available, and more kits will be flown in from the united states in the coming weeks, said a company spokesperson in response to cna queries.
abbott is "well-positioned" to fulfill the demand for covid-19 tests, said abbott's apac divisional vice-president for rapid diagnostics sanjeev johar.
"we expect to make millions of panbio antigen rapid tests available for singapore over the coming months, as needed," he added.
q: how do these test kits work?
what should i look out for?those using the self-test kits should collect their nasal sample using the swabs provided in the kits, said hsa in the press release on jun 10. they should then prepare their nasal sample with the buffer and tube provided.
once the sample is ready, users should use it with the test device and read the results, said hsa.
while performing the test, users should follow the instructions in the instruction leaflets to get valid results, the authorities said.
the instructions for all four self-test kits may differ slightly.
for example, the quickvue test uses a test strip dipped in the buffer solution, while the one manufactured by abbott involves dripping the buffer solution on a rapid test device.
"for children younger than 14 years, an adult caretaker should help collect the nasal samples and conduct the test procedures," said abbott.
q: are these test kits effective and accurate?
what should i do if i test positive?in general, arts can achieve a sensitivity of about 80 per cent for cases with higher viral loads and a specificity range of 97 to 100 per cent, said hsa.
sensitivity refers to the test's ability to correctly detect covid-19 in individuals with the , while specificity refers to the test's ability to correctly identify individuals without covid-19.
arts have lower sensitivity than the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) tests, which means such tests have a "higher chance of false negative results", said hsa in the press release.
incorrect sample preparation or testing process when using the test, or a low viral protein level in the user's nasal sample – for example, one to two days after potential exposure to the virus – could also result in a false negative result, hsa added.
infectious diseases expert dr leong hoe nam urged users to follow the instructions on how to use the test kits strictly and "to the letter".
a properly done test will "carry a similar sensitivity" to a pcr test, especially if it's repeated every three to five days, he added.
"a negative test doesn't mean you don't have it but you're less likely to have covid-19," said dr leong.
q: what should i do if i see a positive result?people who have a positive result on these self-test kits should "immediately approach" a swab and send home public health preparedness clinic (sash phpc) for a confirmatory pcr test, said moh.
after that, they must self-isolate until they receive a negative pcr test result, moh added.
those who test negative on their self-test art kit should continue to stay vigilant and adhere to prevailing safe management measures, said the health ministry.
"individuals who have ari symptoms should continue to visit a doctor for a full diagnosis and pcr test instead of relying on an art self-test kit.

singapore from june 16, self-administered covid-19 test kits will be sold in pharmacies here as increased testing becomes part of the "new normal" way of life with the coronavirus.
having previously undergone five different types of covid-19 swabs, including one done by a robot, i decided to try one of these do-it-yourself test kits to see what the process was like, and how it compared with the other types of tests.
the kit i tried was the abbott panbio covid-19 antigen self-test.
another test that will be available is the quidel quickvue at-home otc covid-19 test.
these two will be sold at watsons outlets for around $10 to $13 per test kit.
two more, the sd biosensor sars-cov-2 antigen self-test nasal, and the sd biosensor standard q covid-19 ag home test, have been approved for use here by the health sciences authority.
the abbott panbio sample kit came in a blue rectangular box the size of a pencil case.
inside, there were an instruction manual, a swab, a test device, a tiny bottle of solution, and a tube to hold the mixture.
a resealable plastic bag was also provided for waste disposal.
before starting, i had to wash and dry my hands.
then, i had to squeeze liquid from the bottle into the tube, making sure it was filled up to a specific level.
setting the tube of liquid aside, i went on to the swab.
removing the stick from its sealed packaging, i took a deep breath and gently pushed it into my nostril.
this was the most difficult step for me as i was not sure whether the swab had gone sufficiently deep inside.
the instructions said to insert it about 2cm deep, until resistance was felt, but being paranoid i was not 100 per cent confident that i was feeling enough resistance.
i should perhaps have done this in front of a mirror.
i then rotated the swab five times as instructed, ensuring i felt it gently rub the insides of my nose.
this step had to be repeated for the other nostril with the same swab.
at this point, i was a little more confident of my abilities, and felt more relaxed.
next, i put the stick into the tube of liquid and swirled it, before breaking off the swab along a demarcated line and leaving it in the tube.
i then squeezed five droplets from the tube into the test device.
i did not need to worry about spilling as there was more than enough liquid in the tube.
almost instantly, the display face of the test device began to turn red.
it felt like i was carrying out a science experiment at home.
a single line on the control indicator means a negative result.

fifteen minutes later, i checked the device and saw that nearly all the redness had disappeared, leaving a single line on the control indicator a negative result.
a positive result would show two red lines.
with a sigh of relief, i sealed the used equipment in the resealable bag and threw it in the bin.
the entire kit can be used only once, and no, i didn't want to keep it as a souvenir.
overall, i found the test quick and simple to use.
it was definitely much less uncomfortable than the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) swab tests i had taken in the past because the swab did not have to be put all the way up my nose, and for me at least it was completely painless.
while i was initially surprised by the number of steps required, the manual was very detailed, contained helpful diagrams, and was easy to follow.

dr ling li min, an infectious diseases specialist at rophi clinic, told me that although there may be some minor variations between the four approved kits, all are antigen rapid tests (arts) and should work the same way.
unlike pcr tests, which detect genetic material from the coronavirus, arts look for antigens, which are the protein shells that cover the virus, she explained.
dr ling, who was previously a senior consultant at the national centre for infectious diseases and tan tock seng hospital, said there are membranes in the test kit containing antibodies.
when the solution is dripped on the test kit, it flows through the membranes.
if there are antigens present, the antibodies will bind with them and form a line on the display.

while arts are faster and less uncomfortable than pcr tests, they are less sensitive.
dr ling said that generally, pcr tests can detect the virus in someone who has symptoms in their first week of illness about 90 to 95 per cent of the time.
arts can do this for an estimated 70 to 80 per cent of cases.
however, dr ling noted that arts have a specificity rate of nearly 100 per cent, which means that a positive result is very likely correct.
"if it's positive, you must really quickly go and see a doctor.
the chance of a false positive is very, very low," she said.
she cautioned that those using diy test kits must read and follow the instructions even if they have used a different brand before as there may be some variations, and the reliability of the result depends on people doing the test correctly.
but while such kits may not be suitable for those who are unable to follow instructions or have trouble carrying out the test on their own, such as the very old or young, dr ling said they have an important part to play in the nation's overall strategy to combat covid-19.
this is because such kits can help increase the frequency of tests done here, potentially allowing cases to be detected and tackled before they turn into clusters.
from a psychological point of view, they can also help give peace of mind to people who want to know if they are infected, she said.
dr ling added: "if we do it well and properly, and if enough people buy into it, it's one way to keep from needing heightened restrictions every now and then, and we can carry on with our lives.

simply through more testing that people are going to be comfortable with.

covid-19 self-test kits will be sold by pharmacists at guardian, unity and watsons pharmacies from next wednesday, said the ministry of health (moh) yesterday.
health minister ong ye kung, during an update by the multi-ministry task force on covid-19, said: "as we want to resume more activities, we need to make testing fast, easy and accessible.
"sales will initially be limited to 10 antigen rapid test (art) kits each person to ensure there are adequate supplies.

for individuals whose test results come out positive on these self-test kits, they should "immediate approach" a swab and send home public health preparedness clinic (sash phpc) for a confirmatory polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test, said moh.
it added that these individuals will then need to self-isolate until they receive a negative pcr test result.
"individuals who have ari symptoms should continue to visit a doctor for a full diagnosis and pcr test instead of relying on an art self-test kit," the ministry said.
mr ong also said in a facebook post on thursday (10 june) that these kits are available for sale at watson, guardian and unity outlets.
in a separate press release on thursday, the hsa also noted that the self-test kits can be purchased without a doctor's prescription.
arts identify the viral proteins in the nasal swab samples of covid-19 positive people and "usually work best in the early stages of infection", said the authority.
"in general, arts can achieve a sensitivity of about 80 per cent for cases with higher viral loads and a specificity range of 97 to 100 per cent," said the hsa.
the authority explained that sensitivity means the test's ability to correctly identify covid-19 in individuals without the disease, meanwhile specificity refers to the test's ability to identify individuals without covid-19.
arts have lower sensitivity than pcr tests, and this means that the rapid tests have a "higher change of false negative results".
all arts come with pamphlets with instructions on how to use, and hsa encouraged consumers to read these carefully before using the tests.
"users should collect their nasal sample using the swab provided in the kit and prepare their nasal sample using the buffer and tube provided.
"once the sample is ready, users should perform the test using the test device and read the results," said the authority.
