lee joonmin was riding along woodlands road on monday evening (june 7) when he saw the flash of a blue and red light in his motorcycle's rearview mirror.
when he realised a traffic police officer was tailing him, the 23-year-old dispatch supervisor broke into a sweat.
"to my horror, i saw the [traffic police] officer was gesturing at me to pull over," lee said in a facebook post later that evening.
it soon went viral with over 1,200 shares.
he was stunned when the officer revealed why he was getting "booked".
[embed]https://www.
facebook.
com/chifferon/posts/4324023350982616[/embed]speaking with asiaone, lee said many thoughts raced through his mind as he dismounted his motorcycle, including "oh no, what did i do", "there goes my money", "did i fail to signal?
"he recounted how there was a "super awkward and longest sentence pause of [his] entire life" before the officer told him what he was actually pulled over for.
lee was given a reward for being a safety role model to other motorcyclists on the road, as he was wearing protective riding gear.
only then did lee breathe a sigh of relief and graciously accepted the reward — a bag filled with a mask, hand sanitiser, surface sanitiser, wet tissues, an ez-link card and a pouch.
"i never expected this to happen to me," he said.
"[the officer] really had me there.
"lee isn't the only person to have been pulled over by the traffic police for being a good noodle.
since the introduction of the "reward the riders" initiative in 2019, the traffic police have been recognising and rewarding numerous motorcyclists who wear protective gear and display good riding behaviour on the road.
[embed]https://twitter.
com/singaporepolice/status/1177967230400659456[/embed]despite the heat, the expensive riding gear and the social stigma that comes with wearing the full outfit, lee said he chose to wear the protective wear as he knew the pain that came with traffic accidents.
"i crashed three whole times within my first month of riding," he sheepishly admitted.

singapore a cyclist who punched a lorry driver in a road rage incident was fined $5,600 on thursday (june 10).
jeffery todd martin, 57, a canadian and a singapore permanent resident, pleaded guilty to one count each of voluntarily causing hurt and riding his bicycle without due regard for the safety of others.
at about 10.
20am on feb 24, 2019, martin was cycling in jalan eunos when a lorry overtook him.
he later overtook the lorry, pointing at the driver as he did so, and stopped in the middle of the lane in front of the vehicle.
this caused the lorry to stop amid moving traffic.
martin got off his bike and hit the driver's window, hurling vulgarities at the driver as he did so.
the lorry driver, chinese national zhang ping, 33, then moved his vehicle sharply towards martin, forcing him to step away.
zhang alighted from the lorry, holding an orange flask as he approached martin.
once confronted, martin punched him in the face, causing zhang to fall.
martin later cycled away as zhang remained in a daze sitting on the road.
zhang suffered cuts on his lips as a result of the punch, and was given medical leave for two days.
he was previously dealt with, and was jailed for a week for one count of a rash act endangering others.
a 30-second video of the incident had gone viral after the incident in 2019, and zhang had been arrested within 48 hours.
the same video was played in court on thursday.
after playing the video for the court, deputy public prosecutor emily koh said the prosecution would not be pushing for a custodial sentence, as the attack was one of low harm and culpability.
district judge brenda tan noted that prior to the punch, it was zhang who had come out from the vehicle to confront martin.
she said that while the custodial threshold had not been crossed, a high fine was warranted.
for voluntarily causing hurt, martin could have been jailed for up to two years on top of the maximum $5,000 fine he received for the charge.
for not riding his bicycle in an orderly manner with due regard for the safety of others, he could have been jailed for up to three months and fined up to $1,000.

singapore a football talent scout thought another man was making a rude gesture, and attacked the latter near his daughter's school in a road rage incident.
for that, marco paulo goncalves guimaraes, 43, has been jailed for three weeks.
the portuguese man was also fined $1,000 for not wearing a mask.
he pleaded guilty to the two charges on thursday (june 10) and was ordered to compensate the victim.
guimaraes is a fifa licensed players' agent who scouted for talent here and in the region to play in european football clubs.
he came to singapore in 2004 and founded the football management international company in 2010. on july 11 last year, at about 1pm, he went to pick his seven-year-old daughter from oasis primary school in punggol.
he drove along edgefield plains, the road just outside the school, intending to wait with other cars along the road for his daughter.
but another driver honked at him along the road.
after he gave way, he thought he saw the man make a rude gesture with his finger while driving past.
guimaraes then tailed the man in his car, confronting him without a mask on, at the loading bay of a nearby housing block.
as the victim was alighting from his car, guimaraes pushed the car door, causing it to hit the victim's shin.
he also grabbed the victim's wrist and they began arguing.
when the victim got out of his car, guimaraes pushed him.
the court heard that guimaraes hurled vulgarities at the victim throughout the encounter and put on a mask only when the victim started taking a video with his phone.
guimaraes also slapped the victim at the side of his head and kicked him before the police arrived.
on thursday, the court was told that guimaraes was deeply ashamed of his conduct and was pleading for leniency.
for voluntarily causing hurt, he could have been jailed for up to two years, or fined up to $5,000, or both.
