it interviewed him to establish if he had engaged in activities prejudicial to singapore's security.
the department said on tuesday that yeo carried out intelligence activities against singapore from 2016 until his arrest in the us in 2019.  he was tasked to source for information and provide reports on issues of interest to his foreign handlers, including information relating to singapore.

"yeo admitted to being fully aware that his foreign handlers were working for the intelligence apparatus of the foreign state.
"isd said investigations are ongoing and that yeo's "continued detention is necessary to facilitate probes into the full extent of his activities".
yeo was jailed in the us on oct 9 last year after admitting to operating illegally as a foreign agent, which can bring up to 10 years in prison.
he was given a relatively light sentence and credited for 11 months already spent in prison because of his cooperation with us authorities and the threat of contracting covid-19 in jail, a us federal judge said then.

yeo told these people that the reports were for clients in asia, without revealing that they were in fact for the chinese government.
yeo also told us investigators that his previous intelligence work targeted other asian countries before focusing on the us.

huang was permanently banned from singapore and had his permanent residency status revoked, mha said.
huang left singapore in 2017. lkyspp told cna on tuesday evening that it has strengthened "oversight and risk-awareness procedures" in relation to its education and research.

singapore dickson yeo had approached various people in singapore, relying heavily on social networking platforms to reach out to them and gather information at the behest of a foreign country, said the internal security department (isd).
he had also attempted to find jobs in a range of positions in the government, thinking that he could access information of interest to his foreign handlers.
however, the department's investigations showed that no classified government information pertaining to singapore had been compromised as a result of yeo's activities, a spokesman told the straits times on tuesday (june 15).
earlier in the day, the agency overseeing domestic security announced that yeo had been detained for two years under the internal security act (isa) for acting as a paid agent of a foreign state.
he was arrested by the isd on dec 30 last year after he was deported to singapore from the united states upon completion of a 14-month jail term for spying for china in the us.
yeo was issued an order of detention under the isa on jan 29. responding to queries from the straits times, the department said yeo was tasked by his foreign handlers to gather information on a wide range of subjects, primarily global and regional geo-political issues and developments.
"he had relied heavily and successfully on social networking platforms to reach out to individuals with the relevant expertise, knowledge and access.
he had pitched taskings to his resource persons as 'research topics' for his various foreign clients.
"the isd said it was unable to provide further details on the professions of these individuals or the number of persons involved.
the agency also said that yeo had tried to gain employment in a range of positions in the public sector positions and agencies he believed would allow him access to information of interest to his foreign handlers.
it added that it could not provide specific details of these jobs, citing operational and security reasons.
people looking to join the public sector in positions that require access to classified information will have to undergo security clearance, the isd said.
several factors are taken into consideration in this process, including the nature of the work and the sensitivity of the information dealt with.
"security checks will vary for different positions which have different levels of access to confidential information," the department added.
yeo's path to being a spy started during a trip to beijing in 2015, when he was recruited by chinese agents who claimed to represent think-tanks.
he was studying for a doctorate at the lee kuan yew school of public policy (lkyspp) at the national university of singapore at the time.
when news of yeo's activities broke after he pleaded guilty in a us court last july, the school terminated his phd candidature "with immediate effect".
at the time, retired diplomat bilahari kausikan revealed that one of yeo's former professors at the school was huang jing until 2017, when the academic was expelled from singapore "for being a chinese agent of influence".
on tuesday, an lkyspp spokesman said the past incidents involving its former staff member and former student show how different sectors in society, including education, can be potential targets for foreign subversion.
the best safeguard against illegal foreign subversion is a community that is aware and vigilant, she added.
the spokesman stressed that the school will not tolerate any acts or activities of foreign interference that threaten singapore's national security or interests.
its staff and students are also expected to conduct themselves fully in accordance with the laws of singapore at all times.
she added that the school has strengthened its procedures, saying: "we maintain an enhanced oversight on academic collaborations and partnerships, both local and overseas, and will also continue to keep a heightened awareness among all our staff and students on the risks of foreign interference.
"professor joseph liow, dean of the college of humanities, arts and social sciences, and tan kah kee chair in comparative and international politics at nanyang technological university, said of yeo's activities: "academics and researchers should be aware that these sorts of things happen in real life, and are not merely the stuff of spy novels or hollywood movies.
"foreign powers spy all the time, and spying is conducted in many ways, which have evolved with technology, he noted.
and one could say that by virtue of being a very open country, singapore is vulnerable to such activities, added prof liow.
"i wouldn't say that we have to be exceedingly worried about this, but we certainly need to be aware that such things take place, and also be alert to requests that appear unusual," he said.
"it's not happening on a daily basis, and of course our security agencies spend a lot of time making sure such activities don't take place.
but nevertheless as academics, researchers, or just regular citizens, we need to exercise some common sense and be vigilant.

singapore students and staff who experience racism in schools should bring it up to their institutions immediately for investigations to be conducted, and those engaging in racist acts will be counselled and disciplined, the ministry of education (moe) said on thursday (june 17).
the ministry was responding to the straits times' queries about recent allegations of racism on social media platforms like instagram and facebook, where users from minority communities recounted incidents of alleged racism in public schools, including racial bullying by former classmates and discrimination by teachers.
a spokesman for the moe said that any form of racism is unacceptable and has no place in local schools.
she added that the ministry also expects educators to maintain high standards on this matter.
"we expect all educators to conduct themselves to the highest standards of their profession, given their position of influence over their students, and we will not hesitate to take the appropriate disciplinary actions against offenders," the spokesman said.
"our schools aim to provide a supportive and safe environment where students and staff, regardless of their race and religion, can build strong and positive relationships, voice their concerns, and seek help from their teachers and peers.
"the ministry said schools here provide a common space for students to learn the values of respect and harmony, regardless of race, language or religion.
the spokesman added: "within the classroom, topics on multiculturalism and the importance of racial harmony are taught in subjects like character and citizenship education, history and social studies.
"these values are practised and reinforced beyond the classroom as students interact with one another during student development experiences like cca and cohort camps.
"the moe also said that teachers are provided with resources and training to establish a caring and enabling environment in school by fostering strong teacher-student and peer relationships.
all schools will have a peer support structure in place by the end of this year, where students can support one another and are taught to speak up for peers when necessary, the ministry added.

singapore dickson yeo had approached various people in singapore, relying heavily on social networking platforms to reach out to them and gather information at the behest of a foreign country, said the internal security department (isd).
he had also attempted to find jobs in a range of positions in the government, thinking that he could access information of interest to his foreign handlers.
however, the department's investigations showed that no classified government information pertaining to singapore had been compromised as a result of yeo's activities, a spokesman told the straits times on tuesday (june 15).
earlier in the day, the agency overseeing domestic security announced that yeo had been detained for two years under the internal security act (isa) for acting as a paid agent of a foreign state.
he was arrested by the isd on dec 30 last year after he was deported to singapore from the united states upon completion of a 14-month jail term for spying for china in the us.
yeo was issued an order of detention under the isa on jan 29. responding to queries from the straits times, the department said yeo was tasked by his foreign handlers to gather information on a wide range of subjects, primarily global and regional geo-political issues and developments.
"he had relied heavily and successfully on social networking platforms to reach out to individuals with the relevant expertise, knowledge and access.
he had pitched taskings to his resource persons as 'research topics' for his various foreign clients.
"the isd said it was unable to provide further details on the professions of these individuals or the number of persons involved.
the agency also said that yeo had tried to gain employment in a range of positions in the public sector positions and agencies he believed would allow him access to information of interest to his foreign handlers.
it added that it could not provide specific details of these jobs, citing operational and security reasons.
people looking to join the public sector in positions that require access to classified information will have to undergo security clearance, the isd said.
several factors are taken into consideration in this process, including the nature of the work and the sensitivity of the information dealt with.
"security checks will vary for different positions which have different levels of access to confidential information," the department added.
yeo's path to being a spy started during a trip to beijing in 2015, when he was recruited by chinese agents who claimed to represent think-tanks.
he was studying for a doctorate at the lee kuan yew school of public policy (lkyspp) at the national university of singapore at the time.
when news of yeo's activities broke after he pleaded guilty in a us court last july, the school terminated his phd candidature "with immediate effect".
at the time, retired diplomat bilahari kausikan revealed that one of yeo's former professors at the school was huang jing until 2017, when the academic was expelled from singapore "for being a chinese agent of influence".
on tuesday, an lkyspp spokesman said the past incidents involving its former staff member and former student show how different sectors in society, including education, can be potential targets for foreign subversion.
the best safeguard against illegal foreign subversion is a community that is aware and vigilant, she added.
the spokesman stressed that the school will not tolerate any acts or activities of foreign interference that threaten singapore's national security or interests.
its staff and students are also expected to conduct themselves fully in accordance with the laws of singapore at all times.
she added that the school has strengthened its procedures, saying: "we maintain an enhanced oversight on academic collaborations and partnerships, both local and overseas, and will also continue to keep a heightened awareness among all our staff and students on the risks of foreign interference.
"professor joseph liow, dean of the college of humanities, arts and social sciences, and tan kah kee chair in comparative and international politics at nanyang technological university, said of yeo's activities: "academics and researchers should be aware that these sorts of things happen in real life, and are not merely the stuff of spy novels or hollywood movies.
"foreign powers spy all the time, and spying is conducted in many ways, which have evolved with technology, he noted.
and one could say that by virtue of being a very open country, singapore is vulnerable to such activities, added prof liow.
"i wouldn't say that we have to be exceedingly worried about this, but we certainly need to be aware that such things take place, and also be alert to requests that appear unusual," he said.
"it's not happening on a daily basis, and of course our security agencies spend a lot of time making sure such activities don't take place.
but nevertheless as academics, researchers, or just regular citizens, we need to exercise some common sense and be vigilant.

"the singapore government takes a very serious view of anyone who enters into a clandestine relationship with a foreign government and engages in activities at the behest of the foreign power that is inimical to our national security and interests, including bilateral relations," said the isd on tuesday.

singapore: singaporean dickson yeo was detained under the internal security act (isa) on jan 29 for acting as a paid agent for a "foreign state", the internal security department (isd) said on tuesday (jun 15).
while isd did not name the foreign state, yeo, 40, was last year sentenced to 14 months' prison in the us for spying for china against the us.
isdarrested yeo after he was deported to singaporeon dec 30 last year after he served his sentence.
it interviewed him to establish if he had engaged in activities prejudicial to singapore's security.
the department said on tuesday that yeo carried out intelligence activities against singapore from 2016 until his arrest in the us in 2019.  he was tasked to source for information and provide reports on issues of interest to his foreign handlers, including information relating to singapore.
"towards this end, he had approached various individuals in singapore in an attempt to obtain information for the purpose of writing his reports," isd said.
yeo also set up a front company in singapore as a cover for his information-gathering activities as well as recruitment for his foreign handlers.
he also tried, but failed, to get a job in the singapore government.
"isd's investigations established that yeo had worked for the intelligence apparatus of a foreign state and had carried out various taskings given to him by his foreign handlers in exchange for monetary gains.
"yeo admitted to being fully aware that his foreign handlers were working for the intelligence apparatus of the foreign state.
"isd said investigations are ongoing and that yeo's "continued detention is necessary to facilitate probes into the full extent of his activities".
yeo was jailed in the us on oct 9 last year after admitting to operating illegally as a foreign agent, which can bring up to 10 years in prison.
he was given a relatively light sentence and credited for 11 months already spent in prison because of his cooperation with us authorities and the threat of contracting covid-19 in jail, a us federal judge said then.
in his plea, yeo admitted to working between 2015 and 2019 for chinese intelligence, spotting and assessing americans with access to "valuable non-public information".
they included a civilian working on the us air force's f-35b stealth fighter project, a pentagon army officer with afghanistan experience, and a state department official, all of whom were paid as much as us$2,000 to write reports for yeo.
yeo told these people that the reports were for clients in asia, without revealing that they were in fact for the chinese government.
yeo was recruited by chinese intelligence operatives while studying for a phd at the national university of singapore's lee kuan yew school of public policy (lkyspp) in 2015.  he went on to work for the chinese after he visited beijing to give a presentation on politics.
former top singapore diplomat bilahari kausikan said that yeo's phd supervisor at lkyspp was huang jing.
the professor was identified in 2017 as an "agent of influence for a foreign country" by singapore's ministry of home affairs (mha).
without naming the country, mha said huang "knowingly interacted with intelligence organisations and agents of the foreign country, and cooperated with them to influence the singapore government's foreign policy and public opinion in singapore".
huang gave what he claimed was "privileged information" about the foreign country to prominent and influential singaporeans, including a senior member of lkyspp, with the aim of influencing their opinions in favour of that country, mha said.
huang was permanently banned from singapore and had his permanent residency status revoked, mha said.
huang left singapore in 2017. yeo also told us investigators that his previous intelligence work targeted other asian countries before focusing on the us.
mha said on jul 26 last year that its investigations into yeo's activities did not reveal any direct threat to singapore's security.
on tuesday, isd said the singapore government takes a "very serious view of anyone who enters into a clandestine relationship with a foreign government".
this includes those who engage in activities at the behest of the foreign power that may harm singapore's national security and interests, including bilateral relations, it said.
