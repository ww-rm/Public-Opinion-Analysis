the second nationwide home-based learning (hbl) exercise for students will come to an end in stages, the ministry of education (moe) announced yesterday.
primary 4 to 6 pupils, secondary 3 to 5 and all junior college and millennia institute students will be the first to return to school on june 28.  secondary 1 and 2 students will return to school from july 1 and the rest will go back from july 6. those sitting psle and n-, o- and a-level examinations this year have had to live with the coronavirus for more than a year now and been forced to make unprecedented adjustments while preparing for the milestone tests.
dr jason tan, associate professor in the policy, curriculum and leadership academic group at the national institute of education, said negotiating two hbl sessions and adjusting to various safety measures both in and out of school would have been challenging.
"these exams play an important role in determining the next stages of the students' lives and having them amid the disruptions caused by the virus is certainly not ideal," he told the new paper yesterday.
"this period is already a stressful one for them, knowing the importance of these exams.
faced with social isolation like being apart from their classmates and not having co-curricular activities is bound to affect their social and emotional well-being, which also plays a part in how they do academically.
"on may 16, moe announced that all students would move to hbl from may 19, the second such exercise since the virus appeared here early last year.
the current mid-year holidays started on may 29 and end on june 27. last year's hbl was from april 8 to may 5, during the circuit breaker, when singapore went into a lockdown from april 7 to june 1. ms vivien le, founder of le xue education group, a chinese education centre, believes many of the students taking crucial exams this year would have found it tough.
the former moe teacher said: "this year's cohort had to go through two rounds of disruptions.
"students who find it more challenging learning online may find it difficult since a portion of their syllabus from these two years were taught online, especially when it comes to the foundation topics taught last year.
"but she noted that some learning styles may be suited to online learning.
miss ren yun ting, 18, a second-year student at tampines meridian junior college, said she was productive during the recent hbl exercise as she continued preparing for her upcoming a-level exams.
she said: "the school uploaded a lot of information and resources such as mock exam papers for us to do, and i had the flexibility to plan my time on how i wanted to revise.
"while she missed meeting her friends and having fun in school, the time she saved on travelling and attending co-curricular activity sessions helped with revision work.
"i may not be able to say i am 100 per cent confident to take the exams now, but i am definitely making great use of my holidays to consolidate my learning, and i am well prepared for my upcoming exams, which is an important milestone before the a levels," she added.
some have struggled more.
madam lunny liu, 50, a tutor, said her 11-year-old daughter, who will sit the primary school leaving examination later this year, found the hbl less effective.
"she never had very good self-discipline and home-based learning made it worse.
also, it affected her understanding of some lessons taught in class because she does better with physical interaction.
"students taking the psle and n-, o- and a-level exams face huge pressure, and ms le said the pandemic could exacerbate the strain.
a mother who wanted to be known only as mrs lim said despite the challenges that her 12-year-old daughter has had to face, they have learnt to adapt as the psle draws closer.
the 41-year-old sales manager said: "last year, my daughter was complaining about the safe management measures in school such as having to wear masks the whole day.
"she does not complain now and is looking forward to returning to school to prepare for her exams.
"while it has been disruptive, especially when tuition classes were shifted online, this pandemic has taught us to go with the flow and expect these constant changes.

singapore home-based learning (hbl) has been challenging for parents especially those juggling busy work schedules but they understand the need for caution in the ministry of education's (moe) move to progressively allow students back to school after the june holidays.
moe had announced the move on monday (june 14), adding that the aim is to keep students and staff safe from covid-19.
from june 28, when term 3 begins, primary 1 to 3 pupils will continue with a week of hbl.
they will return to school on tuesday, july 6, as monday is a school holiday.
secondary 1 and 2 students will also be on hbl for three days till june 30, and return to school on thursday, july 1. students in primary 4 to 6, secondary 3 to 5, junior colleges and the millennia institute will return to school on june 28. parents the straits times spoke to on tuesday welcomed the move, though some noted that there could be challenges that could be stressful for both parents and children.
mrs joanna tan, 41, feels the staggered return is a good way to reassure parents of their children's safety.
"younger children tend to get excited to see their friends on the first day back at school (which could lead to them not keeping to safe distancing measures)," she said.
having one week of hbl could help them to adjust back to school without such risks, said the housewife, who has a son in primary 6 and a daughter in primary 2. but another parent, ms carmen li, 38, said hbl can be challenging and has "added extra stress to both parent and child".
she has an intense work schedule, she said, and it has been difficult to rush her own work while giving her primary 3 daughter attention or technical support when needed.
"primary 3 children are still dependent on their parents," said, ms li, who works in human resources.
she added that her daughter uses her phone at times to call her teacher.
"i need to be on standby for her if she cannot get through homework.
it is almost like i need to be right next to her.
"ms li said she hopes schools can suggest a self-directed timetable for children beyond school to support parents in dealing with their children's social needs and fight boredom.
mr elgin teng, 39, whose daughter is in primary 1, said he was not surprised to hear of the move, given the trend in community cases and how the end of the june holidays was approaching.
said mr teng, a learning and development consultant, of his daughter: "she gets to spend more time with the family and learn about.
.
.
how we make a living.
we also get to spend more time together over meals, so we see that as a good thing for her, although not so much for us parents because we now need to multitask.
"the homework load is not too heavy in primary 1, but the challenge is when the work is done and his daughter starts to seek parental attention, mr teng added.
"the school is a valuable place for every child to grow in their social awareness, relationship management and face-to-face interactions.
.
.
a shorter hbl might be healthier as a child's well-being needs to be extended into the space of physical interactions and also parents' space for mental rest.
"mr graham teo, 42, who has a child in secondary 1, also noted that while each singaporean has a part to play in keeping the country safe, "an integral part of going to school is the social interaction with friends and teachers".
learning and working from home will be a part of the future, and schools are doing well under the circumstances, said mr teo, who works in procurement.
"however, with more hbl, teachers and parents need to understand that close partnership is now more crucial than ever.
both sides should reach out to each other instead of it being a one-sided effort.
"he added: "part of the fun of going to school is meeting and interacting with friends.
we also need to pick up social skills, and there is no better place than school to do it in. "

singapore: teachers are reaching out to parents and students who have not responded to invitations to take the covid-19 vaccination to offer assistance if needed, said second minister for education maliki osman on monday (jun 14).
"it could be an issue where the parents do not know how to (sign up).
it could be an issue that they are not quite familiar with the online system," he said, speaking to reporters at a vaccination centre at ite college west.
"it could also be parents have some concerns about safety.
so for that, we are asking our teachers to reach out to them.
"giving updates on thestudent vaccination exercise, dr maliki said that 345,000 text messages and invites have been sent out to eligible parents and students.
as of sunday, 300,000 students have registered and booked their slots for their vaccination.
of these students, 101,000 have received their first dose, he added.
among students from the graduating cohorts, who were the first batch of students to receive invites, 90 per cent have registered for the vaccination and 75 per cent of them have received their first doses, said dr maliki.
some parents may face challenges taking their children to the vaccination centres, such as those who are working and have younger children to care for, said dr maliki.
"for those groups, we assure them that all they need to do is when school reopens, they can get in touch with the schools, get in touch with the teachers, and the schools are ready to help facilitate bringing some of the students together perhaps to a vaccination centre, or creating better transportation facilities for them to do so," he added.
"we are still reaching out to all those who have not signed up, who have not registered, and we look forward to them understanding the support that's available for the students to be getting their vaccinations.
"monday was also the first day of vaccinations for ite students.
about nine in 10 of them have registered for the vaccination exercise, said dr maliki.
at ite college west, about 280 students took their first dose of the covid-19 vaccine on monday morning.
there are 28,000 ite students across singapore, and they can register for the vaccination directly through their schools for the centre set up in their respective colleges, said dr maliki.
all three ite college vaccination centres are open, and the fourth moe vaccination centre at raffles city convention centre will start operations on tuesday.
the education ministry hopes all students can receive their second dose by the end of august, "but that all depends" on the response rate, said dr maliki.
"it's very encouraging today.
by and large, we have about 80 to 90 per cent of responses for the different categories, and we hope more will step forward," he added.
responding to a question about whether vaccinated and non-vaccinated students will be subject to different measures when they return to school, dr maliki said: "the last thing we want is for students to be identified as 'you have been vaccinated' and 'you have not been vaccinated', because we do not want a situation where one becomes stigmatised for not being vaccinated.
"certainly, we have to respect decisions by parents, whether they would like their children to be vaccinated or not.
we hope that the environment is one where everyone in the school feels safer, now that the majority would have had their vaccination by the time they resume school at the end of june.
"dr maliki added that schools will continue to adhere to safe management measures like practising hygiene and cleanliness standards, safe distancing and the wearing of masks.
"we will continue to take guidance from the mtf (multi-ministry task force) with regard to the measures that we put in place at the national level and schools will respond accordingly," he said.

singapore vaccination has begun for all institute of technical education (ite) students on monday (june 14) now that three out of four ministry of education vaccination centres have opened.
vaccination centre operations started at ite college central in ang mo kio on june 7, at ite college east in simei on june 9 and at ite college west in choa chu kang on june 11.  the fourth centre, at raffles city convention centre, will open on tuesday.
more than 300,000 students across singapore have registered for their vaccination appointments thus far, of whom over 101,000 have taken their first dose, said second education minister maliki osman.
about 345,000 smses and invites had been sent to eligible students.
dr maliki gave reporters an update on student vaccination numbers during a visit to ite college west in choa chu kang on monday.
"our first batch, our graduating students, about 90 per cent of them have already registered, and about 75 per cent received their first doses.
"it's very encouraging to see how the students are responding to all these invitations and smses that have been given to them.
"the hope is that all students will be able to get fully vaccinated by the end of august, dr maliki added, although this will depend on the response rate.
schools are contacting parents of students who did not respond to the vaccination bulletins to find out more about their concerns, he said.
"it could be an issue where the parents may not know how to (register).
.
.
that they are not quite familiar with the online system.
"it could also be that parents have some concerns about issues of safety and so for that, we are asking teachers to reach out to them," he said.
some working parents may also face challenges in getting their children, especially the younger ones, to the vaccination centres.
"so for those groups, we can assure them that all they need to do is when school reopens, get in touch with the teachers.
"the schools are ready to help, for example, with transport arrangements, he said.
the new school term starts on june 28. it was earlier announced that singapore would roll out its vaccination exercise to more than 400,000 students in schools and institutes of higher learning, including autonomous universities, polytechnics and ite, amid more covid-19 infections among children.
those affected included students in primary and secondary schools, junior colleges, the millennia institute, madrasahs, special education schools, and the international arms of hwa chong institution, anglo-chinese school and st joseph's institution.
students had been invited to sign up for vaccination slots from june 1, starting with about 56,000 students who will be sitting major examinations like the o and a levels this year.
those aged 18 and above can opt for either the pfizer-biontech or moderna vaccine, while those aged between 12 and 17 will be offered only the pfizer jab as the moderna vaccine has not been approved for use on this younger age group.

dr maliki said the ite centres will be able to administer 1,600 doses of the vaccine a day, while the raffles city centre can do 2,000 doses a day.
this week, the three centres will provide vaccinations for ite students in the morning from 8.
30am to 11.
30am, and for all other students from 1.
30pm to 4.

from next week, the centres will be open to all students.

dr maliki also reiterated that vaccinating students is one of the many protective measures in place to ensure their safety, with the majority of students expected to receive the first dose of their vaccine by end-june when school reopens.
however, safe management measures such as mask wearing, safe distancing and staggered recess times will continue to prevail.
business student danial norizam, 16, was among the ite students vaccinated on monday morning.
he told the straits times that he was a little anxious about the side effects initially, but felt that it was important to get his vaccine in order to keep himself safe.
both his parents, who have already been vaccinated, had also encouraged him to do so.
