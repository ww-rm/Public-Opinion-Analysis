Japan clarifies no change in position, after PM Suga angers China by calling Taiwan a 'country', East Asia News & Top Stories.
written by roger cohena new israeli government united in its determination to oust prime minister benjamin netanyahu, but in agreement on little else, is set to take office sunday under a right-wing leader whose eight-party coalition includes the left and, for the first time, an independent arab party.
it looks like a recipe for chronic instability.
even sunday's confidence vote in the knesset, or parliament, that would usher in the first change in israeli leadership in a dozen years is not a done deal, given the razor-thin majority of naftali bennett's coalition with its 61 seats in the 120-member chamber.
but every indication is that the votes to make bennett prime minister are locked in, absent some eleventh-hour drama.
a signed coalition agreement was formally presented to the knesset secretariat friday, the last step before a vote and the swearing-in of the new government.
survival will then become the issue.
israel's parliamentary democracy veered in a presidential direction under netanyahu.
in the end, his increasingly dismissive style had alienated too many people, especially among nominal allies on the right.
agreement to return to democratic norms may be the underlying glue of the unlikely coalition.
"the parties are disparate, but they share a commitment to reconstitute israel as a functioning liberal democracy," said shlomo avineri, a prominent political scientist.
"in recent years we saw netanyahu begin to govern in a semi-authoritarian way.
"after agreement was reached friday on the government program, bennett said: "the government will work for all the israeli public — religious, secular, ultra-orthodox, arab — without exception, as one.
we will work together, out of partnership and national responsibility, and i believe we will succeed.
"success will require constant compromise.
"they will not deal with the highly contentious issues between left and right," said tamar hermann, a professor of political science at israel's open university.
in practice, that means a likely concentration on domestic rather than foreign affairs.
israel has not had a budget in more than two years of political turmoil and repetitive elections.
bennett, a self-made tech millionaire, is determined to deliver higher standards of living and prosperity to a population weary of such paralysis.
the delicate questions to be deferred or finessed would include any renewed peace negotiations with the palestinians and any major settlement expansion in the west bank.
although bennett was once a leader of the main settler movement in the west bank and has called for the annexation of parts of the territory israel captured in 1967, he seems certain to be constrained by centrist and left-wing members of the coalition and by the pragmatism that survival demands.
establishing good relations with the biden administration, a priority, and improving relations with america's majority liberal jewish community, another significant goal, will also require centrist restraint.
"hard core people of the right, we have the evidence, become more centrist in office," hermann said.
"bennett was not prime minister when he made his pro-settlement statements.
"bennett, 49, like other prominent members of the prospective cabinet, has waited a long time to emerge from netanyahu's shadow.
yair lapid, 57, the incoming foreign minister, and gideon saar, 54, who would become justice minister, are other prominent politicians of a generation weary of being sidelined by the man many israelis had come to dub the king of israel.
they will not want to return to the shadows.
lapid, a leading architect of the coalition, would become prime minister in two years under the deal that made an alternative to netanyahu possible — another incentive for him to help make the government work.
still, it may not.
the parties, ranging from bennett's yamina party on the right to labor and meretz on the left, disagree on everything from lgbtq rights to public transportation on shabbat.
they will come under withering, constant attack from netanyahu's center-right likud party.
it is conceivable that netanyahu will be ousted from likud at some point, whereupon the right-wing members of the coalition may return to their natural alliances.
"it's not going to be easy," said avraham diskin, a political scientist at hebrew university in jerusalem.
"i really doubt that lapid will become prime minister two years from now.
"among measures the prospective government has agreed on is legislation that would set a two-term limit for prime ministers.
in effect, this would preclude netanyahu redux.
four ministries will be shut down, including the digital and strategic affairs ministries.
netanyahu had a cabinet so large and unwieldy he could argue that he had to make decisions himself.
the prospective government will also pursue legislation designed to make it more difficult to change israel's basic laws, which serve as the constitutional foundation of the country in the absence of a constitution.
netanyahu, who had been indicted on fraud and other charges, appeared to seek a curtailing of the powers of the supreme court and immunity from prosecution as prime minister.
the presence of raam, an independent arab party, in government, will impact policy to some degree.
the disparities — in living standards, education and access to land — between israeli jews and the palestinian citizens of israel, who account for about 20% of the population, has become a burning issue.
violent clashes between the communities last month were the worst in two decades.
tensions remain high.
the government looks set to allocate almost $10 billion to close gaps between the communities over the next several years, freeze demolitions of unlicensed homes in arab areas, recognize three bedouin villages in the negev desert, improve public transportation, and increase policing in disadvantaged arab communities suffering from drug dealing and violence.
the posts promised to raam to secure its support include deputy minister in the prime minister's office and chairman of the knesset committee for arab affairs.
but tensions could flare at any moment.
most immediately, a nationalist march through muslim-majority areas of jerusalem's old city has been rescheduled for tuesday.
the original jerusalem day march last month was canceled because of hamas rocket fire and clashes between the police and palestinian protesters.
the issue remains highly sensitive, charged with the same emotions that led to a short war last month, despite efforts to agree on a less sensitive route for the march.
the political adroitness of bennett and lapid will be quickly tested.

singapore – the ministry of health (moh) on saturday (12 june) confirmed 18 new covid-19 cases in singapore, bringing the country's total case count to 62,263. the ministry said in a press release that there are nine new community cases, with four linked to previous cases.
among them, three have already been placed on quarantine, and one was detected through surveillance.
the remaining five cases are currently unlinked.
this updated number of new community cases – the ministry had said there were 12 such cases in the afternoon – is because the moh withdrew three cases after they were verified to be negative for covid-19 upon further tests.
additionally, there are nine imported cases, who have already been placed on stay-home notice upon arrival in singapore.
all nine are returning singaporeans or singapore permanent residents.
the five unlinked cases currently are: an 18-year-old female singaporean who is a student at sim global education, and was last in school on 24 maya 27-year-old myanmar woman who is a foreign domestic worker.

the first case in this cluster is a 38-year-old indonesian man who is employed by marina offshore pte ltd as a sea crew on board tugboat marina ariel.
he was confirmed to have covid-19 infection on 11 june.
the two other cases in this cluster are workplace contacts of this case.
they tested positive while on quarantine and were announced on saturday: a 40-year-old indonesia man who is employed by marina offshore pte ltd as an engineer on board tugboat marina ariela 38-year-old indonesian man who is employed by marina offshore pte ltd as a sea crew on board tugboat marina arielthe other linked cases are: a 35-year-old female malaysia national who works as an administrative staff at ces lamination pte ltdan 82-year-old singaporean woman who regularly helps out at a sundry store at 115 bukit merah view market & hawker centre (fully vaccinated)among the nine imported cases, six are singaporeans and three are singapore permanent residents who returned from india, portugal, russia, thailand, the uk and us.
the ministry noted that the number of new cases in the community has decreased from 129 in the week before to 32 in the past week.
the number of unlinked cases in the community has also decreased from 20 in the week before to 14 in the past week.
singapore currently has 46 active covid-19 clusters.
authorities on thursday said that singapore will gradually move to phase 3 (heightened alert) in two steps, with one set of measures taking effect from 14 june and another from 21 june.
from 14 june, the size of social gatherings allowed in singapore will be increased to five people, up from the current limit of two persons.
dining in at food and beverage establishments, however, can only resume from 21 june provided that the covid-19 situation remains under control.
in addition, work-from-home will remain the default work arrangement in phase 3 (heightened alert).
with 39 more patients discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities on saturday, 61,838 cases – or 99.
3 per cent of the total – have fully recovered from the infection.
most of the 125 hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while one of them is in critical condition in the intensive care unit.
a total of 266 patients – with mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive – are isolated and cared for at community facilities.
apart from the 34 patients who have died from covid-19 complications, 15 others who tested positive for the virus were determined to have died from unrelated causes, including three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and another four, whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease.
among the 87 confirmed cases reported from 6 to 12 june, 46 cases have tested positive for their serology tests, 25 have tested negative, and 16 serology test results are pending.

carbis bay, england: the group of seven richest democracies on saturday (jun 12) sought to counter china's growing influence by offering developing nations an infrastructure plan that would rival president xi jinping's multi-trillion-dollar belt and road initiative.
the g7, whose leaders are meeting in southwestern england and who discussed strategic competition with beijing, has been searching for a coherent response to the growing assertiveness of xi after china's surging economic and military rise over the past 40 years.
us president joe biden and other g7 leaders hope the plan, known as the build back better world (b3w) initiative, will provide a transparent infrastructure partnership to help narrow the us$40 trillion needed by developing nations by 2035, the white house said.
"this is not just about confronting or taking on china," a senior official in biden's administration said.
"but until now we haven't offered a positive alternative that reflects our values, our standards and our way of doing business.
"the g7 and its allies will use the initiative to mobilise private sector capital in areas such as climate, health and health security, digital technology, and gender equity and equality, the white house said.
it was not immediately clear how the plan would exactly work or how much capital it would ultimately allocate.
china's belt and road initiative (bri) is a multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure scheme that xi launched in 2013, involving development and investment initiatives that would stretch from asia to europe and beyond.
more than 100 countries have signed agreements with china to cooperate in bri projects like railways, ports, highways and other infrastructure.
critics say xi's plan to create a modern version of the ancient silk road trade route to link china with asia, europe and beyond is a vehicle for the expansion of communist china.
beijing says such doubts betray the "imperial hangover" of many western powers that humiliated china for centuries.
china's risethe re-emergence of china as a leading global power is considered to be one of the most significant geopolitical events of recent times, alongside the 1991 fall of the soviet union that ended the cold war.
china in 1979 had an economy that was smaller than italy's, but after opening to foreign investment and introducing market reforms, it has become the world's second-largest economy and is a global leader in a range of new technologies.
leaders of the g7 the united states, canada, britain, germany, italy, france and japan want to use their gathering in the seaside resort of carbis bay to show the world that the richest democracies can offer an alternative to china's growing clout.
the us official said that until now, the west had failed to offer a positive alternative to the "lack of transparency, poor environmental and labour standards, and coercive approach" of the chinese government that had left many countries worse off.
according to a refinitiv database, as of mid-last year, more than 2,600 projects at a cost of us$3.
7 trillion were linked to the initiative, although the chinese foreign ministry said last june that about 20 per cent of projects had been seriously affected by the covid-19 pandemic.
as part of the g7 plan, the united states will work with the us congress to supplement existing development financing and to "collectively catalyse hundreds of billions of dollars of infrastructure investment," the white house said.
forced labourthe united states is pushing the other g7 leaders for "concrete action on forced labour" in china, and to include criticism of beijing in their final communique from a three-day summit in southwest england, the us official said.
biden planned to press the other leaders to make clear that they believe forced labour practices are an affront to human dignity and "an egregious example of china's unfair economic competition".
"we're pushing on being specific on areas like xinjiang where forced labour is taking place and where we have to express our values as a g7," the official said of the final communique to be issued at the end of the summit on sunday.
china denies all accusations of abuse in the xinjiang region.
the chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the g7 infrastructure proposal or the us official's remarks about forced labour.

by philip o'connor and jacob gronholt-pedersencopenhagen (reuters) -denmark midfielder christian eriksen was rushed to hospital after collapsing during his side's euro 2020 opening match with finland and being given cpr on the pitch on saturday, with soccer officials later saying the player was stable and awake.
eriksen collapsed suddenly in the 42nd minute of the match while running near the left touchline after a denmark throw-in.
as a hush fell over the 16,000-strong crowd, his teammates gathered around him and one appeared to stick his fingers in eriksen's mouth to clear his airway or check he hadn't swallowed his tongue.
as medics arrived on the scene and pumped eriksen's chest, his teammates formed a ring around him.
danish broadcaster dr cut the live tv feed, instead showing aerial footage of the stadium.
the 29-year-old was taken to the nearby rigshospitalet, where he regained conciousness.
"we have been in contact with him and the players have spoken to christian," said peter moller of the danish football association.
applause broke out in the parken stadium among both danish and finnish fans, when it was announced that eriksen had regained conciousness.
"he is doing well and they are playing the match for christian," moller said.
the game was initially suspended but resumed an hour and 45 minutes later, finland claiming a 1-0 victory when striker joel pohjanpalo headed in on the hour with his side's only attempt of the game.
a visibly drained denmark coach kasper hjulmand said after the match that the players were given the option to finish the game on saturday evening or on sunday.
"it was more manageable to go in again and honestly just get it over with," hjulmand said.
several players, including captain simon kjaer, were too overwhelmed by emotions to finish the game, he said.
"i completely understand that you can't play a soccer match at this level, after watching one of your best friends fight for his life," hjulmand said.
later in the day, belgian striker romelu lukaku, a teammate of eriksen at soccer club inter milan in italy, ran to a tv camera and shouted "chris, chris, i love you" after scoring in his side's opening match against russian.
people gathered outside bars in central copenhagen, many in tears, while eriksen's condition remained unclear.
the crowd at the parken stadium in copenhagen sang the danish national anthem and chanted "christian eriksen" while they waited for news, until word finally came through that the player had regained consciousness.

carbis bay, england: leaders of the world's largest economies unveiled an infrastructure plan saturday (jun 12) for the developing world to compete with china's global initiatives, but they were searching for a consensus on how to forcefully call out beijing over human rights abuses.
citing china for its forced labour practices is part of president joe biden's campaign to persuade fellow democratic leaders to present a more unified front to compete economically with beijing.
but while they agreed to work toward competing against china, there was less unity on how adversarial a public position the group should take.
canada, the united kingdom and france largely endorsed biden's position, while germany, italy and the european union showed more hesitancy during saturday's first session of the group of seven summit, according to two senior biden administration officials.
the officials who briefed reporters were not authorised to publicly discuss the private meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity.
the communique that summarises the meeting's commitments was being written and the contents would not be clear until it was released when the summit ended sunday.
white house officials said late saturday that they believed that china, in some form, could be called out for "nonmarket policies and human rights abuses".
in his first summit as president, biden made a point of carving out one-on-one-time with various leaders, bouncing from french president emmanuel macron to german chancellor angela merkel to italian prime minister mario draghi as well as japan's yoshihide suga and australia's scott morrison, a day after meeting with british prime minister boris johnson as if to personally try to ward off memories of the chaos that his predecessor would often bring to these gatherings.
macron told biden that collaboration was needed on a range of issues and told the american president that "it's great to have a us president part of the club and very willing to cooperate".
relations between the allies had become strained during the four years of donald trump's presidency and his "america first" foreign policy.
merkel, for her part, downplayed differences on china and the nord stream 2 pipeline which would transport natural gas from russia to germany, bypassing ukraine.
"the atmosphere is very cooperative, it is characterised by mutual interest," merkel said.
"there are very good, constructive and very vivid discussions in the sense that one wants to work together.
"white house officials have said biden wants the leaders of the g7 nations — the us, britain, canada, france, germany, japan and italy — to speak in a single voice against forced labour practices targeting china's uyghur muslims and other ethnic minorities.
biden hopes the denunciation will be part of a joint statement to be released sunday when the summit ends, but some european allies are reluctant to split so forcefully with beijing.
china had become one of the more compelling sublots of the wealthy nations' summit, their first since 2019.  last year's gathering was cancelled because of covid-19, and recovery from the pandemic is dominating this year's discussions, with leaders expected to commit to sharing at least 1 billion vaccine shots with struggling countries.
the allies also took the first steps in presenting an infrastructure proposal called "build back better for the world", a name echoing biden's campaign slogan.
the plan calls for spending hundreds of billions of dollars in collaboration with the private sector while adhering to climate standards and labour practices.
it's designed to compete with china's trillion-dollar "belt and road initiative" which has launched a network of projects and maritime lanes that snake around large portions of the world, primarily asia and africa.
critics say china's projects often create massive debt and expose nations to undue influence by beijing.
britain also wants the world's democracies to become less reliant on the asian economic giant.
the uk government said saturday's discussions would tackle "how we can shape the global system to deliver for our people in support of our values", including by diversifying supply chains that currently heavily depend on china.
not every european power has viewed china in as harsh a light as biden, who has painted the rivalry with china as the defining competition for the 21st century.
but there are some signs that europe is willing to impose greater scrutiny.
before biden took office in january, the european commission announced it had come to terms with beijing on a deal meant to provide europe and china with greater access to each other's markets.
the biden administration had hoped to have consultations on the pact.
but the deal has been put on hold, and the european union in march announcedsanctions targeting four chinese officialsinvolved with human rights abuses in xinjiang.
beijing responded with penalties on several members of the european parliament and other europeans critical of the chinese communist party.
biden administration officials see an opportunity to take concrete action to speak out against china's reliance on forced labour as an "affront to human dignity".
while calling out china in the g7 communique would not create any immediate penalties for beijing, one senior administration official said the action would send a message that the leaders were serious about defending human rights and working together to eradicate the use of forced labour.
an estimated 1 million people or more — most of them uyghurs — have been confined in reeducation camps in china's western xinjiang region in recent years, according to researchers.
chinese authorities have been accused of imposing forced labor, systematic forced birth control, torture and separating children from incarcerated parents.
beijing rejects allegations that it is committing crimes.
johnson, the summit host, also welcomed the leaders from "guest nations" south korea, australia and south africa, as well as the head of the united nations, to the summit to "intensify cooperation between the world's democratic and technologically advanced nations".
the leaders planned to attend a barbecue saturday night, complete with toasted marshmallows, hot buttered rum and a performance by a sea shanty troupe.
india was also invited but its delegation is not attending in person because of the severe coronavirus outbreak in the country.
biden ends the trip wednesday by meeting in geneva with russia's vladimir putin.
the white house announced saturday that they will not hold a joint news conference afterward, which removes the opportunity for comparisons to the availability that followed trump and putin's 2018 helsinki summit, in which trump sided with moscow over his own intelligence agencies.
only biden will address the news media after the meeting.
putin, in an interview with nbc news, said the us-russia relationship had "deteriorated to its lowest point in recent years".
he added that while trump was a "talented" and "colourful" person, biden was a "career man" in politics, which has "some advantages, some disadvantages, but there will not be any impulse-based movements" by the us president.

taipei • thailand is prioritising astrazeneca covid-19 vaccines produced in the country for itself due to the severity of the pandemic there, which has delayed deliveries to taiwan, president tsai ing-wen said.
taiwan is dealing with a spike in domestic infections and only 3 per cent of its 23.
5 million people have received at least one shot of vaccination so far, with millions of doses on order that have yet to arrive.
"the problem is that the goods that were supposed to have arrived in june have not," ms tsai told a taiwanese radio station yesterday.
taiwan has ordered 10 million doses from astrazeneca, which is mainly producing the shots in thailand, she said.
"now thailand's epidemic situation is serious and they are giving priority for vaccines to be used in thailand," ms tsai added.
thailand has reported 189,828 infections, with more than 80 per cent of the new cases and fatalities coming since april.
neither astrazeneca nor thai government officials immediately responded to requests for comment.
taiwan's health minister chen shih-chung told lawmakers on tuesday that orders from astrazeneca would be delayed by a month due to production problems at the firm's thai plant.
taiwan received 1.
24 million astrazeneca doses donated by japan last week, and the united states has pledged 750,000 shots, but no details have been provided on that.
ms tsai said the government has been having "emergency" talks with the us and japan to see what other vaccines they may be able to give.
the president has come under pressure to do more to speed up vaccine deliveries, and yesterday expressed apologies for the infections and deaths.
mr chen told parliament that government-run research centre academia sinica has made good progress on mrna technology and contacted moderna about working with it on vaccines.
moderna did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
taiwan has received just 150,000 moderna doses of more than five million on order.

china's quick rollout of a law against foreign sanctions has left european and american companies shocked and facing "irreconcilable" compliance issues, two top business groups said friday, despite beijing saying the move would unlikely impact investment.
the law came into effect on thursday, adding to china's toolbox as it builds its defences against us and eu pressure over trade and human rights.
the move also came just a week after us president joe biden expanded a blacklist of chinese companies in which americans are not allowed to invest -- allowing beijing to now hit back at those who formulate or comply with foreign sanctions.
"european companies in china are shocked by the lack of transparency and speed of this process," european chamber president joerg wuttke told afp, referring to the passing of the new law.
with the fresh rules prohibiting organisations from implementing what beijing deems discriminatory and restrictive measures, "foreign firms remain very much stuck between a rock and a hard place," he said.
american chamber of commerce chairman greg gilligan cautioned that the new law "presents potentially irreconcilable compliance problems for foreign companies".
rushing through a new law without an opportunity for public comment severely jeopardises foreign investor confidence in china's legal system as well, he added.
but chinese foreign ministry spokesman wang wenbin told a regular press briefing on friday he did not see a definite link between the new law and foreign investment.
"if anything, the enactment of the anti-foreign sanctions law provides a predictable legal environment.
.
.
for foreign companies operating in china," he said.
wuttke, however, warned that the action was not conducive to attracting investment, or in reassuring companies that "already feel they may be used as sacrificial pawns in a game of political chess".
"there is a real concern that this will further destabilise eu-china relations," he said.
in the european chamber's latest business confidence survey released this week, 41 per cent of respondents said china's business environment had become more politicised last year.
most reported they expect the situation to remain the same or deteriorate over the coming year.

singapore last year, several countries in south-east asia were among the poster boys for their deft handling of the covid-19 pandemic.
now, they are battling a resurgence in infections.
case numbers are still low compared with other hot spots like india and brazil but governments in the region, nonetheless, have initiated lockdowns and ramped up testing.
they have also accelerated vaccination drives by rolling out public awareness campaigns, ironing out flaws in previous policies, scaling up inoculation efforts and dangling incentives all of which are part of the effort to protect their people and open up economies battered by the pandemic.
"south-east asia has done a wonderful job during the first wave of the pandemic but people later lowered their guard and this gave the virus free rein on the ground.
the governments have tried to ramp up their vaccination campaigns but with the exception of singapore they still have a long way to go," dr abhishek rimal, kuala lumpur-based regional emergency health coordinator at the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies (ifrc), told the straits times.
singapore is the region's leader in vaccinations, with more than 30 per cent of the population fully vaccinated.
it has allowed children from the age of 12 to be vaccinated and month-long restrictions put in place to combat a spike in cases look set to be eased from monday (june 14).
but many of singapore's neighbours are hampered by slow progress in their vaccination campaigns, with most having inoculated less than 10 per cent of their population.
several countries are now working to speed up their efforts.
indonesia, which has given out more than 30 million shots mostly to the elderly, health workers and those with disabilities is allowing old folk to turn up at any designated facility for a jab without prior registration, while offering shots to the young if they help bring in those aged 60 years and above to be inoculated.
indonesia has asked china for technical assistance to help it become a regional production hub for the covid-19 vaccine.

malaysia, which is in the throes of another lockdown after registering record-high cases and deaths in recent weeks, has opened up mega vaccination centres to inoculate up to 8,000 people a day.
vaccine trucks have been deployed to areas where people might find it difficult to get to an immunisation centre.
close to four per cent of malaysia's 32 million population a total of 1.
22 million are now fully vaccinated.
the government has said that 16 million vaccine doses will arrive in the next two months.
thailand has set a target to administer 500,000 shots per day from this month, five times more than the previous daily average.
it has announced plans to open up the tourist resort of phuket next month for fully vaccinated tourists.
the thai government has also allowed private and local administrative organisations to procure covid-19 vaccines, but only through approved agencies such as the national vaccine institute and the thai red cross society.

cambodia has mobilised the army to inoculate its citizens and the one millionth and two millionth vaccinated person received 10 million riel (s$3,244) each.
laos has banned the purchase of covid-19 vaccines by private entities in order to stave off complaints about inequality in the country, while neighbouring vietnam once a model for its successful handling of the pandemic has appealed to the public to donate to a covid-19 vaccine fund as it struggles to contain a new wave of the disease.

the philippines has extended vaccinations to children aged between 12 and 15, while private firms are allowed to procure vaccines for their workers without having to donate part of their shipments to the government.
in order to help shore up confidence in the vaccine programme and tackle the issue of vaccine hesitancy, local celebrities were roped in to get their jabs publicly, while some cities and towns went a step further by offering everything from cattle to land to property in a bid to entice people to get their jabs.

despite their best efforts to bump up vaccinations, countries in the region still face various challenges, chief among them getting enough vaccines.
it is estimated that the region will need some 1.
4 billion doses to cover the entire population of more than 650 million, leading some analysts to caution that this would be a formidable challenge since the global demand for vaccines outstrips supply.
some countries are only receiving their first stocks now.
impoverished timor leste received its first batch of vaccine doses from covax, comprising 24,000 astrazeneca doses, only on april 5 this year.
it received 100,000 doses of sinovac vaccines from china on june 7. covax is the world health organisation-led initiative to secure vaccine supplies for developing countries.
"slow vaccine roll-out will have critical consequences for south-east asia," ms hanh nguyen and mr james borton wrote in the international intelligence publication, geopolitical monitor, on may 25.
"for a region that relies heavily on export and tourism, the low vaccine coverage plus closed border policy mean countries will not open their economies soon, thus missing out on economic opportunities as the west gradually reopens.
"another issue has been competition between the west and china as beijing expands its vaccine diplomacy in the region.
apart from sales, china has donated vaccines to cambodia, laos, myanmar and the philippines.
"as of right now, china stands out in its vaccine diplomacy efforts a move that the global superpower will likely use to solidify its position within the south-east asia," mr shazwan mustafa kamal, a senior associate with political risk and public consultancy vriens & partners, told st. the united states has recently announced plans to donate seven million doses to south asia and south-east asia, while the g-7 is expected to donate one billion vaccine doses to the world's poorest countries.
but mr shazwan said western powers appeared to be playing catch-up to china.
"south-east asian nations will be in an unenviable position in balancing china's overtures as well as their relationships with the us," he added.
dr kevin s. y.  tan, a visiting senior fellow at iseas-yusof ishak institute who has written about vaccination efforts in the region, said it is too early to ascertain whether china's vaccine diplomacy will lead to any significant geopolitical shifts.
"if the pandemic drags on and if other vaccine sources are somehow limited, there will naturally be a greater dependency on chinese vaccines.
such vaccine dependency, in the long run, may bolster china's standing among south-east asian nations," he told st. logistics is another major issue in a region marked by vastly different terrain, from modern cities to rural mountainous areas and far-flung islands.
this comes on top of poor infrastructure and limited resources to distribute and store vaccines, a significant roadblock for rapid deployment, especially for last-mile delivery.
experts fear that if this is not overcome, the overall recovery for any nation will be difficult and time-consuming, especially if coronavirus variants lead to new waves of infection.
as such, it is important that governments ensure the necessary infrastructure is in place, said iseas' dr tan, especially for vaccines with ultra-cold storage requirements.
"but if such infrastructure is unrealistic at the moment, then a decision to use more 'logistically friendly' vaccines may be a pragmatic and feasible approach," said dr tan, who is also an adjunct faculty member at the school of global studies in thailand's thammasat university.
another issue that could hamper the region's success in tamping down the virus is the ongoing civil unrest in myanmar.
political instability in the country has exacerbated an already overstretched healthcare system and observers fear it is in danger of turning into the next covid-19 epicentre.
locals told st the military government has set up vaccination centres but not many people are turning up for the jabs due to high distrust of the military junta's capability to administer, store and transport the vaccines.
many have also refused to get vaccinated as a mark of protest against the junta.
"i am not getting vaccinated as i do not trust the quality and efficacy of the vaccines after the coup.
my friends and family pretty much hold the same view as well," investment analyst ye salween, 31, told st. the jury is still out on whether the region can be fully vaccinated by the end of next year, a target set for the world by british prime minister boris johnson.
ifrc's dr abhishek described it as an "ambitious" target while iseas' dr tan said to do so would require a "colossal effort" which can be achieved, but only with support from foreign countries.
"this is because not a single country in the region has come up with its own home-made vaccine against covid-19 so far.
as a region, we are still dependent on supplies and support from sources beyond south-east asia and this is a glaring vulnerability that may need to be addressed," said dr tan.
professor paul tambyah, president of the asia-pacific society of clinical microbiology and infection, said locally manufactured vaccines were "the obvious answer", noting that middle-income countries such as indonesia, thailand and malaysia had well established vaccine-manufacturing capacity.
"the key has to be the trips waiver," he told st, referring to the world trade organisation's (wto) agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights that governs the transfer of property like movie rights or vaccine-manufacturing specifics.
"with the trips waiver on patents, south-east asian countries could rapidly scale up vaccine production.
"he added that, without the constraints of the patents, mass vaccination could be rolled out very quickly the way measles and polio vaccines, which were locally made, led to the virtual elimination of these diseases.
as of now though, reports say malaysia and the philippines will experience delays in the delivery of the astrazeneca vaccine manufactured in thailand.
that is going to exacerbate the situation in the philippines, in particular, because some vaccination sites in the capital, manila, have been closed due to the shortage of vaccines.
mr jose ma luis montesclaros, an associate research fellow at the s.  rajaratnam school of international studies, has suggested that asean should support the private sector to develop vaccine production capacity.
"i feel that expanding the supplies of vaccines is something that benefits not only the vaccine- producing/recipient countries, but the world over, given the interconnected nature of global trade and investments," he told st. "the sooner countries are able to solve the health problem, the sooner they can begin working on economic recovery," he added.

new york (bloomberg) a malaysian financier and a former member of hiphop trio the fugees were accused in a new indictment of illegally lobbying the trump administration to drop an investigation tied to the 1mdb global bribery scandal and remove a chinese dissident from the us.
a federal grand jury on thursday returned a superseding indictment against low taek jho, also known as jho low, and prakazrel "pras" michel, according to a justice department statement on friday (june 11).
low and michel's aim was to influence then-president donald trump's justice department to abandon the probe of low and others and extradite a wealthy chinese exile who has criticised the government in beijing.
that exile has not been identified by the justice department, but a person familiar with the matter has said it is guo wengui.
both low and michel were charged with money-laundering conspiracy, while michel was also accused of witness tampering and conspiring to make false statements to banks.
"pras intends to defend this case very vigorously and believes that when all of the facts are developed, a jury will conclude that this was a selective prosecution that has unfairly targeted mr michel and will exonerate him," michel's lawyer, benjamin brafman, said in a statement.
with lauryn hill and wyclef jean, michel was a member of the fugees, which had some of the biggest hits of the 1990s.
low and michel were previously charged in 2019 with seeking to funnel millions of dollars of low's money into the us presidential election as legitimate campaign contributions while hiding the actual source of the funds.
prosecutors said the two men worked closely with trump fund-raiser elliott broidy, who pleaded guilty last year to illegally lobbying the trump administration to help low squelch the 1mdb investigation and to seek the extradition of wengui from the us trump pardoned broidy in january.

the hong kong government on friday enacted new guidelines that allow authorities to censor films on the basis of safeguarding national security, escalating concerns over freedoms in the former british colony.
the government said the changes that give the film censor authority to ban films perceived as promoting or glorifying acts or activities that could endanger national security take effect from friday.
the film censorship authority should stay "vigilant to the portrayal, depiction or treatment of any act or activity which may amount to an offence endangering national security", the government said in a statement.
"any content of a film which is objectively and reasonably capable of being perceived as endorsing, supporting, promoting, such act or activity" will be censored, according to the guideline.
[[nid:522086]]beijing imposed a national security law on hong kong in june that punishes what authorities broadly define as secession, sedition and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail, following a year of sometimes violent pro-democracy demonstrations.
western governments and international human rights groups have expressed concern the security law will crush freedoms in hong kong.
a filmmaker surnamed tang said the amendment would legitimise a crackdown on protest-related films and create a chilling effect on the movie industry.
"movies on social issues will be banned.
it will silence the filmmakers," tang said.

st blazey, england (reuters) britain's queen elizabeth met us president joe biden under the canopy of the world's largest indoor rainforest on friday (june 11) as she hosted a reception for leaders of the group of seven (g-7) richest nations, who are holding a three-day summit.
the 95-year-old monarch was joined by the other senior members of the british royal family, with son and heir prince charles and his wife camilla and grandson prince william and his wife kate also present.
it was their first major public event together since the funeral in april of prince philip, the queen's husband of more than seven decades.
at the reception, held at the eden project, whose distinctive bubble-like biomes house thousands of plant varieties, the queen met biden as us president for the first time.
he is 13th american leader she has met during her record-breaking 69-year reign.
"joe and i are both looking forward to meeting the queen," biden's wife jill, who joined him at the eden project event, had said on thursday.
"that's an exciting part of the visit for us.
"they are also due to have tea with the monarch at windsor castle on sunday after the summit has concluded.
following a photocall with the queen, prince charles addressed the g-7 leaders about his sustainable markets initiative, which aims to involve business and private sector investment in government efforts to combat climate change.
"the fight against this terrible pandemic provides, if ever one was needed, a crystal-clear example of the scale, and sheer speed, at which the global community can tackle crises when we combine political will with business ingenuity and public mobilization," the prince told them.
"ladies and gentlemen, we are doing it for the pandemic.
so if you don't mind me saying so, we must also do it for the planet," said charles, 72, who has spent much of his life campaigning on environmental issues.

keep up to speed at a glance with the top 10 daily storieskeep up to speed at a glance with the top 10 daily storiescarbis bay, england (ap) — leaders of the world's largest economies unveiled an infrastructure plan saturday for the developing world to compete with china's global initiatives, but they were searching for a consensus on how to forcefully to call out beijing over human rights abuses.
citing china for its forced labor practices is part of president joe biden's campaign to persuade fellow democratic leaders to present a more unified front to compete economically with beijing.
but while they agreed to work toward competing against china, there was less unity on how adversarial a public position the group should take.
canada, the united kingdom and france largely endorsed biden's position, while germany, italy and the european union showed more hesitancy during saturday's first session of the group of seven summit, according to two senior biden administration officials.
the officials who briefed reporters were not authorized to publicly discuss the private meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity.
the communique that summarizes the meeting's commitments was being written and the contents would not be clear until it was released when the summit ended sunday.
white house officials said late saturday that they believed that china, in some form, could be called out for "nonmarket policies and human rights abuses.
"in his first summit as president, biden made a point of carving out one-on-one-time with various leaders, bouncing from french president emmanuel macron to german chancellor angela merkel to italian prime minister mario draghi as well as japan's yoshihide suga and australia's scott morrison, a day after meeting with british prime minister boris johnson as if to personally try to ward off memories of the chaos that his predecessor would often bring to these gatherings.
macron told biden that collaboration was needed on a range of issues and told the american president that "it's great to have a u. s.  president part of the club and very willing to cooperate. "
relations between the allies had become strained during the four years of donald trump's presidency and his "america first" foreign policy.
merkel, for her part, downplayed differences on china and the nord stream 2 pipeline which would transport natural gas from russia to germany, bypassing ukraine.
"the atmosphere is very cooperative, it is characterized by mutual interest," merkel said.
"there are very good, constructive and very vivid discussions in the sense that one wants to work together.
"white house officials have said biden wants the leaders of the g-7 nations — the u. s. , britain, canada, france, germany, japan and italy — to speak in a single voice against forced labor practices targeting china's uyghur muslims and other ethnic minorities.
biden hopes the denunciation will be part of a joint statement to be released sunday when the summit ends, but some european allies are reluctant to split so forcefully with beijing.
china had become one of the more compelling sublots of the wealthy nations' summit, their first since 2019.  last year's gathering was canceled because of covid-19, and recovery from the pandemic is dominating this year's discussions, with leaders expected to commit to sharing at least 1 billion vaccine shots with struggling countries.
the allies also took the first steps in presenting an infrastructure proposal called "build back better for the world," a name echoing biden's campaign slogan.
the plan calls for spending hundreds of billions of dollars in collaboration with the private sector while adhering to climate standards and labor practices.
it's designed to compete with china's trillion-dollar "belt and road initiative," which has launched a network of projects and maritime lanes that snake around large portions of the world, primarily asia and africa.
critics say china's projects often create massive debt and expose nations to undue influence by beijing.
britain also wants the world's democracies to become less reliant on the asian economic giant.
the u. k.  government said saturday's discussions would tackle "how we can shape the global system to deliver for our people in support of our values," including by diversifying supply chains that currently heavily depend on china.
not every european power has viewed china in as harsh a light as biden, who has painted the rivalry with china as the defining competition for the 21st century.
but there are some signs that europe is willing to impose greater scrutiny.
before biden took office in january, the european commission announced it had come to terms with beijing on a deal meant to provide europe and china with greater access to each other's markets.
the biden administration had hoped to have consultations on the pact.
but the deal has been put on hold, and the european union in march announced sanctions targeting four chinese officials involved with human rights abuses in xinjiang.
beijing responded with penalties on several members of the european parliament and other europeans critical of the chinese communist party.
biden administration officials see an opportunity to take concrete action to speak out against china's reliance on forced labor as an "affront to human dignity.
"while calling out china in the g-7 communique would not create any immediate penalties for beijing, one senior administration official said the action would send a message that the leaders were serious about defending human rights and working together to eradicate the use of forced labor.
an estimated 1 million people or more — most of them uyghurs — have been confined in reeducation camps in china's western xinjiang region in recent years, according to researchers.
chinese authorities have been accused of imposing forced labor, systematic forced birth control, torture and separating children from incarcerated parents.
beijing rejects allegations that it is committing crimes.
johnson, the summit host, also welcomed the leaders from "guest nations" south korea, australia and south africa, as well as the head of the united nations, to the summit to "intensify cooperation between the world's democratic and technologically advanced nations.
"the leaders planned to attend a barbecue saturday night, complete with toasted marshmallows, hot buttered rum and a performance by a sea shanty troupe.
india was also invited but its delegation is not attending in person because of the severe coronavirus outbreak in the country.
biden ends the trip wednesday by meeting in geneva with russia's vladimir putin.
the white house announced saturday that they will not hold a joint news conference afterward, which removes the opportunity for comparisons to the availability that followed trump and putin's 2018 helsinki summit, in which trump sided with moscow over his own intelligence agencies.
only biden will address the news media after the meeting.
putin, in an interview with nbc news, said the u. s. -russia relationship had "deteriorated to its lowest point in recent years.
"he added that while trump was a "talented" and "colorful" person, biden was a "career man" in politics, which has "some advantages, some disadvantages, but there will not be any impulse-based movements" by the u. s.  president.

china's quick rollout of a law against foreign sanctions has left european and american companies shocked and facing "irreconcilable" compliance issues, two top business groups said friday, despite beijing saying the move would unlikely impact investment.

euro 2020 was still reeling sunday after denmark midfielder christian eriksen collapsed and had to be revived by medics on the pitch during his country's defeat to finland.
italy got their euro 2020 campaign off the mark with an impressive 3-0 win over turkey in the curtain-raiser for the postponed continental tournament in front of their home fans in rome on friday.
playing their first major tournament in five years after failing to qualify for the 2018 world cup, all the goals came in the second half in front of a stadio olimpico that was filled to a quarter of its capacity.
merih demiral's own goal put italy ahead before ciro immobile and lorenzo insigne netted for roberto mancini's side in the group a opener.
the win capped an emotional night in the italian capital which saw 16,000 fans return to the stadio olimpico.
"it was important to start well in rome and i think it's a satisfaction for the public and for italians," said mancini, whose side are now on a 28-match unbeaten run.
"there was a lot of help from the crowd.
it was a beautiful evening, i hope there are many others, but there are still six more for wembley.
""we were hoping for another result, but italy was dominant," said turkey coach senol gunes.
"the first goal changed things in the second half and we lost control of the game.
"there was a party atmosphere, with a spectacular sound and light show and firework display before kick-off for the opening of the month-long 24-team event, which will be played across 11 countries.
there was a performance by the italian national police orchestra, a parade of huge inflatable balloons on the pitch, tenor andrea bocelli sang 'nessun dorma' before a virtual performance from martin garrix, bono and the edge.
former italy world cup winners alessandro nesta and francesco totti, who played for lazio and roma during their careers at the stadio olimpico, carried the ball to the centre of the pitch before kick-off.
berardi impresses -on the pitch, italy dominated early on with a three-man attack led by immobile, who plays for lazio.
the 31-year-old had several near misses in the first half, coming up against a solid turkey defence who held their own.
turkey could also thank goalkeeper ugurcan cakir for pulling off a big save on 23 minutes, tipping over italy captain giorgio chiellini's powerful goal-bound header off an insigne corner.
italy finally got on the scoreboard eight minutes after the break when the unfortunate demiral found himself in the path of a federico berardi cross for immobile, the juventus defender bundling the ball into his own net.
leonardo spinazzola had a chance for a second minutes later, with immobile sending the rebound wide.
immobile finally got his goal, his 14th for italy, and first in a major tournament, in the 66th minute, scoring from a rebound after cakir had saved from spinazzola.
and insigne curled in the third with 11 minutes to go.
sassuolo winger berardi had a role in all three goals, with italy scoring three for the first time in a european championship match.
all three italy forwards proved efficient on the night with a defence organised around juventus veterans chiellini and leonardo bonucci holding firm, securing a ninth straight clean sheet.
"we struggled at the start, we tried to accelerate but we hit a wall," said immobile.
"in the second half, they were a little more tired, they tried to rush us but the spaces opened up, and we saw our quality at that time.
"gianluigi donnarumma was largely unworried in the italy goal apart from a dangerous burak yilmaz cross after half an hour and a solo run by cengiz under after coming off the bench after the break.
"from a tactical point of view, italy was superior," said gunes.
"italy mastered the pitch and the ball.
they suffocated us with pressing and high pace, and they took advantage of playing at home.
"we have to react now.
"italy, looking for a second european title after 1968, next play switzerland in rome on wednesday, with 2008 semi-finalists turkey taking on wales in baku.

carbis bay, england: china on sunday (jun 13) pointedly cautioned group of seven leaders that the days when "small" groups of countries decided the fate of the world was long gone, hitting back at the world's richest democracies which have sought a unified position over beijing.
"the days when global decisions were dictated by a small group of countries are long gone," a spokesman for the chinese embassy in london said.
"we always believe that countries, big or small, strong or weak, poor or rich, are equals, and that world affairs should be handled through consultation by all countries.
"the re-emergence of china as a leading global power is considered to be one of the most significant geopolitical events of recent times, alongside the 1991 fall of the soviet union that ended the cold war.
the g7, whose leaders are meeting in southwestern england, has been searching for a coherent response to the growing assertiveness of president xi jinping after china's spectacular economic and military rise over the past 40 years.
leaders of the group the united states, canada, britain, germany, italy, france and japan want to use their gathering in the english seaside resort of carbis bay to show the world that the richest democracies can offer an alternative to china's growing clout.
canadian prime minister justin trudeau led a g7 discussion of china on saturday and called on leaders to come up with a unified approach to the challenges posed by the people's republic, a source said.
the g7 are planning to offer developing nations an infrastructure scheme that could rival xi's multi-trillion-dollar belt and road initiative.

advertisementby marc santoramore than two centuries after his ancestor was cast out of cornwall for stealing and sent to australia with hundreds of other convicts, scott morrison returned to the area on friday as prime minister of australia.
"it's a long time since one of my family was in cornwall," mr.  morrison said in a speech in perth on wednesday before traveling to meet with other world leaders at the group of 7 conference.
while the issues of the day were at the center of his agenda as an invited guest at the summit, it was also an unusual homecoming of sorts.
the main location of the gathering, carbis bay, is about 60 miles from the market in launceston where his ancestor, william roberts, stole "five pound and a half-weight of yarn" in 1786, according to the australian associated press.
mr.  morrison said mr.  roberts was his "fifth great-grandfather.
""he stole some yarn in cornwall, and the rest is history," mr.  morrison said.
"more than 200 years of it, so it'll be interesting to be going back there.
"mr.  roberts was part of a group of over 1,400 people who set sail in 11 ships from portsmouth, england on may 13, 1787 — part of the infamous "first fleet" — transporting military leaders, sailors and convicts across the world.
"a wide variety of people made up this legendary 'first fleet,'" according to the national geographic society.
"military and government officials, along with their wives and children, led the group.
sailors, cooks, masons and other workers hoped to establish new lives in the new colony.
"the first fleet included more than 700 convicts — the start of what would be more than 80 years of britain's shipping off convicts to serve out their sentences in new south wales, now a state in southeastern australia.
britain sent more than 160,000 convicts to australia in that time, and it is estimated that about 20 percent of present-day australians can trace their ancestry to them.
mr.  morrison is not the first australian leader to trace his roots back to a convict.
genealogists traced former prime minister kevin rudd's family line to an english woman who barely escaped the hangman's noose.
in 1788, mary wade — mr.  rudd's paternal fifth-great-grandmother — was convicted at the old bailey in london of having robbed an 8-year-old girl of her dress and underwear in a bathroom.
ms.  wade is said to have declared at her trial: "i was in a good mind to have chucked her down" the toilet.
"i wish i had done so.
"she was sentenced "to be hanged by the neck til she be dead," but her sentence was commuted and she was shipped off to australia.

by yew lun tianbeijing (reuters) china passed a wide-ranging law to counter foreign sanctions on thursday, in an apparent move to legalise its tit-for-tat retaliation against punitive actions taken by foreign countries over issues from human rights to hong kong.
the law, effective immediately, builds upon previous administrative counter-measures against foreign sanctions issued by the chinese foreign and commerce ministries.
it also lays out the scope of china's counter-sanctions.
who's the target?individuals or entities involved in the making or implementation of discriminatory measures against chinese citizens, or interfering with china's internal affairs could be put onto a blacklist, according to the full text of the law published on thursday.
blacklisted individuals could find their relatives, and the organisations of which they are senior managers or have control over placed on the list.
"relevant departments" in the chinese government can decide who to put on or remove from the blacklist.
what happens to those blacklisted?those blacklisted could be denied entry into china or deported from china.
their assets within china can be sealed, seized or frozen.
entities within china could be restricted from engaging in all forms of transactions or cooperation or other activities, potentially limiting the investment activities of blacklisted entities in china.
chinese citizens or organisations can sue in chinese courts those who enforce foreign measures that discriminate against them.
how is this different from the past?while the foreign ministry has previously announced sanctions mainly against individuals including western politicians and scholars, it had not cited a specific law as the legal basis.
it was also not always clear what those sanctions entailed.
although the commerce ministry has announced mechanisms targeted at foreign entities such as a so-called "unreliable entity list", there have been no known instances of companies being put on the list.
the new law combines many features of these administrative orders by the foreign and commerce ministries, such as allowing chinese companies to sue for compensation and denying entry to blacklisted persons.
beijing analysts say the new law makes china's sanctions appear less random, as it spells out who can be blacklisted and what the sanctions would entail.
what do supporters say?state media and experts in china said the new law was a long overdue "legal weapon" needed to deter the west from interfering in china's internal affairs.
all 14 vice-chairpersons of china's legislature who passed the law have been under u. s.  sanctions for passing the national security law last year that critics say has crippled political freedoms in hong kong.
in other measures, the united states issued a ban on cotton and tomato imports from china's western xinjiang region in january, citing human rights violations and the use of forced labour in the region.
wang jiangyu, a law professor at city university of hong kong, said the european union has a law the "blocking statute" to counter u. s.  sanctions, so china should not be faulted for having a similar law.
"the new law is the stick part of the carrot and stick diplomacy.
but it is defensive in nature, not offensive, and will only be used when other countries apply sanctions on us first," said cheng xiaohe, an associate professor of international studies at the renmin university of china.
what do critics say?foreign companies increasingly fear they will be used as sacrificial pawns in a game of political chess, said joerg wuttke, president of european union chamber of commerce.
chinese experts say the law could dampen the climate for foreign investment, but that the chinese government would have calculated this is a price worth paying to safeguard the country's interests.
(reporting by yew lun tian; editing by frances kerry)china's quick rollout of a law against foreign sanctions has left european and american companies shocked and facing "irreconcilable" compliance issues, two top business groups said friday, despite beijing saying the move would unlikely impact investment.

carbis bay (britain) • leaders of the group of seven rich nations yesterday adopted a rival plan to oppose china's belt and road initiative (bri) by helping build infrastructure in poorer nations in a "values-driven, high-standard and transparent" partnership.
the adoption of the united states-inspired "build back better world" (b3w) project came after us president joe biden and other g-7 leaders met to address "strategic competition with china and commit to concrete actions to help meet the tremendous infrastructure need in low-and middle-income countries", the white house said.
china has been widely criticised for saddling small countries with unmanageable debt as part of its trillion-dollar belt and road initiative, which has seen money lent for projects stretching across asia, africa, latin america and even europe.
president xi jinping launched the bri in 2013 to significantly expand china's economic and political influence, with many of the infrastructure plans seen as helping to deliver its goods globally.
china denies any ulterior motives in the vast investment project.
but critics argue it uses the financial leverage arising from the scheme to boost its clout, in what they dub "debt-trap diplomacy".
the white house said the g-7 initiative would be similarly global in scope, estimating that the developing world needs more than us$40 trillion (s$53 trillion) in infrastructure, a gap "which has been exacerbated by the covid-19 pandemic".
"b3w will collectively catalyse hundreds of billions of dollars of infrastructure investment for low-and middle-income countries in the coming years," it said.
funding will emphasise the environment and climate, labour safeguards, transparency and anti-corruption, it added, in implicit contrast with china's opaque funding.
further details would come in the g-7 summit's final communique today, the white house added.
the rival plan comes after the us and china clashed in rare talks on friday, with mr biden's administration pressing beijing on covid-19, taiwan and human rights.
in a telephone call with china's top diplomat yang jiechi, us secretary of state antony blinken renewed us pressure on china over the origins of the pandemic that has killed more than 3.
7 million people.
he "stressed the importance of cooperation and transparency regarding the origin of the virus", including allowing world health organisation experts back into china, state department spokesman ned price said in a statement.
mr biden has ordered us intelligence to report back by late august on whether the sars-cov-2 virus that causes covid-19, which was first detected in late 2019 in the chinese city of wuhan, emerged from an animal source or a laboratory accident.
b3w will collectively catalyse hundreds of billions of dollars of infrastructure investment for low-and middle-income countries in the coming years.
mr yang told mr blinken that the laboratory theory was "absurd", according to the state-run china global television network.
"we urge the us side to respect facts and science, not to politicise the origin tracing and to focus its attention on international cooperation on the fight against the pandemic," mr yang said.
according to china central television, mr yang told mr blinken: "genuine multilateralism is not pseudo-multilateralism based on the interests of small circles.
"the leaders of g-7 nations britain, canada, france, germany, italy, japan and the us are largely focused on "building back better" after covid-19 wrecked economies and claimed millions of lives around the world.
they were set yesterday to outline a joint declaration aimed at preventing another pandemic, as part of their wide-ranging talks on the second day of the summit in britain.
the leaders are also set to issue new commitments on climate change, including financial aid for the developing world.
the agenda broadened yesterday to foreign policy issues, as they were joined by the leaders of australia, south africa and south korea, with india taking part remotely.
mr biden was expected to seek to address frayed relations with moscow, in particular over its cyber activity.

carbis bay, britain (afp) leaders of the group of seven (g-7) rich nations were set on saturday (june 12) to agree on a joint declaration aimed at preventing another pandemic, as they resume wide-ranging talks at their first in-person summit in almost two years.
the "carbis bay declaration" – named after the seaside town in cornwall, south-west england, where united states president joe biden and other leaders are meeting this weekend – comprises a series of health policy commitments.
the collective steps include slashing the time taken to develop and license vaccines, treatments and diagnostics for any future disease to under 100 days, while reinforcing global surveillance networks.
it will be formally published on sunday (june 13), alongside the g-7's final communique.
"the #carbisbaydeclaration marks a proud and historic moment for us all," british prime minister boris johnson said on twitter, as he chaired the second day of the three-day summit.
"under this agreement, the world's leading democracies will commit to preventing a global pandemic from ever happening again, ensuring the devastation caused by covid-19 is never repeated," he said.
world health organisation chief tedros adhanom ghebreyesus, criticised in some quarters for being too accommodating towards china where the coronavirus was first detected, welcomed the health pact.
he also said the united nations agency would examine a british proposal to create a "global pandemic radar" to send early warnings of future outbreaks.
"the world needs a stronger global surveillance system to detect new epidemic and pandemic risks," dr tedros said.
however, aid charity oxfam said the declaration "does nothing to address the fundamental problems that are preventing vaccines being accessible to the vast majority of humanity".

the g-7 – britain, canada, france, germany, italy, japan and the united states – are largely focussed on "building back better" after covid-19 wrecked economies and claimed millions of lives around the world.
they are expected to pledge to donate one billion vaccine doses to poor countries this year and next – although campaigners say the rollout is much too slow to end the crisis sooner.
the leaders are also set to issue new commitments on climate change, including financial aid for the developing world, in the buildup to the un's cop26 environmental summit in scotland in november.

the agenda broadened on saturday to foreign policy issues, as the g-7 was joined by the leaders of australia, south africa and south korea, with india taking part remotely.
president biden is expected to press allies to bolster cooperation in dealing with a resurgent china, from offering an alternative to its trillion-dollar "belt and road" infrastructure initiative to confronting its alleged forced labour practices including against the muslim uighur minority in xinjiang region.
"this is not just about confronting or taking on china," a senior white house official said.
"this is about providing an affirmative, positive alternative vision for the world.
"he said mr biden would be urging "concrete action" on the forced labour accusations, calling them "an affront to human dignity, and an egregious example of china's unfair economic competition".
china denies allegations that it is waging "genocide" by forcing uighurs and people from other ethnic-turkic minorities into internment camps in xinjiang.
the us president will also seek to address frayed relations with moscow, in particular over its cyber activity.
most of the g-7 leaders will reconvene on monday in brussels for a nato meeting, before mr biden heads on to his first summit with russian president vladimir putin in geneva, vowing to deliver a blunt message about russian behaviour.
in a rare interview with us media released on friday, mr putin voiced hope that mr biden would be less impetuous than former us president donald trump, who infamously sided with the russian leader against the views of his own intelligence chiefs.
"it is my great hope that, yes, there are some advantages, some disadvantages, but there will not be any impulse-based movements on behalf of the sitting us president," mr putin told nbc news.
closer to home for the g-7 hosts, mr johnson came under concerted pressure in separate meetings with the leaders of france, germany and the european union to respect his brexit commitments over northern ireland.
"the prime minister expressed confidence in the uk's position in the northern ireland protocol," a defiant downing street responded, referring to special brexit arrangements for the restive province.
"he made clear his desire for pragmatism and compromise on all sides but underlined that protecting the belfast good friday (peace) agreement in all its dimensions was paramount.

jerusalem (afp) israeli lawmakers are to vote on sunday (june 13) on a change to the coalition government of bitter ideological rivals united by their determination to banish prime minister benjamin netanyahu from power.
the crunch knesset vote will either terminate the hawkish premier's uninterrupted 12-year tenure or return israel to a stalemate likely to trigger a fifth general election since 2019. mr netanyahu, who is battling a clutch of corruption charges in an ongoing trial he dismisses as a conspiracy, has pushed israeli politics firmly to the right over the years.
on saturday night, around 2,000 protesters rallied outside the 71-year-old's official residence to celebrate what they believe will be his departure from office.
"for us, this is a big night and tomorrow will be even a bigger day.
i am almost crying.
we fought peacefully for this (mr netanyahu's departure) and the day has come," said protester ofir robinski.
a fragile eight-party alliance, ranging from the right-wing jewish nationalist yamina party to arab lawmakers, was early this month cobbled together by centrist politician yair lapid.
last friday, all coalition agreements had been signed and submitted to the knesset secretariat, the yamina party announced, a moment that party leader naftali bennett said brought "to an end two and a half years of political crisis".
but the ever-combative mr netanyahu has tried to peel off defectors that would deprive the nascent coalition of its wafer-thin legislative majority.
if the new government is confirmed, mr bennett, a former defence minister, would serve as premier for two years.
coalition architect mr lapid, who heads the yesh atid party and is a former television presenter, would then take the helm.
the anti-netanyahu bloc spans the political spectrum, including three right-wing, two centrist and two left-wing parties, along with an arab islamic conservative party.
the improbable alliance emerged two weeks after an 11-day war between israel and hamas, the islamist group that rules the palestinian enclave of gaza and following inter-communal violence in israeli cities with significant arab populations.
"we will work together, out of partnership and national responsibility and i believe we will succeed," mr bennett said last friday.
sunday's crucial knesset session is due to open at 4pm local time (9pm singapore time), with mr bennett, mr lapid and mr netanyahu all set to speak before the vote.
mr netanyahu has heaped pressure on his former right-wing allies to defect from the fledgling coalition while attacking the legitimacy of the bennett-lapid partnership.
he has accused mr bennett of "fraud" for siding with rivals and angry rallies by the premier's likud party supporters have resulted in security being bolstered for some lawmakers.
mr netanyahu's bombastic remarks as he sees his grip on power slip have drawn parallels at home and abroad to former united states president donald trump, who described his election loss last year as the result of a rigged vote.
the prime minister has called the prospective coalition "the greatest election fraud in the history" of israel.
his likud party said the accusations refer to mr bennett entering a coalition that "doesn't reflect the will of the voters".
sunday's vote arrives hot on the heels of police crackdowns on palestinian protests over the threatened eviction of families from homes in israeli-annexed east jerusalem to make way for jewish settlers, a month after similar clashes fuelled the latest war between israel and hamas.
it also comes amid right-wing anger over the postponement of a controversial jewish nationalist march.
mr netanyahu favoured finding a way to allow the so-called "march of the flags", originally scheduled to take place last thursday, to proceed as planned.
he took that position despite the original route envisaging the march unfolding close to flashpoint areas including the al-aqsa mosque compound, where clashes last month triggered the gaza conflict.
the premier's insistence saw his opponents accuse him and his allies of stoking tensions to cling onto power via a "scorched earth" campaign.
if mr netanyahu loses the premiership, he will not be able to push through changes to basic laws that could give him immunity in regard to his corruption trial.
the controversial flag march is now slated for tuesday and ongoing tensions surrounding it could represent a key initial test for any approved coalition.

an incursion by chinese aircraft into malaysian airspace is yet another reminder of beijing's belligerence, says this observernew south wales: earlier this month, 16 chinese military transport aircraft weresighted a little more than 100kmoff the coast of the east malaysian state of sarawak.
the royal malaysian air force called it "a serious threat to national sovereignty".
the ministry of foreign affairs summoned china's ambassador to malaysia to voice its displeasure over the incursion into malaysian airspace.
however, china's foreign ministry spokesperson dismissed malaysian concerns by claiming that the aircraft were there for "routine flight exercises".
malaysia is not alone in being wary of chinese intentions in the region.
china's infamous "nine-dash line" around the south china sea and unilateral claims to as much as 80 per cent of the disputed waters, along with the construction of artificial islands, has caused much consternation.
regular incursions by chinese fishing trawlers have occurred in indonesian, vietnamese and filipino waters, and the belligerence displayed by chinese naval vessels and aircraft has further fuelled suspicions.
southeast asian leaders must balance economic realities with defending territorial sovereignty and national pride.
the incursion by chinese aircraft into malaysian airspace comes barely two months after a controversial remark by the malaysian foreign affairs minister hishammuddin hussein during a visit to fujian province in southern china on apr 1. hishammuddin told his chinese counterpart wang yi that "you will always be my elder brother".
prominent malaysian opposition leader anwar ibrahim lamented that "this is not the language and style that should be used in the diplomatic world and international relations, as it seemingly implies malaysia is a puppet to a foreign power".
anwar urged hishammuddin to retract his comment and apologise to malaysians.
hishammuddin later clarified that his remark was meant to show his respect to wang, who is an older person and a very senior diplomat.
china as a superpowerhishammudin should have been more cautious with his language.
his remarks offer a further warning of the potential cost to southeast asian leaders of being seen to defer to china's sphere of influence.
beijing has calculated that as china gained stature as a superpower southeast asian nations would not, and could not, challenge its economic and military might.
this was underscored after president xi jinping announced in 2015 that china had no intention of militarising the south china sea, only to then proceeded to build more artificial islands and install missiles and erect buildings and military bases on those islands.
the risk for hishammudin was to again reinforce this lesson.
it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
southeast asian countries, including malaysia, recognise that none of them has the capability to match china's military might.
and the region does indeed have deep ties with china economically, which beijing is eager to grow.
construction of a high-speed railway service linking kunming in yunnan province with singapore as part of the belt and road initiative (bri) remains a top priority for china.
however, southeast asian leaders must balance economic realities with defending territorial sovereignty and national pride.
china has been actively cultivating malaysia through the funding and construction of massive infrastructure projects.
in 2016, the east coast rail link (ecrl) costing 65.
5 billion ringgit (us$15.
8 billion) was launched to link kuantan on the eastern coast with ports in the western coast.
the melaka gateway, a us$10.
5 billion commercial and property development project, was awarded to a malaysian company that included three chinese commercial partners.
three pipelines were also awarded to chinese companies at a cost of us$4.
1 billion.
tight economic tiesmalaysia was right to be disappointed at china's action to send military planes close to its borders.
yet after the ruling barisan nasional was voted out of office in 2018, the incoming prime minister mahathir mohamed proceeded to review these projects.
in a visit to beijing in august 2018, he warned about the "new version of colonialism" where rich countries preyed on poorer ones in what was taken to be a swipe to china.
the three planned pipelines were scrapped a month later.
mahathir renegotiated terms for the ecrl and reduced the cost to 44 billion ringgit in 2019. with the collapse of the mahathir government in february 2020, prime minister muhyiddin yassin proceeded to mend ties with china.
in april this year, it was announced that the renegotiated ecrl would cost 50 billion ringgit.
however, the malacca state government cancelled the melaka gateway project in november 2020 on the basis that there had been "no development".
malaysia's experience in an example of how china influence is conditioning behaviour in southeast asia.
in 2019, nikkei asia reported that the 10-member association of southeast asian nations had overtaken the united states as the second-largest trading partner for china.
chinese investments also flow into southeast asia, largely through the bri, the global times reporting in november 2020 that china's investment in southeast asia was more than 76 per cent of the total investment in countries and regions linked with the bri.
but none of this should be cause for southeast asian leaders to surrender sovereign interests to a bully in beijing.
malaysia was right to be disappointed at china's action to send military planes close to its borders.
malaysia should take a lesson of its own, that china has a "new version of colonialism".
responding collectively as a region should be the priority.

hong kong • the top us diplomat in hong kong said the imposition of a new national security law had created an "atmosphere of coercion" that threatens both the city's freedoms and its standing as an international business hub.
in unusually strident remarks to reuters this week, us consul-general hanscom smith called it "appalling" that beijing's influence had "vilified" routine diplomatic activities such as meeting local activists, part of a government crackdown on foreign forces that was "casting a pall over the city".
critics of the legislation say the law has crushed the city's democratic opposition, civil society and western-style freedoms.
the foreign forces issue is at the heart of the crimes of "collusion" with foreign countries or "external elements" detailed in article 29 of the security law, scholars say.
article 29 outlaws a range of direct or indirect links with a "foreign country or an institution, organisation or individual" outside greater china, covering offences from the stealing of secrets and waging war to engaging in "hostile activities" and "provoking hatred".
they can be punished by up to life in prison.
mr smith is a career us foreign service officer who has deep experience in china and the wider region, serving in shanghai, beijing and taiwan before arriving in hong kong in july 2019. he made his comments in an interview at the us diplomatic mission in hong kong on wednesday, after reuters sought the consulate's views on the impact of the national security law.
in a response to reuters, hong kong's security bureau said that "normal interactions and activities" were protected, and blamed external elements for interfering in the city during the protests that engulfed hong kong in 2019.
"there are indications in investigations and intelligence that foreign intervention was rampant, with money, supplies and other forms of support," a representative said.
he did not identify specific individuals or groups.
government adviser and former security chief regina ip told reuters it was only "china haters" who had reason to worry about falling foul of the law.
"there must be criminal intent, not just casual chat," she said.
fourteen asian and western diplomats who spoke to reuters for this story said they were alarmed at attempts by hong kong prosecutors to treat links between local politicians and foreign envoys as potential national security threats.
"it's appalling that people would take a routine interaction with a foreign government representative and attribute something sinister to it," mr smith said.
hong kong yesterday slammed a british government report that said beijing was using the security law to "drastically curtail freedoms" in the city.
the hong kong authorities also this week lambasted the european union for denouncing hong kong's recent overhaul of its political system.
although local officials said last year that the security law would affect only a "tiny minority" of people, more than 100 have been arrested under the law.
retired judges said they were shocked at the broad use of foreign connections by prosecutors.
one told reuters he did not see how that approach would be sustainable, as the government accredits diplomats, whose job is to meet people, including politicians.
hong kong's judiciary said it would not comment on individual cases.

singapore singaporeans studying in australian institutions are looking forward to a proposed travel bubble between the two countries, as they may finally be able to return to their campuses there or spend holidays with their families here.
prime minister lee hsien loong and his australian counterpart scott morrison said on thursday that the two countries are working towards an air travel bubble.
they hoped singapore students in australia, whose studies have been disrupted by the covid-19 travel restrictions, would be the first to get the opportunity to travel under the arrangement.
all six students the straits times spoke to on friday (june 11) expressed optimism about the travel bubble.
for first-year students like mr chris gan, who is doing his bachelor's degree in politics, philosophy and economics at the australian national university, it will be his first chance to set foot on its campus.
the 21-year-old said he was not too concerned that the travel bubble may be one-way.
"i am confident singaporeans will be able to travel to australia too.
"mr sun yuchen, 23, a third-year student at the university of melbourne who is currently on a year's leave of absence, is looking forward to returning to campus.
"i see a chance for me to return to australia to complete my studies and gain experience by using actual facilities the school provides," he said.
singaporeans who are currently in australia, such as university of new south wales student joseph tan, look forward to reuniting with family here.
the 23-year-old, who has been in australia since february last year, said he had been unable to return home, as his degree in aviation requires him to attend flying lessons there.
he added: "the travel bubble between singapore and australia comes as a relief to me as i have the opportunity to finally return home and see my family after being away for so long.
even if i can only return for a few days, it is comforting to return home again.
"students who returned to singapore when the covid-19 pandemic worsened said the past year had been tough for them.
psychology student audrey chan, 23, is a final-year student at the university of queensland.
she has been continuing her classes remotely since returning to singapore in march last year.
she said: "my singaporean and malaysian peers agree that we often feel like an outsider or a cctv spying on the class via zoom, and this makes class participation painfully awkward and hard for us.
some of us are stressed out, as we find it hard to keep up with the class, especially when technology fails us.
"university of adelaide student shalynn tsai, 21, who is doing her bachelor's degree in dental surgery, had to take leave of absence because she was unable to return to campus by mid-september last year.
"it has been very stressful not knowing when or whether we can even continue with our degree courses," she said.
"with the travel bubble, we can finally go back and resume our studies.
"while the students understand that they may need to undergo pre-departure and arrival tests for the coronavirus, they hoped they would not have to incur hefty charges and would not have to be quarantined if already vaccinated.
mr ryan soh, 21, will be commencing his communication studies at queensland university of technology later this month.
"i hope that there will be no need for a quarantine once vaccination has been done and the covid-19 test comes back negative.
kind of like what's going on between new zealand and australia," he said.
"nevertheless, if there is a need for quarantine, then hopefully it would be more accessible or cheaper for students, as some of us may not be able to afford it.
"mr tan felt the same.
"hopefully it will not be too expensive and there will not be a need to self-quarantine for too long once i arrive at either destination.
i understand the need for the covid-19 tests to ensure there are no imported cases and hope that both countries can maintain the safety of not only its residents but those travelling as well," he said.

beijing: a new chinese law against foreign sanctions is designed to boost beijing's power against international pressure, but could spark compliance dilemmas for foreign businesses operating in the world's second-largest economy.
it comes just a week after us president joe biden expanded a blacklist of chinese companies in which americans are not allowed to invest.
here is what we know about the law so far:what is it?the anti-foreign sanctions law was rushed into force on thursday (jun 10).
it aims to protect chinese individuals or organisations in the event that a country "uses various pretexts or its laws" to take "discriminatory" action against them.
no country is specifically named.
but beijing has accused western nations of "suppressing" china's development, especially the united states.
it has lashed out at "illegal and unreasonable" sanctions over human rights and flagged an urgent need to fight back.
what could it do?countermeasures listed in the law include denying visas, deportation, or seizing assets of those who formulate or comply with sanctions against chinese businesses or officials.
it rules that authorities are not only able to target individuals and groups but can also take aim at their family members.
the law is broad and "significantly increases the punitive power of china's anti-sanctions measures", said university of hong kong associate professor angela zhang.
"the broad scope of this framework means that lots of folks, like scholars, pundits, think tanks, could be sanctioned for supporting sanctions on china," warned julian ku, an expert on international law at hofstra university.
how could it impact business?senior executives of entities on a countermeasure list could also come under pressure, with potential implications for a large number of people and businesses.
"affected businesses could lose entire access to the chinese market, and chinese citizens and institutions will need to cut ties with affected ngos and think tanks," zhang told afp.
the law could also create severe compliance issues for multinational companies.
part of the legislation prohibits those in china from going along with designated foreign sanctions.
it acts in a similar way to a european blocking statute "which nullified the effect of us iran sanctions within the eu", said ku.
this puts foreign businesses in a bind if they cannot legally comply with both us sanctions and chinese prohibitions.
why now?the law builds on earlier measures which prevent companies and individuals from complying with foreign sanctions targeting china.
in an explainer on the national people's congress website, an official said the law was passed in a short period of time because there was "an urgent need to counter the hegemonism and power politics of certain western countries".
the law will help "counteract the containment and suppression" china faces, the official added.
beijing has long complained about us sanctions and trade restrictions affecting chinese companies.
but in recent months biden has stepped up us criticism over intellectual property theft and alleged human rights abuses in hong kong and the northwestern xinjiang region.
how much of a threat is it?ku warned the law had "some reasonable parts, and some troubling parts".
the section allowing for retaliatory sanctions "is unprecedented compared to other countries' sanctions regimes", he said.
foreign companies are regularly caught in the crosshairs of tension between china and western nations, including recent nationalist attacks on fashion brand h&m for voicing concern about forced labour claims in xinjiang.
zhang said she believes chinese authorities will not immediately wield the new powers, given that anxiety among foreign businesses could lead to more decoupling.
"if, however, foreign governments continue to press on with aggressive sanctions, then i believe china will start deploying those anti-sanctions laws to demonstrate their coercive power," she said.

benjamin netanyahu has pushed israeli politics firmly to the right over the years (file)israeli lawmakers are to vote sunday on a "change" coalition government of bitter ideological rivals united by their determination to banish prime minister benjamin netanyahu from power.
the crunch knesset vote will either terminate the hawkish premier's uninterrupted 12-year tenure or return israel to a stalemate likely to trigger a fifth general election since 2019. netanyahu, who is battling a clutch of corruption charges in an ongoing trial he dismisses as a conspiracy, has pushed israeli politics firmly to the right over the years.
on saturday night, around 2,000 protesters rallied outside the 71-year-old's official residence to celebrate what they believe will be his departure from office.
"for us, this is a big night and tomorrow will be even a bigger day.
i am almost crying.
we fought peacefully for this (netanyahu's departure) and the day has come," said protester ofir robinski.
a fragile eight-party alliance, ranging from the right-wing jewish nationalist yamina party to arab lawmakers, was early this month cobbled together by centrist politician yair lapid.
on friday, all coalition agreements had been signed and submitted to the knesset secretariat, yamina announced, a moment party leader naftali bennett said brought "to an end two and a half years of political crisis".
but the ever-combative netanyahu has tried to peel off defectors that would deprive the nascent coalition of its wafer thin legislative majority.
'peaceful transition'if the new government is confirmed, bennett, a former defence minister, would serve as premier for two years.
coalition architect lapid, who heads the yesh atid party and is a former television presenter, would then take the helm.
the anti-netanyahu bloc spans the political spectrum, including three right-wing, two centrist and two left-wing parties, along with an arab islamic conservative party.
the improbable alliance emerged two weeks after an 11-day war between israel and hamas, the islamist group that rules the palestinian enclave of gaza and following inter-communal violence in israeli cities with significant arab populations.
"we will work together, out of partnership and national responsibility -- and i believe we will succeed," bennett said friday.
sunday's crucial knesset session is due to open at 4:00 pm local time (1300 gmt), with bennett, lapid and netanyahu all set to speak before the vote.
netanyahu has heaped pressure on his former right-wing allies to defect from the fledgling coalition while attacking the legitimacy of the bennett-lapid partnership.
he has accused bennett of "fraud" for siding with rivals, and angry rallies by the premier's likud party supporters have resulted in security being bolstered for some lawmakers.
netanyahu's bombastic remarks as he sees his grip on power slip have drawn parallels at home and abroad to former us president donald trump, who described his election loss last year as the result of a rigged vote.
the prime minister has called the prospective coalition "the greatest election fraud in the history" of israel.
his likud party said the accusations refer to bennett entering a coalition that "doesn't reflect the will of the voters".
'scorched earth'sunday's vote arrives hot on the heels of police crackdowns on palestinian protests over the threatened eviction of families from homes in israeli-annexed east jerusalem to make way for jewish settlers, a month after similar clashes fuelled the latest war between israel and hamas.
it also comes amid right-wing anger over the postponement of a controversial jewish nationalist march.
netanyahu favoured finding a way to allow the so-called "march of the flags", originally scheduled to take place last thursday, to proceed as planned.
he took that position despite the original route envisaging the march unfolding close to flashpoint areas including the al-aqsa mosque compound, where clashes last month triggered the gaza conflict.
the premier's insistence saw his opponents accuse him and his allies of stoking tensions to cling onto power via a "scorched-earth" campaign.
if netanyahu loses the premiership, he will not be able to push through changes to basic laws that could give him immunity in regard to his corruption trial.
the controversial flag march is now slated for tuesday and ongoing tensions surrounding it could represent a key initial test for any approved coalition.

                    friday, 11 jun 2021
                the meeting between australia's pm scott morrison and singapore leader lee hsien loong on thursday (june 10) was the first in-person meeting between them in more than a year.
the straits times/annsingapore, june 11 (bloomberg): a planned quarantine-free travel corridor between australia and singapore may take months to open because of delays to australia's covid-19 vaccination programme.
the two countries are "putting systems in place that will enable such a bubble to emerge between singapore and australia as it does now occur between australia and new zealand, " australia prime minister scott morrison said at a joint virtual press conference after meeting singapore prime minister lee hsien loong on thursday.
he cautioned that any corridor is still some time away.
such a bubble hinges on vaccination rates, lee told reporters.
"once the majority of the population is vaccinated, it becomes much easier for us to contemplate these openings up, " he said.
that means an operational air-travel corridor could be months away, at least.
only about 5.
5 million out of 26 million australians have had at least one jab, meaning some border restrictions are likely to remain well into next year.
morrison's government has abandoned its original october target to inoculate the population.
singapore and australia are among a handful of asia-pacific countries that have managed to contain the coronavirus and have been reluctant to ease border restrictions.
australia has largely closed its shores to non-citizens and residents since last year, while singapore doesn't allow most short-term visitors to enter, except for those under programs such as a green lane for business travelers.
australia's strategy of eliminating covid-19 cases within the community has come under increasing pressure due to leaks of the virus into the community from hotels used to quarantine australians returning from overseas, triggering localised lockdowns.
melbourne, the second-most populous city with more than five million people, exited a two-week lockdown on friday.
morrison said discussions between the nations have included giving priority to students from singapore to return to australia to complete their studies.
that would be a "first opportunity" for increased travel between the nations, he said.
"when all the preparations are ready, then we can start small with an air-travel bubble to build confidence, " lee said at the media conference.
morrison was on an official visit to the city-state, and is due in the u. k.  to attend the group of seven leaders' summit this weekend.

the covid-19 vaccine task force of the u. s.  centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) stated that it has observed increased cases of heart inflammation in adolescents and younger adults, especially aged 12 to 24, following inoculation with authorized mrna-based covid-19 vaccines from moderna mrna, and pfizer pfe/biontech bntx.
several hundreds of cases of myocarditis and pericarditis, both conditions of heart inflammation, were reported to the u. s.  government's vaers (vaccine adverse event reporting system) following dose 1 of any mrna-based vaccine in the last two months.
please note that vaers is a national early warning system to detect possible safety problems in u. s.  licensed vaccines.
the number of cases increased further after the second dose of these vaccines.
moreover, the cases occurred in higher number of younger patients following dose 2 compared to dose 1.  the cdc stated that similar inflammation cases were not reported following vaccination with j&j's jnj adenovirus-based covid-19 vaccine.
per a reuters report, the israel's health ministry raised the alarm when it reported a likely link of heart inflammation in young men vaccinated with pfizer's bnt162b earlier this month.
following this report, the cdc and health regulators in other countries started investigating such cases.
although the number of reported cases is small compared to total inoculations with mrna vaccines, they were higher than expected in the younger age groups.
we note that the cdc is yet to link these adverse events to mrna vaccines and has scheduled a meeting of the advisory committee on immunization practices (acip) on jun 18 to discuss and assess the heart inflammation reports.
moreover, the government authority has recommended continuation of vaccination for everyone of age 12 or older given the risk of covid-19 illness and related complications.
however, we note that the cdc report also stated that more than 50% of heart inflammation cases were reported in the age group of 12-24 that has received only 8.
8% of vaccine doses.
this suggests that any adverse outcome from the acip meeting scheduled next week can hamper vaccination with mrna vaccines in the adolescent patient group, and hurt prospects of these vaccine developers.
however, the percentage of inflammation cases suggests that the risk from these vaccines is significantly lower than their benefits.
a cdc study claims that these vaccines are 91% effective.
moreover, most patients facing inflammation issues quickly felt better following medication and rest.
we remind investors that pfizer/biontech's covid-19 vaccine received authorization for emergency use in adolescents last month from the fda.
moderna filed for a similar authorization in the united states, europe and canada earlier this month.
meanwhile, pfizer and biontech have pledged two billion doses of their covid-19 vaccines to ensure equitable access to their vaccines globally.
as part of the pledge, the company plans to supply 200 million doses in 2021 and 300 million doses in the first half of 2022 to the u. s.  government at not-for-profit price.
the government will donate these doses to low- and lower middle-income countries and organizations that support them.

there have been big bts buildups elsewhere, including the philippines, where a special app has been created and videos have appearing on social media apps like tiktok, of mcdonald's staff in multiple outlets mimicking the boy band's moves.
mcdonald's will release the bts meal next week, comprising nuggets, a soft drink fries and two dipping sauces.

singapore — a secret society member who brutally assaulted a police officer and caused him to suffer a traumatic brain injury with help from his twin brother was jailed for two years, nine months and four weeks on friday (11 june).
muhammad farhan jaffri and his twin brother muhammad fiqkri jaffri, both 26, attacked sergeant chong jiawei, 27, a ground response officer who was on patrol duty on 23 february last year.
the attack left chong unconscious and incapacitated, and he was given 29 days of leave due to his injuries.
farhan, who pleaded guilty to five charges of causing grievous hurt and hurt to a public servant, vandalism, being a member of a secret society and using abusive language on a public servant, was also given three strokes of the cane and fined $3,500.
four charges of a similar nature were considered for his sentencing.
fiqkri's case is still pending before the courts.
he faces seven charges, including causing grievous hurt to a public servant.
on 23 february last year, at about 4am, farhan, who was drunk, was having an argument with his wife at the void deck of block 755 jurong west street 74 when a member of the public called the police over the commotion.
four police officers, including chong, were dispatched to the location, and they saw farhan's wife in tears.
a female police officer was checking on the wife when farhan became defensive.
at this point, fiqkri arrived and approached the officers aggressively, pointing his finger at the officers and demanding to know why they were questioning his brother.
fiqkri asked farhan and his wife to return to his unit and asked the police officers to "shut up".
farhan left but verbally abused the female police officer first.
within minutes, farhan returned and shouted that he did not like the faces of the officers.
his twin asked farhan whose face he did not like and farhan gestured at chong's face.
fiqkri turned to chong and swung his fist at the officer's face.
chong fell to the ground and farhan joined him in assaulting the police officer.
farhan and fiqkri rained punches and kicks on the officer, despite attempts by the other officers to restrain the brothers.
the brothers hurt another male officer, who was on reservist, during the struggle.
their violence prompted the female police officer to draw her baton and call for reinforcement.
they finally managed to handcuff fiqkri.
two other police officers arrived and handcuffed farhan.
after farhan was escorted into the police vehicle, he yelled and knocked his head on the window repeatedly.
he then kicked the window three times, causing the right rear window to shatter.
at that point in time, one officer was standing guard beside the right rear seat of the vehicle.
the damage cost $201.
farhan has since made full restitution.
chong was conveyed to hospital.
his medical report, dated 9 march last year, stated that as a result for the attack, chong slumped to the ground and briefly lost consciousness.
he was diagnosed with abrasions over his eyelid, laceration over his ear, facial bruises, and a concussion.

euro 2020 was still reeling sunday after denmark midfielder christian eriksen collapsed and had to be revived by medics on the pitch during his country's defeat to finland.
this is the moment a gang mowed down a man twice in a brutal attack.
gang leader david 'porky' clark, 36, was driving a mercedes when he and his crew deliberately tried to run over the victim in ridley street, southwick, sunderland.
as the man tried to flee in a silver hatchback, clark and the driver of a volvo rammed the car and smashed into another parked vehicle.
he was hit twice by the cars and his vehicle rammed a further three times in the shocking attack on april 5, 2020. watch: moment gang repeatedly ran over man in brutal attackmoments later, clark – aided by shaun hewitt, shaun mcgregor and leigh coulson disarmed luke owen, who possessed a machete.
owen was then stabbed with the machete in the middle of the street, leaving him with serious leg injuries and cuts to his face.
earlier on the same evening, clark's girlfriend coulson threatened an occupant on the same street as the attack.
she told the victim he would be "burnt to a crisp" and said a car would be driven through his living room.
a vehicle was reversed into the front door of the address and set on fire later that night.
all five gang members, from sunderland, admitted a string of offences at newcastle crown court in february.

hewitt was jailed for one year, mcgregor was jailed for 15 months and owen received an 11-month sentence suspended for 12 months.
detective inspector andy richardson, of northumbria police, said: "the violence that we saw on the streets of southwick that night was appalling and all five defendants should be ashamed of themselves.
"the series of incidents unfolded in a residential area where families watched on in shock – and they will no doubt have been horrified to see this level of offending justyards from their front door.
"clark was at the centre of the disorder and is somebody who has consistently shown a total disregard for the law.
"i am pleased that he is now behind bars and the severity of his crimes reflected in his sentence.
"we will not tolerate violence in our communities and hope this outcome offers reassurance to our communities.
"we are committed to continue tackling serious and organised criminality.

novak djokovic compared defeating rafael nadal at the french open to scaling mount everest as he hailed friday's epic semi-final triumph over the 13-time champion as "one of my greatest victories".
djokovic condemned nadal to only his third loss in 16 years and 108 matches at roland garros to reach his sixth paris final after a classic showdown which even beat the country's covid-19 curfew.
in their 58th career clash, djokovic triumphed 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 and stays on course to capture a 19th major and become the first man in over 50 years to win all four slams twice.
djokovic, the 2016 champion in paris who had also beaten nadal in the 2015 quarter-finals, will face stefanos tsitsipas in sunday's final in what will be his 29th championship match at the slams.
tsitsipas had earlier become the first greek to reach a grand slam final with a 6-3, 6-3, 4-6, 4-6, 6-3 victory over germany's alexander zverev.
defending champion nadal, 35, who would have been the oldest finalist at the french open in the modern era, remains tied on 20 majors with roger federer.
"it was a privilege to face rafa in such an incredible match," said djokovic after four hours and 11 minutes of intense action.
"tonight it was my greatest ever match in paris.
"it was his second win in nine meetings at roland garros with nadal, a sequence which also included devastating losses in the 2012, 2014 and 2020 finals.
"definitely one of the top three matches that i ever played in my entire career," said djokovic.
"considering the quality of tennis, playing my biggest rival on the court where he has had so much success and has been the dominant force in the last 15-plus years, and the atmosphere which was completely electric.
just amazing.
"it was nadal's first defeat in 14 semi-finals in the french capital.
"probably it was not my best day today, even if i fought," said nadal.
"sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.
i had a big chance.
there were some crazy points but there was fatigue there.
"djokovic finished with 50 winners; nadal committed 55 unforced errors under a relentless assault.
"it's hard to find words bigger than all the superlatives you can think of for rafa's achievements in roland garros," added 34-year-old djokovic who now leads their series 30-28.
"each time you step on the court with him, you know that you have to kind of climb mount everest to win against this guy here.
"nadal bemoaned the humid conditions which became heavier and slower as the evening progressed.
"we had been playing with very warm and high bounces.
during the night the situation goes a little bit the other way," he said.
"so the bounce is a little less.
the ball gets less top-spin.
that's more favourable for him.
"djokovic had two break points in the opening game of the first set which stretched to 10 minutes but was unable to convert.
curfew-buster -nadal made him pay, sprinting away for a 5-0 lead before the top seed got on the board.
djokovic clung on, retrieving one break to get to 2-5 but nadal eventually prevailed after one hour on court even if he required seven set points to edge ahead.
as a sign of the tension of the occasion, nadal complained to chair umpire eva asderaki-moore that he needed more time to collect his towel.
djokovic aired his bemusement at the amount of clay on the baselines.
the old rivals exchanged breaks in the second and third games of a big-hitting second set but it was djokovic who repeated the feat for a 4-2 lead before levelling the tie.
twice in the third set djokovic edged ahead, only to be reeled back in by nadal who broke back in the 10th game as the world number one served for the set.
djokovic then had to save a set point with an ice-cool drop shot in the 12th game.
"you cannot play better clay court tennis than this.
it's perfect," tweeted an admiring andy murray, the former world number one who lost the 2016 final to djokovic.
the 92-minute third set ended with djokovic taking the tiebreak.
in a further twist on a dramatic evening, the 5,000 spectators inside court philippe chatrier were allowed to watch the conclusion of the match despite it passing the 11pm covid-19 curfew.
"in agreement with the national authorities, the match will come to an end in your presence," said a stadium announcer told delighted fans.
nadal broke in the first game of the fourth set but djokovic levelled for 2-2 and broke again for 4-2. he finished it off on a second match point when nadal hit wide and long.

rio de janeiro:     nearly two thirds of brazilians oppose the country hosting the upcoming copa america soccer tournament, a poll showed on friday, amid concerns over the country's dire covid-19 outbreak.
the south american football confederation last week unexpectedly relocated the tournament, which kicks off on sunday, with brazilian president jair bolsonaro's backing.
brazil stepped up after co-hosts colombia were dropped because of civil unrest and argentina withdrew after a surge in coronavirus infections.
bolsonaro has played down the severity of the pandemic and fought against lockdowns to control an outbreak that has killed more than 480,000 brazilians.
public health experts, supreme court justices and footballers questioned the wisdom of hosting the tournament with a pandemic raging, while high-profile sponsors have pulled out.
according to an xp/ipespe poll, 64per cent of respondents were against hosting the cup, while 29per cent were in favor.
among bolsonaro's critics, 83per cent were against the tournament in brazil, while 35per cent of his supporters also did not support the competition.
ahead of next year's elections, former leftist president luiz inacio lula da silva appears to be strengthening his lead over bolsonaro, the poll showed.
although neither men have announced their candidacy, the 2022 election is widely expected to be a run-off between the two polarizing figures.
in the first round vote, lula saw his share rise to 32per cent, up three percentage points from a may poll.
bolsonaro's first-round support slipped one percentage point to 28per cent.
in a simulated second-round matchup, lula's support rose to 45per cent from 42per cent in the previous survey, while bolsonaro's fell to 36per cent from 40per cent.
the poll was based on 1,000 interviews, conducted from june 7-10, with a margin of error of 3.

israel's parliament is expected to approve the formation of a new government later on sunday, ending 12 years of rule by pm benjamin netanyahu.
the prospective government an unprecedented coalition of parties has a razor-thin majority of one seat.
it would also end more than two years of political paralysis in which three elections resulted in stalemate.
right-wing nationalist naftali bennett is poised to become pm in a power-sharing deal with a centrist leader.
under the coalition agreement, mr bennett, who heads the yamina party, will hold office until september 2023, when he will hand over to yair lapid, leader of yesh atid, for a further two years.
mr netanyahu israel's longest-serving leader, who has dominated its political landscape for years would remain head of the right-wing likud party and become leader of the opposition.
he has railed against the likely new government, calling it a "dangerous coalition of fraud and surrender" and has vowed to "overthrow it very quickly".
meanwhile, his trial on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust allegations he denies continues.
mr netanyahu has served a record-breaking five terms, first from 1996 to 1999, then continuously from 2009 to 2021. he called an election in april 2019 but failed to win enough support to form a new coalition government.
two more elections followed, each of which ended inconclusively.
the third election resulted in a government of national unity where mr netanyahu agreed to share power with the then-opposition leader benny gantz.
but the arrangement collapsed in december, triggering a fourth election.
although likud emerged as the largest party in the 120-seat parliament, mr netanyahu was again unable to form a governing coalition and the task was handed to mr lapid, whose party had emerged as the second largest.
opposition to mr netanyahu staying in power had grown, not just among the left and centre but also among right-wing parties that are ordinarily ideologically aligned to likud, including yamina.
although yamina came joint fifth in the election with only seven seats, its support was critical if any potential coalition government was to have a majority in parliament.
after weeks of negotiations, mr lapid brought yamina on board as part of a constellation of parties whose only common goal was to remove mr netanyahu from office.
the agreement involving eight factions with the 61 seats required for a majority was signed on 2 june, just half an hour before a deadline was due to expire, effectively sealing mr netanyahu's fate.
in appearance, mr bennett's government would be unlike any which has preceded it in israel's 73-year history.
the alliance contains parties which have vast ideological differences, and perhaps most significantly includes the first independent arab party to be part of a potential ruling coalition, raam.
it is also expected to have a record number of eight female ministers.
the inclusion of raam and left-wing non-arab israeli parties means there could be friction on issues such as israeli policies towards palestinians yamina and another right-wing party, new hope, are staunch supporters of jewish settlement in the israeli-occupied west bank, for instance.
there could also be difficulties over social policies while some parties want to advance gay rights, such as recognising same sex marriages, raam, an islamist party, is against this.
in addition, some parties want to relax religious restrictions more extensively than yamina a national-religious party will likely allow.
mr bennett has indicated his government would focus on areas where agreement was possible, like economic issues or the coronavirus pandemic, while avoiding more contentious matters.
"nobody will have to give up their ideology," he recently said, "but all will have to postpone the realisation of some of their dreams.
.
.
we'll focus on what can be achieved, rather than arguing about what cannot. "

a taiwanese court on friday handed prison terms to a dozen former presidential security agents and airline employees over their roles in a cigarette smuggling scandal on the island two years ago.
a bodyguard in president tsai ing-wen's entourage tried to bring in 9,800 cigarette cartons as he returned from an official trip accompanying tsai to the caribbean.
the president said at the time that she had no idea her security team was involved and ordered an investigation.
the agent, identified as wu tsung-hsien of the national security bureau, received the heaviest sentence of 10 years and four months on corruption and tax evasion charges, according to taipei district court.
wu tried to pass the cigarettes off as cargo from tsai's presidential plane in an effort to smuggle them past customs, authorities said.
it was later discovered that the scam was not a one-off when china airlines released figures showing huge amounts of duty-free cigarettes were routinely purchased during presidential visits.
the defendants "deprived the government of tax revenue, and seriously damaged the nation's image", judge huang pei-chen told a virtual press conference.
the value of duty evaded on the cigarettes amounted to nearly tw$8.
2 million ($273,000), according to the court.
wu's colleague and main accomplice chang heng-chia was sentenced to 10 years and two months while six other ex-agents received jail terms ranging from six years and two months to seven years.

singapore: while racism exists, singapore has made "tremendous progress" in racial harmony over the years, said law and home affairs minister k shanmugam on thursday (jun 10) in an interview with cna938.
his comments follow recent incidents of alleged racism in public.
last week, a viral video emerged showing aman making racist remarkstowards an interracial couple at orchard road.
in another incident last month,a 55-year-old woman was allegedly kickedand subjected to racial slurs by a 30-year-old man while she was brisk walking.
when asked during the interview if singapore's racial harmony is on a knife-edge, mr shanmugam said: "i've always said there is racism in singapore, but we are a better society than most other multi-racial societies that i know of.
"i mean, name me a society where there is no racism, which is multi-racial?
i've felt that we have made tremendous progress.
"he added: "most people accept the norms of a multiracial society and we are making progress.
the direction was positive and direction has been positive.
"mr shanmugam had said last week following the incident at orchard road that he is "not so sure anymore" that singapore is "moving in the right direction" on racial tolerance.
"it's the direction that i'm concerned about," he added on thursday.
"but as of today, i won't say we are at knife-edge.
i think that will be over-dramatising it.
"mr shanmugam also said that people should call out racism and do it sensibly.
"when it's in the public square, i think you should call out, you should frown against it and you should take action where it breaches the law, because it is cancerous, it's divisive and it undermines the values of our society," he added.
on how the law deals with such incidents, mr shanmugam said there is a "fairly strict framework" in singapore, but the country has to go beyond that to maintain racial harmony.
"legal framework is one part of it, but the government and society have to work very hard to maintain harmony.
you can't bring about harmony and racial tolerance and acceptance just by having laws and enforcing them, you need to do much more," he said.
"the laws give the framework, the foundation, they are important, but you got to go beyond that.
and the answer is not every time something happens, you charge," he added.
"when it is serious, investigations are conducted, then the attorney general decides sometimes a warning, sometimes people are charged.
but you are careful in the way you exercise that power.
"although the government plays "an extremely important role" in safeguarding racial and religious harmony, singaporeans have a part to play as well, mr shanmugam said.
"it's not a subtraction from singaporeans to say, 'i'm an indian', 'i'm a chinese', 'i'm a malay', or sub-identities.
those are extremely important.
they give us our cultural ballast," he said.
"but beyond that, we are also singaporeans, and that is a common identity.
we have to emphasise that common identity, even as we recognise, accept, emphasise our individual identities.
we need to have that common vision to say, look, we want to build a system based on justice, equality, meritocracy, and where everyone can feel equal, and everyone can feel protected," he added.
"the government has a huge role in articulating that vision and being fair.
"need for deeper engagementin a facebook post earlier on thursday,president halimah yacob said that while singapore's primary recourse has been the law and that those found guilty have been "rightly punished", this will not stop hate and chauvinism from perpetuating.
"it is agonising to read about the incidents of hatred and chauvinism perpetrated by singaporeans against each other.
such displays are so hurtful because we thought that we had done so much to protect our cohesion until we are shaken from our belief," she said.
"our greatest fear is how such prejudice will affect our young and influence their minds.
we wonder whether these are one-off incidents or reflective of a larger problem.
"mdm halimah called for deeper engagements about why cohesion is important and what it means to be a truly multiracial and multi-religious society.
"we need this, as arguments such as the social media and the current pandemic as contributing factors, may mask the real issues," she said.
"in the meantime, let us start by being kinder to each other.
we can control how we want to respond and do so in a constructive and meaningful way.

tokyo there is "no change" in japan's position towards taiwan, top government spokesman katsunobu kato said on friday (june 11), two days after prime minister yoshihide suga stoked china's fury by calling taiwan a "country".
mr kato told reporters that "there is no change in japan's basic position of maintaining a non-governmental, practical relationship with taiwan", in line with the 1972 japan-china communique.
in what seems like an accidental slip-up, mr suga said at a nationally televised diet debate on wednesday that australia, new zealand and taiwan are "three countries that have imposed strong curbs on individual rights" amid the covid-19 crisis.
the reference of taiwan as a country (kuni or koku) goes against diplomatic tradition of referring to the island, which beijing regards as a renegade breakaway province, as a region (chi-iki).
beijing has lodged stern representations with tokyo.
on thursday, chinese foreign minister spokesman wang wenbin deplored japan for violating the spirit of the 1972 joint declaration issued when the two countries formalised relations.
according to the communique, japan recognises the people's republic of china government in beijing as the "sole legal" government of china.
it also "fully understands and respects" that taiwan is an "inalienable part" of chinese territory.
mr wang said that mr suga's statement not only "broke japan's solemn promise not to regard taiwan as a country", but also threatened to undermine the diplomatic foundation of sino-japan ties.
these sensitivities come as taiwan has become a political flashpoint amid chinese muscle-flexing in regional waters.
fears are also rising among democratic nations of an expansion in communist influence, with the clampdown on freedoms in hong kong and china's vaccine diplomacy that is said to come with terms attached.
leaders of the group of seven (g-7) advanced economies, including mr suga, who are meeting in britain this weekend, will likely write the taiwan strait into their communique, japanese media have reported.
they will also pledge to donate one billion doses of vaccines to developing countries.
the first mention of taiwan in a joint united states-japan summit statement since 1969 came in april, when us president joe biden and mr suga cited the "importance of peace and stability across the taiwan strait".
japan has followed up with similar language in statements with the european union and this week, at a meeting with australian foreign and defence ministers.
this month, japan donated 1.
24 million doses of astrazeneca vaccine to taiwan amid a surge in covid-19 infections there, in a move that china has lambasted as "political theatre".
separately on friday, japan's diet passed a resolution to urge the world health organisation to include taiwan at its general meetings.
foreign minister toshimitsu motegi said the "region's" experience in its covid-19 fight makes its input invaluable to the global community.

former students of ngee ann polytechnic engineering lecturer tan boon lee have accused him of racially and religiously insensitive behaviour in the classroom.
one of them, ms nurul fatimah iskandar, 22, said in an instagram post on wednesday that mr tan had initiated an offensive discussion about islam during lesson time, when she was his student about four years ago.
she told the straits times yesterday: "he opened websites about islam and explained why he didn't agree with certain quranic verses.
"he then singled me out and tried to start a debate on the topic.
it didn't help that i was the only muslim student in class and i sat in the front row.
"asked about ms nurul's allegations, mr tan declined to comment "at the moment" but said he remembers her as a former student.
the polytechnic told the straits times last night that it was aware of the allegations against mr tan and deeply regrets ms nurul's experience.
it added that it has a zero-tolerance approach to any form of misconduct by members of its community.
"our staff members are expected to respect the cultural, ethnic and religious differences when interacting with students and other staff members," a spokesman for the poly said.
second minister for education maliki osman also addressed ms nurul's post, saying he was "shocked and disappointed" to hear about mr tan sharing his "personal and derogatory views on islam".
"there is no place for any anti-ethnic and anti-religious remarks in our education institutions, and even more so from an educator," dr maliki said in a post on facebook last night.
mr tan, 60, is assisting the police with investigations after he was filmed making racist remarks to ice cream store owner dave parkash, 26, and his girlfriend jacqueline ho, 27, a user experience designer, in orchard road last saturday night.
the polytechnic has suspended him from teaching duties and is conducting an internal investigation after a video of the incident surfaced online on sunday.
in its statement last night, the polytechnic added that it would not hesitate to take disciplinary actions against mr tan, including dismissal, if appropriate.
ms nurul, who is now an electrical engineering student at the national university of singapore, said the incident involving mr tan happened in july 2017. she was a second-year electrical engineering student at the polytechnic at the time.
ms nurul said it was tough for her to speak up against her lecturer as she was afraid her scholarship would be at stake if things went badly.
ms nurul finally mustered the courage to send an e-mail to the school about what happened.
she never got a response, she said.
since she put up the post about the incident on instagram, ms nurul said more accounts about mr tan from other students have come to her attention.
one instagram user alleged that mr tan once made disparaging comments about christianity in class, causing outrage among students.
another alleged that he had made her take off her hijab.
national institute of education don jason tan said while it is important for teachers to be able to conduct discussions on difficult issues such as race and religion, they must do so with basic respect.
"the first step is for them to confront their own biases and prejudices," he said.
"what happens in classrooms shape students' values, attitudes and behaviours.

carbis bay, united kingdom: g7 leaders are on saturday (jun 12) set to agree a joint declaration aimed at preventing another pandemic, as they resume wide-ranging talks at their first in-person summit in almost two years.
the group of leading economies britain, canada, france, germany, italy, japan and the united states will also try to showcase western democratic cohesion against a resurgent china and recalcitrant russia.
they will be joined by the leaders of australia, south africa and south korea, along with india taking part remotely, as the agenda broadens to foreign policy issues and climate change.
the g7 is meeting face to face for the first time since 2019, at a beachside venue in cornwall, southwest england, after the coronavirus led to the cancellation of last year's summit.
the leaders opened the three-day summit friday with expectations of a pledge to donate one billion vaccine doses to poor countries this year and next much too slow to end the crisis now, campaigners said.
us president joe biden arrived with a message of solidarity and resolve in stark contrast to the isolationist stance of his predecessor donald trump.
after the traditional family photo and opening session on "building back better" from covid-19, the leaders spent the evening at a reception hosted by queen elizabeth ii at cornwall's eden project.
a renowned attraction showcasing the world's ecological riches, the site also hosted a g7 meeting with prince charles and 10 international business leaders to discuss ramping up sustainable growth.
the g7 this weekend will also tackle climate change, and safeguarding global biodiversity, to lay the groundwork for the un's pivotal cop26 environmental summit in scotland in november.
the leaders are debating a pledge to protect at least 30 per cent of the world's land and oceans by 2030. on saturday's foreign policy agenda, this year's coup in myanmar and crackdown on pro-democracy supporters in belarus are expected to figure, alongside tensions with russia and china.
most of the leaders will reconvene on monday in brussels for a nato meeting, before biden heads on to his first summit with president vladimir putin in geneva, vowing to deliver a blunt message about russian behaviour.
"i'll tell you (about it) after i've delivered it," biden told reporters friday.
the g7 is expected to finalise the "carbis bay declaration" comprising a series of commitments to prevent a repeat of the devastation wreaked by the coronavirus.
"for the first time today the world's leading democracies have come together to make sure that never again will we be caught unawares," british prime minister boris johnson said in remarks released ahead of the summit's second day.
"that means learning lessons from the last 18 months and doing it differently next time around.
"the declaration will be published sunday alongside the g7's final communique, following a beachside barbecue on saturday night.
the collective steps include slashing the time taken to develop and licence vaccines, treatments and diagnostics for any future disease to under 100 days, while reinforcing global surveillance networks.
the leaders will vow to boost genomic sequencing capacity, and support reforms to strengthen the world health organization (who), according to johnson's government, which like the us wants china to allow new access to who experts to determine how covid-19 first emerged.
who chief tedros adhanom ghebreyesus, criticised in some quarters for being too accommodating of china, welcomed the health pact.
and he said the un agency would examine a british proposal to create a "global pandemic radar" to send early warnings of future outbreaks.
"the world needs a stronger global surveillance system to detect new epidemic and pandemic risks," tedros said.
the g7 leaders are also expected to outline more help for developing nations to build up infrastructure, as a counterpoint to the debt-fuelled spending by china in africa, asia and latin america.

singapore — four antigen rapid test (art) self-test kits will be available from 16 june at guardian, unity, and watsons retail pharmacies, the multi-ministry taskforce (mtf) on covid-19 said on thursday (10 june).
the measure was unveiled by the mtf at a virtual media conference as it announced that singapore will gradually move back to phase 3 (heightened alert) in two steps, with one set of measures taking effect from 14 june and another from 21 june.
more of the self-test kits will be made available at more retail locations progressively.
the self-test kits can produce results in less than 20 minutes, are simple to use and can be self-administered, the ministry of health (moh) said separately in a statement.
to ensure that there are adequate supplies, sales will be initially limited to 10 art kits per person, moh added.
the four kits that have been granted interim authorisation for public sale by the health sciences authority (hsa) are 'abbott panbiotm covid-19 antigen self-test', 'quickvue at-home otc covid-19 test', 'sd biosensor sars-cov-2 antigen self-test nasal', and 'sd biosensor standard q covid-19 ag home test'.
director of medical services kenneth mak told reporters that the art self-test kits complement singapore's overall surveillance strategy.
"these fast and easy-to-use tests allow us to detect infected cases more quickly, in particular among individuals those who do not have acute respiratory infection symptoms, but are concerned that they may have been exposed to covid-19.
"individuals who have a positive result for their art self-test should immediately approach a swab and send home public health preparedness clinic (sash phpc) for a confirmatory polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test.
they are then required to self-isolate until they get a negative pcr test result.
those who test negative on their self-test art should continue to stay vigilant and adhere to prevailing safe management measures.
individuals who have ari symptoms should continue to visit a doctor for a full diagnosis and pcr test instead of relying on an art self-test kit.
hsa said in a separate statement that arts have lower sensitivity than pcr tests and have a higher chance of false negative results.
"incorrect sample preparation or testing process when using the test, or a low viral protein level in the user's nasal sample (e. g.  1-2 days from potential exposure), could also result in a false negative result.
anyone with acute respiratory infection symptoms should consult a doctor," hsa said.
singapore is currently in phase 2 (heightened alert) reopening, which started on 16 may and will end on 13 june.

singapore and australia are looking to work closer together to enhance trade and investment in environmentally sustainable goods and services as well as drive down emissions in maritime operations, as part of deepening ties between the two countries.
a new green economy agreement and a public-private partnership to lower emissions in maritime shipping and port operations were part of discussions between prime minister lee hsien loong and his australian counterpart scott morrison yesterday.
the two leaders met at the istana and reaffirmed the excellent state of bilateral relations, the ministry of foreign affairs (mfa) said in a statement.
they also reaffirmed their shared commitment to strengthening the singapore-australia comprehensive strategic partnership (csp) agreement, which the two countries signed in 2015 to deepen cooperation.
they noted the good progress made in the csp over the past year, despite the challenges presented by covid-19.
the agreement's five pillars are economics and trade, defence and foreign affairs, science and innovation, people-to-people, and the digital economy, which was added as a fifth pillar last year.
the mfa said both prime ministers agreed to keep the csp forward-looking by furthering cooperation in emerging areas.
by building upon a memorandum of understanding on low-cost emissions signed last year, both countries will be embarking on a public-private partnership on low-emission maritime and shipping, said mfa.
a joint statement by the two prime ministers yesterday said that this partnership will start off with a combined initial contribution of up to a$30 million (s$30.
8 million), and will see business and government in australia and singapore work together on low-emission fuels and technologies.
"the prime ministers also discussed exploring a broader partnership on a green economy agreement to facilitate trade and investment in environmentally sustainable goods and services," mfa added.
the ministry also said both countries will start discussions on a fintech bridge to enhance cooperation in fintech policy and regulation, which will build upon the high-level digital economy agreement that they made last year.
this fintech bridge will look for opportunities for collaboration on joint innovation projects, as well as facilitate investments and new business opportunities in digital trade and financial services, said the two prime ministers.
on the defence front, pm lee said at a joint news conference with mr morrison that the republic greatly appreciates australia's generous support for the singapore armed forces' training "over many years, in many airbases and camps all over australia".
a new memorandum of understanding (mou) between the health ministries of the two countries was signed yesterday to enhance cooperation on healthcare and health technologies.
the two countries have also agreed to ink an agreement on operational science and technology cooperation to develop and enhance capabilities for homeland security and law enforcement agencies to prevent crime and maintain law and order.
an existing mou between the singapore symphony orchestra and melbourne symphony orchestra will be renewed as well.
both leaders said that in an increasingly uncertain and complex strategic environment, australia and singapore are like-minded partners with a high degree of strategic trust.
they agreed to increase the frequency and complexity of professional exchanges, dialogues and training activities between the two countries.
the two leaders also discussed regional developments yesterday, and both said a strong, cohesive and responsive asean is vital to the region's success and recovery.
agreeing that asean could play an important role in facilitating a peaceful solution to the situation in myanmar, pm lee and mr morrison called for an immediate cessation of violence, the release of all political detainees there, including foreigners, and inclusive dialogue between all parties.
both prime ministers also reaffirmed their shared commitment to maintaining and promoting peace, security and stability in the region, as well as to the peaceful resolution of disputes, including full respect for legal and diplomatic processes, without resorting to the threat or use of force, in accordance with international law.
they underlined australia and singapore's strong support for freedom of navigation, overflight and unimpeded trade in the south china sea.
"they also emphasised the importance of non-militarisation of disputed features and self-restraint in the conduct of activities that would complicate or escalate disputes and affect peace and stability," said the joint statement.
"they urged all claimants to take meaningful steps to ease tensions and build trust, including through dialogue.

singapore: thesingapore-hong kong air travel bubblewill remain on hold even though the covid-19 situation in singapore has improved, the ministry of transport (mot) said on thursday (jun 10).
authorities on both sides will review the situation in july before deciding on a launch date.
the covid-19 situation in hong kong has remained stable, with very few community cases in recent weeks, the ministry noted.
"both singapore and hong kong remain strongly committed to launching the air travel bubble safely.
we will continue to monitor the public health situation in both places closely," mot said.
both singapore's transport minister s iswaran and hong kong's secretary for commerce and economic development edward yau have maintained "close contact", the ministry said, adding that they agreed that both sides would review the situation in early july, before making a decision on the target launch dates of flights under the air travel bubble.
"an update will be provided at that point," said mot.
the singapore-hong kong air travel bubble was initially scheduled to be launched onnov 22last year, but it was deferred after a rise in covid-19 cases in hong kong.
a rescheduled launch planned formay 26this year was also pushed back due to an increase in unlinked covid-19 community cases in singapore.
under the terms of the agreement, the travel bubble will be suspended for at least 14 days if the seven-day moving average of unlinked local covid-19 cases a day, excluding dormitory resident cases in singapore, is more than five in either singapore or hong kong.
during a press conference by the covid-19 multi-ministry task force on thursday, health minister ong ye kung said he did not think that singapore had met the criteria for the resumption of the air travel bubble.
"and even if we crossed the criteria for resumption .
.
.
we are in a very cautious state," mr ong said in response to a question.
"and so we probably don't want to rush.
it's important that at this state – embers are still there – we want to be quite cautious.
"mr ong said it is, however, important to "get conversations going".
"there's really .
.
.
no harm, and in fact good, to continue to talk to our various partners, to see how we can restore our connections with the world safely.
when the time is right," mr ong said.

washington: the united states and china clashed in rare talks on friday (jun 11) as president joe biden made his international debut at the group of seven (g7) summit, with his administration pressing beijing on covid-19, taiwan and human rights.
secretary of state antony blinken, joining biden at the summit of industrial democracies in england, spoke by telephone with senior chinese official yang jiechi their first talks since a heated in-person encounter in alaska in march.
as biden used his first presidential trip abroad to unveil a massive plan tobuy and distribute 500 million covid-19 vaccine dosesaround the world, blinken renewed us pressure on china over the origins of the pandemic that has killed more than 3.
7 million people.
blinken "stressed the importance of cooperation and transparency regarding the origin of the virus", including allowing world health organization (who) experts back into china, state department spokesman ned price said in a statement.
biden has ordered us intelligence to report back by late august whether covid-19, first detected in late 2019 in the city of wuhan, emerged from an animal source or a laboratory accident.
former president donald trump trotted out the lab-leak theory but was widely dismissed, with many believing he was seeking to deflect criticism over his own handling of the pandemic, but biden has said there was aneed for further studyafter criticising beijing for not giving more access to a who probe.
the laboratory theory has outraged china, which has sought to rebrand itself in the world's eyes not as the country that failed to stop the virus but as a model on how to contain it.
"interests of small circles"yang, a senior politburo member who has long taken a lead in beijing's handling of the united states, renewed denunciations of washington as biden met with leaders from other g7 nations britain, canada, france, germany, italy and japan.
"genuine multilateralism is not pseudo-multilateralism based on the interests of small circles," yang told blinken, according to state television.
"the only genuine multilateralism is that founded on the principles of the charter of the united nations and international law," yang said.
yang also renewed accusations of us hypocrisy on human rights as blinken pressed on what the united states considers the genocide of uyghurs and other mostly muslim turkic people who are incarcerated in camps.
"the united states should resolve its own domestic serious human rights violations, and not use the so-called human rights issues as an excuse to arbitrarily interfere in the internal affairs of other countries," he said.
yang made similar accusations about the united states in front of cameras during the meeting in anchorage, taking aback us officials who expected brief, civil remarks but raising his star power inside china.
concern on taiwanblinken also voiced alarm at china's increasing pressure on taiwan including military flights off its coast.
blinken "called on beijing to cease its pressure campaign against taiwan and peacefully resolve cross-strait issues", the state department statement said.
washington has been increasingly alarmed that china will attempt to use force on taiwan, a self-governing democracy it considers part of its territory, after its sweeping curbs on freedoms in hong kong.
the united states in recent days agreed toreopen trade talks with taiwanand authorised a military plane to bring a delegation of senators who offered covid-19 vaccines.
amid wide bipartisan criticism of china, biden has largely continued the hawkish stance of trump, in substance if not in tone.
the biden administration has described china as a preeminent international challenge and vowed to counter it by shoring up alliances and investing heavily in infrastructure and development at home.

com and associated press  published:  21:03 bst, 11 june 2021   |  updated:  01:22 bst, 12 june 2021    266view  commentsa lobster diver was swallowed whole by a hungry humpback whale but lived to tell the tale because the creature didn't like how he tasted, and spat him back out.
michael packard, 56, had been a commercial lobster diver out of provincetown, massachusetts for 40 years and was going on a routine lobster dive off the coast of cape cod last friday morning when he said he 'felt a huge bump and everything went dark.
'at first, he said he thought he had been attacked by a shark, but when he realized he did not feel any sharp teeth and was not in pain, he began to figure out what had happened.
'i realized, oh my god, i'm in a whale's mouth .
.
.
and he's trying to swallow me,' packard told wbz-tv following the encounter.
'and i thought to myself ok, this is it i'm finally i'm gonna die.
'packard, who is an experienced diver, started to think about his wife and his 12 and 15 year old sons, and began to struggle inside the beast's mouth until, he said, he saw a light and the whale started shaking his head side-to side.
'i just got thrown in the air and landed in the water,' packard recounted to the cbs affiliate.
'i was free and i just floated there.
i couldn't believe.
.
.
i'm here to tell it. '
he estimates he was in the whale's mouth for about 30 seconds, but continued to breathe because he still had his breathing apparatus in.
michael packard, 56, suffered only minor injuries after being trapped inside a humpback whale's mouth for roughly 30 seconds on friday morning.
experts say being eaten by a humpback whale is extremely rare, with one suggesting the whale made a mistake when it sucked packard in and quickly spat him out (file photo)packard had been a lobster diver for 40 years at the time of the incident and was rescued by a crewmate who called authorities on the shorepackard took to facebook following the incident to thank the provincetown rescue squad for its 'caring and help'packard was rescued by his crewmate josiah mayo who was aboard their boat 'the j n' j.
'mayo watched in shock as the water beside the boat erupted as the whale surfaced and packard flew out of the mammal's mouth.
he plucked packard out of the water, according to the cape cod times, and used his radio to call authorities on the shore.
the provincetown fire department later confirmed that a call came in about a diver who had suffered serious injuries to his legs 'after interacting with a whale.
'at first packard said, he thought he had broken his legs in the incident, but doctors later told he he just had soft tissue damage and bruises, and he was released from a local hospital later that day.
in a following facebook post, packard thanked the provincetown rescue squad for its 'caring and help' he said that when he was stuck inside the whale's mouth his thoughts turned to his wife and his 12 and 15 year old sons experts say it is extremely rare to be swallowed by a humpback whale, peter corkeron, a senior scientist at the new england aquarium estimating there is a one in 1 trillion chance someone would be eaten by a whale.
when a humpback feeds, he said,  'they do what we call gulp feeding, and they an open their mouths up incredibly widely,' which jooke robbins, the director of humpback whales studies at the center for coastal studies, said could limit their forward vision.
'based on what was described, this would have to be a mistake, and an accident on the part of the humpback,' robbins concluded.
'he was just unlucky enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time,' corkeron conceded.
the humpback likely hoped it would get a mouthful of sand lance fish, which live in the waters off cape cod.
experts say whales are generally placid around humans, and show little aggression towards them.
but they have warned divers to stay at least 100 feet away from the powerful animals at all times, because even an accidental brush with one can be very dangerous as packard discovered.

by yew lun tianbeijing (reuters) china passed a wide-ranging law to counter foreign sanctions on thursday, in an apparent move to legalise its tit-for-tat retaliation against punitive actions taken by foreign countries over issues from human rights to hong kong.
the law, effective immediately, builds upon previous administrative counter-measures against foreign sanctions issued by the chinese foreign and commerce ministries.
it also lays out the scope of china's counter-sanctions.
who's the target?individuals or entities involved in the making or implementation of discriminatory measures against chinese citizens, or interfering with china's internal affairs could be put onto a blacklist, according to the full text of the law published on thursday.
blacklisted individuals could find their relatives, and the organisations of which they are senior managers or have control over placed on the list.
"relevant departments" in the chinese government can decide who to put on or remove from the blacklist.
what happens to those blacklisted?those blacklisted could be denied entry into china or deported from china.
their assets within china can be sealed, seized or frozen.
entities within china could be restricted from engaging in all forms of transactions or cooperation or other activities, potentially limiting the investment activities of blacklisted entities in china.
chinese citizens or organisations can sue in chinese courts those who enforce foreign measures that discriminate against them.
how is this different from the past?while the foreign ministry has previously announced sanctions mainly against individuals including western politicians and scholars, it had not cited a specific law as the legal basis.
it was also not always clear what those sanctions entailed.
although the commerce ministry has announced mechanisms targeted at foreign entities such as a so-called "unreliable entity list", there have been no known instances of companies being put on the list.
the new law combines many features of these administrative orders by the foreign and commerce ministries, such as allowing chinese companies to sue for compensation and denying entry to blacklisted persons.
beijing analysts say the new law makes china's sanctions appear less random, as it spells out who can be blacklisted and what the sanctions would entail.
what do supporters say?state media and experts in china said the new law was a long overdue "legal weapon" needed to deter the west from interfering in china's internal affairs.
all 14 vice-chairpersons of china's legislature who passed the law have been under u. s.  sanctions for passing the national security law last year that critics say has crippled political freedoms in hong kong.
in other measures, the united states issued a ban on cotton and tomato imports from china's western xinjiang region in january, citing human rights violations and the use of forced labour in the region.
wang jiangyu, a law professor at city university of hong kong, said the european union has a law the "blocking statute" to counter u. s.  sanctions, so china should not be faulted for having a similar law.
"the new law is the stick part of the carrot and stick diplomacy.
but it is defensive in nature, not offensive, and will only be used when other countries apply sanctions on us first," said cheng xiaohe, an associate professor of international studies at the renmin university of china.
what do critics say?foreign companies increasingly fear they will be used as sacrificial pawns in a game of political chess, said joerg wuttke, president of european union chamber of commerce.
chinese experts say the law could dampen the climate for foreign investment, but that the chinese government would have calculated this is a price worth paying to safeguard the country's interests.
(reporting by yew lun tian; editing by frances kerry)agnes chow hails from a generation of hong kong democracy activists who cut their teeth in politics as teenagers and are now being steadily silenced by china.
china's quick rollout of a law against foreign sanctions has left european and american companies shocked and facing "irreconcilable" compliance issues, two top business groups said friday, despite beijing saying the move would unlikely impact investment.

singapore singapore and australia will work towards putting in place an air travel bubble between the two countries, their prime ministers said on thursday (june 10), after more than a year of travel disruption caused by the pandemic.
"we discussed how two-way travel between singapore and australia can eventually resume, in a safe and calibrated manner, when both sides are ready," singapore leader lee hsien loong told a joint news conference with visiting australian counterpart scott morrison.
singapore had in march said the two nations were discussing plans for quarantine-free travel.
both singapore and australia have avoided the severe coronavirus outbreaks suffered by many counties, with total cases at just over 62,000 and 30,000 respectively.
lee said infrastructure and processes for resuming travel needed to be put in place, starting with mutual recognition of health and vaccination certificates.
"when all preparations are ready, then we can start small with an air travel bubble to build confidence on both sides," he said.
[[nid:526360]]morrison is the first foreign leader to make an official visit to the city-state since the start of the covid-19 pandemic last year.
he stopped in singapore on his way to britain for the g7 leaders' summit.
the leaders' discussions also included a potential fintech bridge and exploration of a green economy agreement.
morrison said he welcomed the countries working together to put the systems in place to enable a bubble to emerge between them.
however, he said: "there is still some time before we reach that milestone. "
singapore — a cyclist who punched a lorry driver after the latter confronted him with a flask on the road was fined $5,600 on thursday (10 june).
jeffery todd martin, a 57-year-old canadian, was caught in a widely shared video punching lorry driver zhang ping, who fell along jalan eunos.
martin pleaded guilty to one count of causing hurt to zhang, a 34-year-old chinese national, and one count of riding his bicycle in a disorderly manner without regard to safety of others.
zhang was dealt with separately, according to court documents, which did not state his punishment.
martin, a singapore permanent resident, was cycling ahead of zhang on the extreme left lane along jalan eunos on 24 february 2019.  zhang caught up with martin and overtook him from the right.
at about 10.
23am, as zhang was passing jalan awang, martin overtook him from the right side and cut in front.
martin turned around and pointed at zhang as he overtook him.
he continued cycling directly in front of zhang and stopped in the middle of the lane.
this forced zhang to stop his lorry despite the moving traffic.
martin alighted from his bicycle as zhang turned his lorry right.
he hit zhang's driver window and shouted vulgarities.
the canadian also shouted at zhang through the passenger window, prompting zhang to make a sharp left turn with his lorry towards martin.
the latter picked up his bicycle and took a few steps backwards to avoid the lorry.
martin placed his bicycle at a nearby grass patch while zhang alighted from his lorry and followed martin with an orange water flask in hand.
zhang stood in front of martin and gesticulated in the direction of his lorry, but without warning, martin punched the right side of zhang's mouth.
the force caused zhang to fall backwards on the road of jalan eunos.
martin then retrieved his bicycle and continued cycling along jalan eunos in the direction of still road.
a resident living in the vicinity attended to zhang, who moved to sit on the pavement as he felt dizzy.
zhang was later found to have superficial facial lacerations.
his medical expenses cost $126, which zhang's employer bore.
martin paid full compensation to zhang's employer on 21 april.
the acts were captured on zhang's in-car camera and by an eyewitness who recorded a video.
martin had previously fractured his collarbone in a previous incident and thus felt aggrieved when zhang drove close to him, said martin's lawyer suppiah thangaveloo.
the lawyer highlighted three instances when zhang came close to hitting martin, including when zhang reversed against martin, and his sudden swing to the left.
thangaveloo pointed out that his client did not actually confront zhang any further and took his bicycle to walk off, but zhang confronted him with a flask.
martin reacted instinctively with a punch before moving off, said the lawyer, who asked for a fine of between $3,000 and $4,000.

tokyo [japan], june 11 (ani): japanese prime minister yoshihide suga referred to taiwan as a country, drawing a sharp reaction from beijing which regards the self-ruled island as its 'inalienable part'.
in his first one-on-one parliamentary debate with opposition leaders wednesday, suga, naming australia, new zealand and taiwan, said, "such three countries have been imposing strong restrictions on privacy rights" to curb the novel coronavirus outbreak, kyodo news reported.
self-governed taiwan is usually called a "region" in japan.
beijing claims full sovereignty over taiwan, a democracy of almost 24 million people located off the southeastern coast of mainland china, despite the fact that the two sides have been governed separately for more than seven decades.
taipei, on the other hand, has countered the chinese aggression by increasing strategic ties with democracies including the us, which has been repeatedly opposed by beijing.
china has threatened that "taiwan's independence" means war.
suga's reference came as tokyo and beijing have already been at odds over several issues, including a territorial dispute in the east china sea and the crackdown on hong kong.
"china expresses strong dissatisfaction with japan's erroneous remarks and has lodged a solemn protest against japan," foreign ministry spokesman wang wenbin told reporters in beijing on thursday.
"there is only one china in the world," wang said, urging japan to become more cautious in words and deeds on taiwan affairs and to avoid sending wrong signals to the island's independence forces.
suga's government has been strengthening its commitment to democratic taiwan.
recently, japan donated over 1.
2 million covid-19 doses to taiwan, as the island faces a spike in covid-19 cases.
china has also lambasted japan for donating vaccines, labelling such a move as a "political performance".
at his summit in washington in april, suga with us president joe biden acknowledged "the importance of peace and stability across the taiwan strait. "
it marked the first time in 52 years that japanese and u. s.  leaders have mentioned taiwan in a joint statement.

michael packard, 56, was on his second dive of the day looking for lobsters in cape code, a peninsula in the us state of massachusetts, on the southeast coast.
his vessel "ja'n j" was sitting just off popular herring cove beach alongside a fleet of other boats fishing for striped bass.
the method behind commercial lobster diving is collecting lobsters from the sandy bottom.
and, 45ft (14 metres) deep, is where the father-of-two had his terrifying encounter with the humpback whale.
he told cape cod times: "all of a sudden, i felt this huge shove and the next thing i knew it was completely black.
"i could sense i was moving, and i could feel the whale squeezing with the muscles in his mouth. "
at first, mr packard thought he had been swallowed by a great white shark.
but he could not feel any teeth and did not notice any serious injuries.
it was then that he realised he was inside a whale.
he added: "i was completely inside; it was completely black.
i thought to myself, 'there's no way i'm getting out of here.
i'm done, i'm dead.
'"all i could think of was my boys — they're 12 and 15 years old.

"mr packard, who lives in welfleet, was taken to cape cod hospital in hyannis.
he was discharged on friday with what he described as "a lot of soft tissue damage" but no broken bones.
despite the scare, mr packard intends to return to work as soon as he recovers.

'genocide and crimes against humanity', erosion of 'democratic norms' cited by washington in call with beijing.
united states secretary of state antony blinken in a phone call with china's top diplomat again voiced us concerns about the "ongoing genocide and ethnic cleansing" against muslim uigurs in china's far western region of xinjiang and "the deterioration of democratic norms" under china's rule in hong kong.
secretary blinken spoke on friday with yang jiechi, the chinese communist party's top foreign affairs officer, to discuss a range of thorny issues confronting the two major powers including north korea's nuclear programme, a state department spokesman said.
blinken's comments to yang follows the release on june 10 of a report by amnesty international showing xinjiang has become a "dystopian hellscape" where uighurs and other predominantly muslim ethnic minorities face systematic and state-organised "mass internment and torture amounting to crimes against humanity".
blinken's conversation with yang further comes as challenges posed by china figure in discussions now under way among leaders of the group of seven industrialised democracies in the united kingdom and attended by president joe biden.
china has cracked down on pro-democracy advocates in hong kong, a former british colony returned to chinese rule in 1997 under an agreed principle of "one china, two systems" that was to have allowed continuing democratic freedoms in hong kong.
in addition to "the need for the united states and the prc to work together for the denuclearization of the korean peninsula," blinken and yang discussed other "shared global challenges" including iran, myanmar and the climate crisis, state department spokesman ned price said in a statement.
blinken called for more "cooperation and transparency" from chinese authorities in the world health organization's continuing inquiries into the origin of the covid-19 virus.
on the call, yang expressed to blinken beijing's serious concern that some people in the us were spreading the "absurd story" about the coronavirus escaping from a wuhan laboratory, chinese state media said.
beijing firmly opposed what yang called "abominable actions" over the pandemic, which he said were being used to slander china, state broadcaster cctv said, according to the reuters news service.
the us's top diplomat called on beijing to "cease its pressure campaign against taiwan and peacefully resolve cross-strait issues", price said.
yang told blinken that washington should handle taiwan-related issues "carefully and appropriately," cctv reported.
washington should work with beijing to put ties "back on track," yang said, according to cctv.
the us and china have been engaged in an increasingly tense diplomatic exchange since blinken and yang met face-to-face in alaska in march.
at the time, the us expressed "deep concerns" about actions by china, and china pushed back as "firmly opposed to us interference in china's internal affairs".
bonnie glaser, an asia expert at the german marshall fund think-tank, told reuters that although the agenda included potential areas of cooperation, the conversation appeared dominated by contentious issues.
she said yang's call for washington to work with beijing to put ties "back on track" indicated that china was still putting the onus on the us for the problems in the relationship.
notwithstanding the diplomatic tensions, china's largest ride-hailing company, didi chuxing, filed on thursday for an initial public offering of stock on us financial markets in what is expected to be the world's biggest ipo this year, reuters reported.
the company is backed by asia's largest technology investment firms – softbank, alibaba and tencent.
sources familiar with the matter told reuters that it could raise around $10bn and seek a valuation of close to $100bn.
at that valuation, didi's listing would be the biggest chinese share offering in the us since alibaba raised $25bn in 2014. activists arrested and as many as 7,000 police to be deployed after annual vigil banned for a second year.

singapore — upset at a private hire car driver who sounded his horn and made a gesture, a man drove quickly to catch up and confront him.
marco paulo goncalves guimaraes, a 43-year-old portuguese, was jailed three weeks and fined $1,000 on thursday (10 june) after he pleaded guilty to one count of causing hurt to desmond wu weiming, and one count of not wearing a mask while arguing with wu.
guimaraes was also ordered to pay compensation of $122.
20 to the private hire car driver by end july.
a singapore permanent resident, guimaraes came to singapore in 2004 and founded football management international in 2010.  he began a career as a fifa licensed players' agent where he scouted for and helped to place promising players into european football clubs, according to his lawyer marshall lim from invictus law.
guimaraes was actively scouting for talent in malaysia and singapore to bring to portugal to experience football, but the covid-19 pandemic dealt a severe blow to his work, said lim.
he is struggling to manage the business and his club algarve clube de futbol while supporting his wife and his two daughters, lim said.
on 11 june last year, guimaraes was on his way to pick up one of his daughters from school when he got into the road rage incident.
his wife was beside him in the front passenger seat.
at about 1.
10pm, wu was driving along punggol drive, a two-lane road, when guimaraes overtook him.
guimaraes' car appeared to brake abruptly.
when wu passed by guimaraes' car, wu sounded his horn and gestured at him.
guimaraes drove quickly to catch up with wu and both cars stopped side-by-side at a loading bay at block 670a edgefield plains.
guimaraes alighted and approached wu's car while not wearing a mask.
singapore was in phase 1 of its reopening then and all were required to wear their masks in public spaces with some exceptions.
the portuguese then pushed the car door against wu, causing it to hit wu's right shin.
he then grabbed wu's right wrist and began arguing with him.
after wu emerged from his car, guimaraes pushed him while hurling profanities at him.
wu recorded guimaraes with his mobile phone, and the latter then wore a mask.
guimaraes then slapped wu on the side of his head and pushed his right arm.
he returned to his car and drove to a parking lot at a nearby loading bay, while wu called the police.
wu parked his car behind guimaraes' and both alighted, with guimaraes kicking wu on his left shin.
wu sought medical treatment at a hospital and was diagnosed with bruises and swelling over both shins, and over his left ear.
according to lim, guimaraes had been driving cautiously due to heavy traffic and had not been able to filter to the left lane as it was full of vehicles.
this was when wu had sounded his horn at guimaraes.
when guimaraes managed to filter left, wu "inexplicably sounded his vehicle horn at our client, despite our client having already gotten out of mr wu's way", said lim.
"our client instructs that as mr wu drove past, he raised his hand, and our client perceived that mr wu had pointed his middle finger at him as he drove past.
this was unwarranted conduct from mr wu, bearing in mind that our client had given way to mr wu, and did not respond to mr wu's sounding of his horn at our client as he cautiously navigated edgefield plains.
asking for two weeks' jail and a fine of $800, lim said, "our client therefore could not fathom what caused mr.  wu to act in such a rude manner.

carbis bay, england: us president joe biden said on thursday (jun 10) that adonation of 500 million doses of the pfizer covid-19 vaccineto the world's poorest countries would supercharge the battle with the virus and comes with "no strings attached".
biden, speaking alongside pfizer chief executive albert bourla in the english seaside resort of carbis bay ahead of a g7 summit, thanked other leaders for recognising their responsibility to vaccinate the world.
"the united states is providing these half billion doses with no strings attached.
no strings attached," biden said.
"our vaccine donations don't include pressure for favours, or potential concessions.
we're doing this to save lives.
"biden, keen to burnish his multilateral credentials on his first foreign trip as leader, cast the donation as a bold move that showed america recognised its responsibility to the world and to its own citizens.
"america will be the arsenal of vaccines in our fight against covid-19, just as america was the arsenal of democracy during world war two," biden said.
the largest ever vaccine donation by a single country will cost the united states us$3.
5 billion but willspur further donations from other g7 leaders- including british prime minister boris johnson.
g7 leaders want to vaccinate the world by the end of 2022 to try to halt the covid-19 pandemic that has killed more than 3.
9 million people, devastated the global economy and upended the normal lives of billions of people.
vaccination efforts so far are heavily correlated with wealth: the united states, europe, israel and bahrain are far ahead of other countries.
a total of 2.
2 billion people have been vaccinated so far out of a world population of nearly 8 billion, based on johns hopkins university data.
'save lives'us drugmaker pfizer and its german partner biontech have agreed to supply the us with the vaccines, delivering 200 million doses in 2021 and 300 million doses in the first half of 2022. the shots, which will be produced at pfizer's us sites, will be supplied at a not-for-profit price.
around 100 countries will get the shots.
pfizer ceo bourla said the eyes of the world were on the leaders of rich nations to see if they would act to solve the covid-19 crisis and share with poorer nations.
"this announcement with the us government gets us closer to our goal and significantly enhances our ability to save even more lives across the globe," he said.
while such a large donation of vaccines was welcomed by many, there were immediately calls for the richest nations of the world to open up more of their giant hoards of vaccines.
anti-poverty campaign group oxfam called for more to be done to increase global production of vaccines.
"surely, these 500 million vaccine doses are welcome as they will help more than 250 million people, but that's still a drop in the bucket compared to the need across the world," said niko lusiani, oxfam america's vaccine lead.
"we need a transformation toward more distributed vaccine manufacturing so that qualified producers worldwide can produce billions more low-cost doses on their own terms, without intellectual property constraints," he said in a statement.
another issue, especially in some poor countries, is the infrastructure for transporting the vaccines which often have to be stored at very cold temperatures.
ip waiverbiden has also backed calls for awaiver of some vaccine intellectual property rightsbut there is no international consensus yet on how to proceed.
the new vaccine donations come on top of 80 million doses washington has already pledged to donate by the end of june.
there is also us$2 billion in funding earmarked for the covax programme led by the world health organization (who) and the global alliance for vaccines and immunization (gavi), the white house said.

washington is also taking steps to support local production of covid-19 vaccines in other countries, including through its quad initiative with japan, india and australia.

it's a matter of great concern as cases of racial discrimination and intolerance continue to rise.
in another shocking incident, an indian-singaporean took to facebook to share how his chinese-singaporean neighbour misbehaved while he was praying.
this incident follows just days after a chinese man was caught on camera making derogatory remarks towards an interracial couple.
screengrab: facebookindian-singaporean, livanesh ramu, shared a video of the incident on facebook and described what transpired.
in the video– which has now been shared by 1.
7k users– he can be seen using a handheld prayer bell.
but just as he steps out for prayer, his chinese neighbour barges into the frame and disturbs ramu's prayer by loudly beating a dong.
in his post, ramu described, "like many other hindus, this has been a part of our family's 5-minute, twice a week prayer routine.
having lived in this home for more than 20 years we never had any issues.
i guess with covid we have a new norm.
"soon after posting the video, he received several supportive messages from singaporeans, most of whom lauded him for his calmness.
while others pointed that the lady was a minority in the largely racially equitable island nation.
screengrab: facebookone user wrote, "this is disrespectful and downright shameful on that lady.
and the look on her face!!!!
epic"another user wondered why people have become far less considerate today.
she questioned, "i have a neighbour like u also indian.
.
.
it's normal.
.
.
it's their ritual n religion.
.
not so loud they ring the bell.
is juz less than 8mins then they are done.
.
y can't the lady be more considerate?
"thankfully, the video managed to reach the police just in time, who intervened and are now working with ramu to sort the matter.
as he later added to his post, "the singapore police force has reached out to us.
we are coordinating with them at the moment.
"while this incident has shed light on the menace of racism in singapore, it is not the reality of this progressive island nation.
most singaporeans, especially young parents, are raising their children to become more educated on such subjects and of course, open to all belief systems and cultures.
as roshni mahtani cheung, group ceo & founder, theasianparent, puts it, "i am not sure what triggered the woman to act out in such a manner – but as a country, we singaporeans need to be more tolerant and not get so agitated by small things.
""for those of us who are parents, we need to check our own behaviour.
ask ourselves if we are doing enough to expose our child to different cultures, religions and belief systems," adds the young mum.
not just local singaporeans, but expats in singapore also believe that this is a one off incident and doesn't reflect singapore's inclusivity.
"i have never faced any such issues.
in fact, i have always been welcomed and felt safe being in singapore.
the current issues are one of cases.
it doesn't represent the community here and i am fortunate to be allowed to stay in this country with my family," shared vineeth kallarakkal, head of marketing, theasianparent.
kallarakkal has been living in singapore for eight years now and is originally from india.
although this unfortunate incident has highlighted the need for more awareness, we cannot overlook the promptness of singapore police force that further proves the sanctity of racism laws in singapore.
from the penal code to the protection from harassment act, singapore has a range of laws to guard citizens against racism.
in fact, these laws can also be invoked even if there was no intention to hurt racial or religious feelings.
the laws apply to comments made online and also when a non-verbal gesture was made in public.
according to the straits times report, lawyers note that other than racial enmity laws, authorities can investigate such actions under the protection from harassment act and the sedition act.
there are also other provisions in the penal code which may apply, such as public nuisance.
these rules are proof that those who harass fellow citizens not only take the law into their own hands but also instil fear.
so the best possible solution to this issue is that we must teach ourselves and our future generations to spread love and not hatred.
let's make this a safer place for everybody and continue to live in harmony.

singapore singaporeans studying in australian institutions are looking forward to a proposed travel bubble between the two countries, as they may finally be able to return to their campuses there or spend holidays with their families here.
prime minister lee hsien loong and his australian counterpart scott morrison said on thursday that the two countries are working towards an air travel bubble.
they hoped singapore students in australia, whose studies have been disrupted by the covid-19 travel restrictions, would be the first to get the opportunity to travel under the arrangement.
all six students the straits times spoke to on friday (june 11) expressed optimism about the travel bubble.
for first-year students like mr chris gan, who is doing his bachelor's degree in politics, philosophy and economics at the australian national university, it will be his first chance to set foot on its campus.
the 21-year-old said he was not too concerned that the travel bubble may be one-way.
"i am confident singaporeans will be able to travel to australia too.
"mr sun yuchen, 23, a third-year student at the university of melbourne who is currently on a year's leave of absence, is looking forward to returning to campus.
"i see a chance for me to return to australia to complete my studies and gain experience by using actual facilities the school provides," he said.
singaporeans who are currently in australia, such as university of new south wales student joseph tan, look forward to reuniting with family here.
the 23-year-old, who has been in australia since february last year, said he had been unable to return home, as his degree in aviation requires him to attend flying lessons there.
he added: "the travel bubble between singapore and australia comes as a relief to me as i have the opportunity to finally return home and see my family after being away for so long.
even if i can only return for a few days, it is comforting to return home again.
"students who returned to singapore when the covid-19 pandemic worsened said the past year had been tough for them.
psychology student audrey chan, 23, is a final-year student at the university of queensland.
she has been continuing her classes remotely since returning to singapore in march last year.
she said: "my singaporean and malaysian peers agree that we often feel like an outsider or a cctv spying on the class via zoom, and this makes class participation painfully awkward and hard for us.
some of us are stressed out, as we find it hard to keep up with the class, especially when technology fails us.
"university of adelaide student shalynn tsai, 21, who is doing her bachelor's degree in dental surgery, had to take leave of absence because she was unable to return to campus by mid-september last year.
"it has been very stressful not knowing when or whether we can even continue with our degree courses," she said.
"with the travel bubble, we can finally go back and resume our studies.
"while the students understand that they may need to undergo pre-departure and arrival tests for the coronavirus, they hoped they would not have to incur hefty charges and would not have to be quarantined if already vaccinated.
mr ryan soh, 21, will be commencing his communication studies at queensland university of technology later this month.
"i hope that there will be no need for a quarantine once vaccination has been done and the covid-19 test comes back negative.
kind of like what's going on between new zealand and australia," he said.
"nevertheless, if there is a need for quarantine, then hopefully it would be more accessible or cheaper for students, as some of us may not be able to afford it.
"mr tan felt the same.
"hopefully it will not be too expensive and there will not be a need to self-quarantine for too long once i arrive at either destination.
i understand the need for the covid-19 tests to ensure there are no imported cases and hope that both countries can maintain the safety of not only its residents but those travelling as well," he said.

china's quick rollout of a law against foreign sanctions has left european and american companies shocked and facing "irreconcilable" compliance issues, two top business groups said friday, despite beijing saying the move would unlikely impact investment.
the law came into effect on thursday, adding to china's toolbox as it builds its defences against us and eu pressure over trade and human rights.
the move also came just a week after us president joe biden expanded a blacklist of chinese companies in which americans are not allowed to invest -- allowing beijing to now hit back at those who formulate or comply with foreign sanctions.
"european companies in china are shocked by the lack of transparency and speed of this process," european chamber president joerg wuttke told afp, referring to the passing of the new law.
with the fresh rules prohibiting organisations from implementing what beijing deems discriminatory and restrictive measures, "foreign firms remain very much stuck between a rock and a hard place," he said.
american chamber of commerce chairman greg gilligan cautioned that the new law "presents potentially irreconcilable compliance problems for foreign companies".
rushing through a new law without an opportunity for public comment severely jeopardises foreign investor confidence in china's legal system as well, he added.
but chinese foreign ministry spokesman wang wenbin told a regular press briefing on friday he did not see a definite link between the new law and foreign investment.
"if anything, the enactment of the anti-foreign sanctions law provides a predictable legal environment.

for foreign companies operating in china," he said.
wuttke, however, warned that the action was not conducive to attracting investment, or in reassuring companies that "already feel they may be used as sacrificial pawns in a game of political chess".
"there is a real concern that this will further destabilise eu-china relations," he said.
in the european chamber's latest business confidence survey released this week, 41 per cent of respondents said china's business environment had become more politicised last year.
most reported they expect the situation to remain the same or deteriorate over the coming year.

china's top legislative body has passed an anti-sanctions law , providing legal backing for sweeping retaliation against any individuals, their families and organisations responsible for imposing foreign sanctions against the country.
the legislation was passed on thursday at the closing session of the national people's congress (npc) standing committee, and was effective the same day.
tam yiu chung, hong kong's sole delegate to the npc standing committee, said that under the new law, the state council and its agencies would be responsible for coordinating retaliatory measures.
"these measures can be applied to organisations and individuals, as well as extended to the individuals' spouses, relatives and the organisations that they belong to," he said.
[embed]https://youtu.
be/z5nydpsky0a[/embed]tam said that under article 6 of the new law, beijing's retaliatory measures could include denial of visa applications or entry into china.
in the case of visa holders, authorities could declare their document invalid and deport them.
individuals' property or assets could be frozen or seized, and institutions could be restricted from conducting transactions with individuals or organisations targeted, he said.
the law also specified that no one in the country could help other countries implement measures against china, and people must instead help beijing's authorities to execute retaliatory measures.
individuals and organisations affected by sanctions could make claims in mainland courts, tam said.
state media said the move was intended to provide a legal basis for china to respond to sanctions.
china has issued counter-sanctions in response to sanctions against it from the united states, the european union, britain and canada over beijing's political crackdown in hong kong and treatment of ethnic minority groups in xinjiang .
after the law was passed, li zhanshu, head of the npc standing committee, said : "china will not give up its legitimate interest.
and no one should have any illusion of letting china swallow the bitter fruit that harms our own interests.
"chinese foreign ministry spokesman wang wenbin said the passage of the new law showed china's determination to protect its sovereignty and core interests, and would not affect its relations with other countries.
[[nid:495641]]the anti-sanctions law was announced on monday night by state media and underwent a second reading but skipped a third, in the same way the national security law for hong kong went through the legislative process.
the new law is the strongest tool so far for china to respond to foreign sanctions, after the ministry of commerce in january issued a "blocking statute" requiring chinese companies to report foreign restrictions on economic or trade activities.
it had last september unveiled an unreliable entity list for foreign businesses.
washington has imposed a number of sanctions on china over its policies in hong kong and xinjiang, including targeting hong kong's leader carrie lam cheng yuet ngor and xinjiang 's communist party chief chen quanguo, as well as other senior mainland and hong kong officials and the 14 vice-chairpersons of the npc.
canada, britain and the european union also imposed sanctions on china.
tian feilong, an associate professor at beihang university's law school, has been involved in the consultations over the new legislation.
he said the draft of the law was first read in april, after the us senate committee on foreign relations backed an act to counter competition from china.
he said discussion about the law started last year when donald trump was still us president, but china was waiting to see how trump's successor, joe biden , would approach relations with china.
"the central leadership was already considering it last year, and the academic community has made suggestions," he said.
"the timing is based on biden's china policies.
"[embed]https://youtu.
be/ufqdggczq9c[/embed]tam said it was not specified in the legislation whether the new law would apply to hong kong and macau through local legislation.
"for a mainland law to apply in hong kong, it needs to be inserted into annex iii of the basic law .
.
.
but the new law did not mention how the law would be applied outside the mainland," he said.
"i would not say that it could not be applied in hong kong either.
probably the mainland authorities need more time to study its application.
"[[nid:518182]]tam, who is also sanctioned by the us for the enactment of the national security law in hong kong, which critics say has undermined the city's autonomy, said he supported the new law but had no plan to invoke any provision in it himself.
"i have not yet considered how this law will help me," he said.
"i just think that from the macro level, it is good to have this law so that it's not just individual agencies or the central government [making] retaliatory measures, but the responsibility of the state council as a whole.
"i support this law because as the chinese saying goes, 'offend no one if none offends you, but retaliate if you are under attack.
'"there have been concerns among foreign companies over the lack of transparency around the legislative process and the potential impact on businesses in china and hong kong, which analysts say will need to be wary of being linked to foreign entities under chinese sanctions.
greg gilligan, chairman of the american chamber of commerce in china, said it was difficult to comment on the law until details were available.
"however, where there is any disagreement across borders, governments need to come together to reconcile this in a way that allows businesses to remain legally compliant within the jurisdictions in which they operate," he said.

source: nurul fatimah iskandar (@_new_rule_) / instagramon the heels of the suspension of the ngee ann polytechnic lecturer who was caught on video making racist remarks to an interracial couple from his teaching duties, a former student of his took to social media to share her own experience of being subject to islamophobic remarks from him in front of a class.
ms nurul fatimah binti iskandar, who was a student of mr tan boon lee for an object oriented programming module in 2017, said in an instagram post on wednesday (9 june) that the lecturer had "used our class period to have a full-on discourse about islam".
"i was the only muslim in class.
he opened websites on the projector, pointing out things he didn't agree with about the quran and prophet muhammad s. a. w to the class," she said.
based on ms nurul's record of an instagram story posted on 28 july 2017, the date of the incident, among the comments mr tan had reportedly made were "only animals will treat their children like how allah does to his people" and "what type of father tells you to worship him five times a day and threatens to send you to hell if you don't?".
such remarks, she said, were merely "the tip of the iceberg".
to worsen matters, mr tan had singled out ms nurul — who was sitting in the front of the class — and asked her if she agreed with him.
"i could barely open my mouth amidst his continuous sweeping statements.
i was barely 17, fresh out of 10 years of madrasah trying to assimilate into the new secular environment," she lamented.
the situation had "escalated so badly" that ms nurul ended up sitting outside on the floor of the corridor with her classmate, merick while waiting for his "unsettling speech" to end.
merick had initiated the walk-out, according to ms nurul.
ms nurul noted that she made a complaint regarding the incident with mr tan, but no action was taken.
touching on why she went public with her story after mr tan's identity was revealed in the recent viral case, ms nurul said that she "can only imagine how many more times he had been racist and islamophobic in the institution of education over the years".
"after his suspension is over, he might return to the classrooms.
he should not be allowed back," she stressed.
"a racist islamophobe has no place educating our youths.
"particularly taking into consideration mr tan's position as a senior lecturer, it is crucial that such instances of bigotry are thwarted from the start to prevent "strife, prejudice, and racism" resulting from the spread of "sweeping misconceptions" about a particular faith, said ms nurul.
"my ex-classmates did their best to help me find evidence.
more people are coming out to testify.
more people are showing support.
we may still be far from utopia but the fact people are thinking, trying and taking action means we are definitely on the right path," she concluded.
a post shared by nurul fatimah binti iskandar (@_new_rule_)in the recent viral video, mr tan had publicly accused mr dave parkash of "preying on chinese girls" while the latter was on a night out with his girlfriend.
mr dave clarified that he is half-indian and half-filipino, while his girlfriend — who recorded the incident — is half-chinese and half-thai.
undeterred by mr dave's reply, the man continued his verbal abuse against mr dave, saying: "i got nothing against you staying in singapore.
""the only thing is you are preying on chinese girl, i tell you the chinese won't like it," while admitting that he himself is "racist".
the man also accused mr dave's girlfriend of "disgracing me", saying that the interracial couple should date people of their own race instead.
"you don't see a chinese guy preying on an indian girl," he further said to mr dave.
mr tan teaches at np's school of engineering.
he appears to have been awarded the long service medal in 2019 under the annual national day awards, as listed on prime minister's office website.
an np spokesperson told channel news asia on monday that the polytechnic is aware of the video and has suspended him from teaching duties.
"we regret that the individual in question is a member of our staff," said the spokesperson.
they added that the polytechnic takes "a very serious view" of the matter, as the remarks are "highly offensive, disrespectful and go against our staff code of conduct and values as a community".
"we are investigating this matter internally, including considering the appropriate disciplinary action to be taken.
meanwhile, the staff in question has been suspended from his teaching duties," the spokesperson added.
the incident is currently under police investigations.
the police confirmed on sunday that reports had been lodged and that a 60-year-old man was assisting with investigations into the incident.

source: the sun dailykuala lumpur, malaysia — the united malays national organisation (umno) is opposed to any extension of the current state of emergency in malaysia, says party president ahmad zahid hamidi after an audience with king al-sultan abdullah on friday (11 june).
ahmad zahid told reporters outside the national palace here today that he had mooted the prospect during his hour-long audience with sultan abdullah "to ensure the country's democratic system is defended".
"it was obvious that even without the emergency, the government could previously handle matters related to fighting the covid-19 pandemic," he added.
while calling for an end to the emergency, the bagan datuk member of parliament (mp) also proposed the resumption of parliament sittings.
"umno believes that parliament is an important official platform to voice the people's concerns (on matters such) such as loan moratoriums, i-sinar and i-lestari 2.
0 and other forms of assistance for everyone," he said.
ahmad zahid is one of several politicians who have openly spoken up against the state of emergency and the suspension of parliament, the latter of which is enabled by the former.
parti keadilan rakyat president anwar ibrahim in january filed a suit against muhyiddin and the federal government, on the grounds that the latter had allegedly advised the nation's king to suspend parliament sittings during the state of emergency.
malay mail reported that in a separate statement filed in court, anwar had argued that the suspension of parliament under emergency powers blocks parliament's freedom to ensure transparent debates, government accountability, and proper checks and balances on the executive branch of the government in making and enacting laws during the pandemic.
anwar was also one of the politicians who have met with the king this week.
he was granted an audience with sultan abdullah with parti amanah negara president mohamad sabu and democratic action party (dap) secretary-general lim guan eng — all component parties of the pakatan harapan coalition.
former prime minister mahathir mohamad, whose parti pejuang tanah air political party has yet to be registered, also had a meeting with the king, during which he proposed the setting up of a national operations council (mageran) in the present circumstances.
mageran was set up after the 13 may racial riots in 1969 to restore the rule of law and order in the country.
several political leaders have since challenged dr mahathir's proposal to establish mageran.
ahmad zahid told reporters that the idea of mageran should have been brought forth at the start of the emergency period.
he added that he did not discuss the mageran issue with the king.
"i feel it is something normal outside the scope of the existing situation because the emergency is supposed to cover it but it has been used to achieve other purposes," said ahmad zahid.
in a joint statement on friday, anwar, mohamad sabu, and lim said that their objection is grounded in their belief that for a parliamentary democracy to truly function, the emergency must be lifted and parliament must be allowed to reconvene.
"the solution to the people's problems in relation to covid-19, the economy and even politics requires a democracy that functions well, and the best avenue to hear out their grievances and to find solutions to them is parliament," they said.
klang mp charles santiago also called for the end of the emergency and for parliament sittings to resume via both physical and virtual means.
in a tweet on friday, the dap politician wrote: "don't make a mockery of parliamentary democracy.
end emergency, reconvene parliament via physical & virtual sessions.
"santiago also expressed his objection against mageran in the same tweet, saying: "no to noc.
"don't make a mockery of parliamentary democracy.
end emergency, reconvene parliament via physical & virtual sessions.
no to noc.
— charles santiago (@mpklang) june 11, 2021prime minister muhyiddin yassin in march defended the emergency proclamation, stating that it is not a tool for him to cling on to his position but a pre-emptive move in managing the covid-19 situation in the country.
the emergency would be lifted earlier than its scheduled end on 1 august if the government is able to control the pandemic situation in the country, he added.
"if the independent special committee says [the emergency] can be put to an end earlier, i will just follow that.
we also do not want to be under restriction by such regulations forever," said muhyiddin.
sultan abdullah is slated to discuss the emergency and the covid-19 situation with eight other rulers in a special conference next wednesday (16 june).
the king's succession of physical meetings with political leaders this week is set to end on friday.
he is slated to have a virtual meeting with sarawak's ruling party gabungan parti sarawak on monday.

beijing (reuters) china's government said on friday (june 11) it welcomed taiwanese to come and get vaccinated against covid-19.
it also called on taiwan to remove obstacles and allow its people to receive chinese vaccines which it says are highly effective.
china claims democratically ruled taiwan as its own territory and has repeatedly offered to send vaccines to the island, which is battling a spike in domestic infections but has expressed concern about the safety of chinese shots and has not cleared them for use.
china's taiwan affairs office said in a statement that two chinese-made vaccines had been granted emergency use authorisation by the world health organisation and its shots were in use or approved by more than 90 countries, showing their safety and efficacy.
taiwan people can come to china to get vaccinated against covid-19, provided they strictly comply with china's pandemic control measures, the office said.
it urged taiwan's government to "quickly remove artificial obstacles for mainland vaccines being sent to taiwan and allow the broad mass of taiwan compatriots to receive the safe and highly effective mainland vaccines".
about 62,000 taiwanese had been vaccinated in china as of may 31, the office added, though many taiwanese live and work there already.
only 3 per cent of taiwan's 23.
5 million people have received at least one shot, though millions of doses are on order.
japan donated 1.
24 million astrazeneca shots last week and the united states has pledged 750,000 doses, which have yet to arrive.
still, china's offer is not likely to be attractive to many taiwanese.
a poll by taipei's national chengchi university last month showed that most people would not be willing to get a chinese vaccine.
a taiwan security official looking into chinese activities told reuters that the offer was another example of a beijing influence campaign to sway public opinion on the island.
"this could be attractive for some people, but the problem is not many people can afford the costs," the official said, pointing to the expense and weeks in quarantine needed to travel between taiwan and china.

italy got their euro 2020 campaign off the mark with an impressive 3-0 win over turkey in the curtain-raiser for the postponed continental tournament in front of their home fans in rome on friday.
playing their first major tournament in five years after failing to qualify for the 2018 world cup, all the goals came in the second half in front of a stadio olimpico that was filled to a quarter of its capacity.
merih demiral's own goal put italy ahead before ciro immobile and lorenzo insigne netted for roberto mancini's side in the group a opener.
the win capped an emotional night in the italian capital which saw 16,000 fans return to the stadio olimpico.
"it was important to start well in rome and i think it's a satisfaction for the public and for italians," said mancini, whose side are now on a 28-match unbeaten run.
"there was a lot of help from the crowd.
it was a beautiful evening, i hope there are many others, but there are still six more for wembley.
""we were hoping for another result, but italy was dominant," said turkey coach senol gunes.
"the first goal changed things in the second half and we lost control of the game.
"there was a party atmosphere, with a spectacular sound and light show and firework display before kick-off for the opening of the month-long 24-team event, which will be played across 11 countries.
there was a performance by the italian national police orchestra, a parade of huge inflatable balloons on the pitch, tenor andrea bocelli sang 'nessun dorma' before a virtual performance from martin garrix, bono and the edge.
former italy world cup winners alessandro nesta and francesco totti, who played for lazio and roma during their careers at the stadio olimpico, carried the ball to the centre of the pitch before kick-off.
berardi impresses -on the pitch, italy dominated early on with a three-man attack led by immobile, who plays for lazio.
the 31-year-old had several near misses in the first half, coming up against a solid turkey defence who held their own.
turkey could also thank goalkeeper ugurcan cakir for pulling off a big save on 23 minutes, tipping over italy captain giorgio chiellini's powerful goal-bound header off an insigne corner.
italy finally got on the scoreboard eight minutes after the break when the unfortunate demiral found himself in the path of a federico berardi cross for immobile, the juventus defender bundling the ball into his own net.
leonardo spinazzola had a chance for a second minutes later, with immobile sending the rebound wide.
immobile finally got his goal, his 14th for italy, and first in a major tournament, in the 66th minute, scoring from a rebound after cakir had saved from spinazzola.
and insigne curled in the third with 11 minutes to go.
sassuolo winger berardi had a role in all three goals, with italy scoring three for the first time in a european championship match.
all three italy forwards proved efficient on the night with a defence organised around juventus veterans chiellini and leonardo bonucci holding firm, securing a ninth straight clean sheet.
"we struggled at the start, we tried to accelerate but we hit a wall," said immobile.
"in the second half, they were a little more tired, they tried to rush us but the spaces opened up, and we saw our quality at that time.
"gianluigi donnarumma was largely unworried in the italy goal apart from a dangerous burak yilmaz cross after half an hour and a solo run by cengiz under after coming off the bench after the break.
"from a tactical point of view, italy was superior," said gunes.
"italy mastered the pitch and the ball.
they suffocated us with pressing and high pace, and they took advantage of playing at home.
"we have to react now.

singapore: students from singapore could be given priority to travel to australia to pursue or complete their studies when the infrastructure for safe travel is in place, said australian prime minister scott morrison on thursday (jun 10).
speaking at a joint press conference with mr morrison following the in-person leaders' meeting that took place earlier on thursday, prime minister lee hsien loong said the two discussed how two-way travel between the countries can eventually resume in a safe and calibrated manner "when both sides are ready".
this can "start small" with an air travel bubble "when ready", said mr lee in his statement, which was broadcast live on his facebook page.
"we need to prepare the infrastructure and processes to get ready to do this.
it starts with mutual recognition of health and vaccination certificates, possibly in a digital form.
when all the preparations are ready, we can start small with an air travel bubble to build confidence on both sides," he added.
there is still some time before singapore and australia "reach that milestone", but the two countries will be "getting on with the job" of putting systems in place that will enable such a bubble to emerge between singapore and australia, similar to the one between australia and new zealand, said mr morrison.
"but in addition to that .
.
.
giving priority to students from singapore to be able to return to australia to complete their studies and to engage in their studies," he added.
"and for the students from singapore .
.
.
a first opportunity to see increased travel between australia and singapore realised, and for that to occur sooner rather than later.
"this is the sixth singapore-australia leaders' meeting.
mr lee and mr morrison held their previous meeting in march last year by video conference because of the covid-19 pandemic.
mr morrison's trip to singapore is the first official visit by a foreign leader since the start of the pandemic.
travel bubble conditionsresponding to a question following the prime ministers' statements, mr morrison said singapore is the first country outside of new zealand that australia wishes to engage in a travel bubble with.
adding that australia's system for digital vaccination certificates had just gone live, he said: "and we get it right in singapore, which we know we can do, because of the very sophisticated systems that singapore has.
""and with some encouragement from prime minister lee, we really do want to focus on those students coming .
.
.
as part of the exercise piloting how these systems can work most effectively when we get to the next phase .
.
.
but the timing of that is still somewhere away.
""quite a number" of students from singapore study in australia and some students came home due to the covid-19 pandemic, said mr lee.
these students in singapore are unable to go back to australia to resume their studies, and "there's urgency for them", he added.
"especially for those of them who have got clinical attachments or postings, and to be unable to take them up, it's very, very disruptive to their studies.
"mr lee said he also suggested to mr morrison that these students could be one way to test the safe travel systems and "get a pilot going so that we can widen the project", and later on implement a full travel bubble between singapore and australia.
"there's no timetable, but we hope it can be done as soon as possible.
"vaccination rates and covid-19 transmission rates will be considered when setting up the travel bubble, said mr lee during the press conference.
"i would say that in singapore, we are making good progress with our vaccination program.
in australia, they're also steadily vaccinating the population.
and i think once the majority of the population is vaccinated, it becomes much easier for us to contemplate these openings," he added.
the prevailing transmission rates will "certainly be a factor", said mr lee.
"what we want to do is to get the preconditions infrastructure ready, the vaccine recognition, what are the standards, what are the conditions.
then the actual decision to do it, that is a political decision.
but let's get everything teed up, so that we are in the position to make the political decision when we want to do so," he added.
neither singapore nor australia has identified a benchmark vaccination rate that would influence the decision on an air travel bubble, said mr morrison, adding that this would be dependent on the advice of the medical community.
defence and fintech partnershipsaddressing other areas of partnership between singapore and australia, mr lee noted that the two countries' treaty on military training and training area development came into force in december 2020.
"this was a milestone in our longstanding defence partnership," he added.
"singapore greatly appreciates australia's generous and sustained support for saf's training.
over many years, in many air bases and camps all over australia.
"the bilateral digital economy agreement between the two countries also came into force in 2020, said mr lee.
"this was the fruit of our forward looking, open and progressive attitudes towards trade and the future economy," he added.
building on the agreement, the two leaders will commence discussions to develop a fintech bridge between the two countries, said mr lee in his opening remarks.
singapore and australia are also exploring collaborations on low-emissions solutions to support climate change efforts, said mr lee.
"this is another key domestic priority for both of us, and it includes a public-private partnership on low emissions fuels and technologies for shipping and port operations, based at nanyang technological university's eco labs.
"we are also exploring a broader partnership on a green economy agreement.
this will facilitate trade and investment in environmentally sustainable goods and services, and strengthen environmental governance and our capacity to address climate change.

the call came as the leaders of the g7 group met friday in cornwall, england.
(file)a top chinese diplomat on friday condemned washington's "small circle" diplomacy, state media reported, in a phone call with us secretary of state antony blinken as g7 leaders met for their first in-person summit in nearly two years.
yang jiechi, the chinese communist party's chief diplomat, told blinken that "genuine multilateralism is not pseudo-multilateralism based on the interests of small circles".
"the only genuine multilateralism is that founded on the principles of the charter of the united nations and international law," yang told blinken, in their first one-on-one talks since acrimonious china-us discussions in anchorage in march.
the call came as the leaders of the g7 group -- the united states, the united kingdom, france, canada, germany, italy, and japan -- met friday in cornwall, england, with the challenge posed by china top of the agenda.
the us administration of joe biden has maintained a firm line against china, and hopes to rally allies to counter beijing on trade, technology and human rights -- particularly in the restive region of xinjiang, where washington has accused china of genocide.
yang on friday hit back against those claims, urging the united states to "resolve its own grave human rights violations and not use so-called human rights issues as a pretext to arbitrarily interfere in the internal affairs of other countries".

new york (afp) it sounds like a real-life take on "pinocchio" a us lobster fisherman says he was scooped into the mouth of a humpback whale friday (june 11) and yet lived to tell the story.
"i was in his closed mouth for about 30 to 40 seconds before he rose to the surface and spit me out," michael packard wrote on facebook hours after his brush with the depths.
"a humpback whale tried to eat me," he added.
"i am very bruised up but have no broken bones. "
packard's beyond-belief big fish yarn began, he told local paper cape cod times, when he was diving for lobster off the coast of the northeastern state of massachusetts.
"all of a sudden, i felt this huge shove and the next thing i knew it was completely black," he said after being released from the hospital.
he was about 35 feet down (10m) and his first thought was that he had been attacked by a shark, but the lack of teeth and obvious wounds made him reconsider.
packard said he began to struggle but unlike in the classic children's tale "pinocchio" there was no need to build a fire to secure his escape.
"i saw light, and he started throwing his head side-to-side and the next thing i knew i was outside (in the water)," packard told the paper.
the story says packard's fishing mate josiah mayo "saw the explosion of water as the whale surfaced and packard was ejected," but doesn't include any quotes attributed to him.
jooke robbins, director of humpback whale studies at the center for coastal studies in provincetown, massachusetts, said she had no reason to doubt the account.
"i didn't think it was a hoax because i knew the people involved.
.
.
so i have every reason to believe that what they say is true," she told afp.
robbins said she had never heard of an "accident" of this type, but "it may be that he (packard) was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. "
"when they (whales) fish.
.
.
they rush forward, open their mouth and engulf the fish and the water very quickly," she said, adding they have large mouths, but throats so narrow they wouldn't be able to swallow a human.
the whale, which according to mayo's description was on the young side, "may not be able to detect quickly enough that something is in the way. "
even if all the details weren't yet known, one thing was clear for robbins: "it is important for people to be quite aware.
.
.
and when they see a whale, keep a good distance.
it's really important to give whales their space.

singapore — a review of the proposed singapore-hong kong air travel bubble (atb) is set for early july, said the ministry of transport (mot) on thursday (10 june), after its launch was previously deferred several times.
the launch was deferred from a target date of 26 may following a mutual agreement between minister for transport s iswaran and hong kong secretary for commerce and economic development edward yau, due to the worsening covid-19 situation in singapore.
mot noted that the situation in singapore has since improved, with the number of community cases and local unlinked coronavirus cases showing a downward trend.
meanwhile, the situation in hong kong continues to remain stable, with very few community cases over the past few weeks.
"both singapore and hong kong remain strongly committed to launching the atb safely.
we will continue to monitor the public health situation in both places closely," said mot.
the travel bubble was initially announced on 11 november 2020 to much fanfare, touted as the first of its kind in the region, or even the world.
however, just 10 days later, the original 22 november launch was suspended for two weeks due to a surge in covid-19 cases in hong kong.
it was later delayed indefinitely on 1 december "in view of the severity of the epidemic situation in hong kong with the number of local cases of unknown sources increasing rapidly," said the hong kong government.
separately, health minister ong ye kung, who co-chairs a multi-ministry taskforce on covid-19, told reporters at a virtual press conference that there are no "firm plans" for a travel bubble with south korea.
"i think it's actually good to continue discussions with different partners, regions and countries on what are the possibilities going ahead, but as of now i don't think there are any firm plans.
"ong was responding to a question about reports that south korea aims to expedite travel bubble talks with singapore to allow quarantine-free travel for fully vaccinated people from as early as july.
ong, who was previously transport minister, noted that the term "travel bubble" has often been loosely used.
in the case of singapore and hong kong, they are two "very safe regions" that want to form a free travel area, which involves pre-departure testing and on-arrival testing, without any quarantine when passengers arrive, ong said.
"in the case of south korea, i believe the concept has been a vaccinated travel bubble, which means if both regions have managed their infections up to a very low level.
.
.
and they are confident that if travellers are vaccinated, it's safe enough to travel with some precautions.
"he added, "i think these are concepts that we need to think about, for the medium term, and definitely not in this period, when we are just recovering from this wave of transmission and opening up in stages, but i think it's always good that we cast our minds several months down the road, because we do need to live our lives normally and resume normalcy.

[update: june 12]article updated with zoe tay's response.
gift shopping for friends is usually a tricky business.
you want it to be personal, but also thoughtful and practical.
well, local actress zoe tay has probably given one of the best gifts of all — bras.
no joke, the mediacorp ah jie sent a care package to two of her celebrity friends, sharon au and local songbird stefanie sun.
the care package came with some bras, along with six bottles of fabric perfumes.
the contents were shared on instagram stories by both celebrities and stefanie had a rather cheeky response.
the 42-year-old wrote: "a sudden sweet surprise arrived.
ah jie, you really think too highly of (my size) hor.
"as for sharon, who is back in singapore till august and is currently serving out her quarantine at an orchard road hotel, she recalled her rookie days in showbiz and how zoe looked out for her.
she shared: "when i was a rookie in the industry and had to interview zoe, she knew i was nervous and made extra effort to be affable and reassuring.
now i'm all grown up and she continues to care and encourage.
"this is why she is our ah jie forever.
thank you for the surprise zoe.
"sharon, 45, also previously shared that zoe's presence at the hotel when she came to deliver the gift and some food caused quite the commotion.
based on the instagram tags from the celebrities, it seems that the lingerie might have come from amanda fashion gallery while the perfumes are from f'diary.
we reached out to zoe's manager for clarification, and zoe said she is not the brands' ambassador and is only supporting a friend's business.

singapore and australia will work towards an air travel bubble, and both nations will lay the groundwork for resuming two-way travel in a safe and calibrated manner, said the prime ministers of both countries yesterday.
they also hoped that students from singapore could be the first to travel under a pilot arrangement so that they can continue their studies, which have been disrupted by covid-19 travel restrictions, before a full travel bubble is in place.
the leaders were speaking to reporters after prime minister lee hsien loong met his australian counterpart scott morrison at the istana for the sixth australia-singapore annual leaders' meeting.
this is the first official visit by a foreign leader to singapore since the start of the covid-19 pandemic, and mr morrison's second stop after new zealand last month.
at a joint press conference after their meeting, pm lee said they discussed the fight against covid-19 and resuming travel between the two countries.
"we discussed how two-way travel between singapore and australia can eventually resume, in a safe and calibrated manner, when both sides are ready," he said.
pm lee added that there is a need to prepare the infrastructure and processes for such travel.
he said: "it starts with mutual recognition of health and vaccination certificates, possibly in a digital form.
when all the preparations are ready, then we can start small with an air travel bubble to build confidence on both sides.
"echoing pm lee, mr morrison said that while there is some time before singapore and australia can open up the air travel bubble, the two countries are working on putting systems in place to do so.
the leaders also acknowledged the importance of open borders to post-pandemic recovery.
on students getting the first opportunity to travel, they said such a move could be a good opportunity to test the systems, before widening travel.
mr morrison said: "we really do want to focus on those students coming, as a first wave, a first tranche as part of the exercise of piloting how these systems can work most effectively when we get to the next phase.
"pm lee said he raised this matter with mr morrison specifically because "quite a number" of singaporeans study in australia and there is urgency for them to go back to school, especially for those who have secured clinical attachments or postings.
mr morrison said singapore is the first country outside of new zealand that australia would wish to engage in a travel bubble with.
"and we want to get it right in singapore, which we know we can do because of the very sophisticated systems that singapore has," he added.
pm lee noted that australia and singapore have similar approaches to keeping the virus out of their populations and keeping their people safe.
both countries also strongly supported each other during the early stages of the pandemic.

the covid-19 vaccine task force of the u. s.  centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) stated that it has observed increased cases of heart inflammation in adolescents and younger adults, especially aged 12 to 24, following inoculation with authorized mrna-based covid-19 vaccines from moderna mrna, and pfizer pfe/biontech bntx.
several hundreds of cases of myocarditis and pericarditis, both conditions of heart inflammation, were reported to the u. s.  government's vaers (vaccine adverse event reporting system) following dose 1 of any mrna-based vaccine in the last two months.
please note that vaers is a national early warning system to detect possible safety problems in u. s.  licensed vaccines.
the number of cases increased further after the second dose of these vaccines.
moreover, the cases occurred in higher number of younger patients following dose 2 compared to dose 1.  the cdc stated that similar inflammation cases were not reported following vaccination with j&j's jnj adenovirus-based covid-19 vaccine.
per a reuters report, the israel's health ministry raised the alarm when it reported a likely link of heart inflammation in young men vaccinated with pfizer's bnt162b earlier this month.
following this report, the cdc and health regulators in other countries started investigating such cases.
although the number of reported cases is small compared to total inoculations with mrna vaccines, they were higher than expected in the younger age groups.
we note that the cdc is yet to link these adverse events to mrna vaccines and has scheduled a meeting of the advisory committee on immunization practices (acip) on jun 18 to discuss and assess the heart inflammation reports.
moreover, the government authority has recommended continuation of vaccination for everyone of age 12 or older given the risk of covid-19 illness and related complications.
however, we note that the cdc report also stated that more than 50% of heart inflammation cases were reported in the age group of 12-24 that has received only 8.
8% of vaccine doses.
this suggests that any adverse outcome from the acip meeting scheduled next week can hamper vaccination with mrna vaccines in the adolescent patient group, and hurt prospects of these vaccine developers.
however, the percentage of inflammation cases suggests that the risk from these vaccines is significantly lower than their benefits.
a cdc study claims that these vaccines are 91% effective.
moreover, most patients facing inflammation issues quickly felt better following medication and rest.
we remind investors that pfizer/biontech's covid-19 vaccine received authorization for emergency use in adolescents last month from the fda.
moderna filed for a similar authorization in the united states, europe and canada earlier this month.
meanwhile, pfizer and biontech have pledged two billion doses of their covid-19 vaccines to ensure equitable access to their vaccines globally.
as part of the pledge, the company plans to supply 200 million doses in 2021 and 300 million doses in the first half of 2022 to the u. s.  government at not-for-profit price.
the government will donate these doses to low- and lower middle-income countries and organizations that support them.

the cape cod fisherman estimates he was in the beast's mouth for 30 seconds; experts say the encounter was a flukelast modified on fri 11 jun 2021 23.
32 bsta commercial lobster diver who got caught in the mouth of a humpback whale off the coast of cape cod on friday morning said he thought he was going to die.
michael packard, 56, of wellfleet, told wbz-tv after he was released from cape cod hospital that he was about 45ft (14 meters) deep in the waters off provincetown when "all of a sudden i felt this huge bump, and everything went dark".
he thought he had been attacked by a shark, common in area waters, but then realized he could not feel any teeth and he wasn't in any pain.
"then i realized, oh my god, i'm in a whale's mouth .
.
.
and he's trying to swallow me," he said.
"and i thought to myself ok, this is it – i'm finally – i'm gonna die. "
his thoughts went to his wife and children.
he estimates he was in the whale's mouth for about 30 seconds, but continued to breathe because he still had his breathing apparatus in.
then the whale surfaced, shook its head, and spat him out.
he was rescued by his crewmate in the surface boat.
his sister, cynthia packard, originally told the cape cod times that her brother broke a leg, but he said later that his legs are just bruised.
charles "stormy" mayo, a senior scientist and whale expert at the center for coastal studies in provincetown, told the newspaper that such human-whale encounters are rare.
humpbacks are not aggressive and mayo thinks it was an accidental encounter while the whale was feeding on fish, likely sand lance.
singapore — dining in at food and beverage establishments can resume from 21 june, provided the covid-19 situation remains under control in the coming weeks, the multi-ministry taskforce (mtf) on the pandemic said on thursday (10 june).
the measure was unveiled by the mtf at a virtual media conference as it announced that singapore will gradually move back to phase 3 (heightened alert) in two steps, with one set of measures taking effect from 14 june and another from 21 june.
f&b establishments are reminded to strictly observe at least one metre safe distancing between groups of diners of no more than five persons per group so as to mitigate the risk of transmission between unmasked persons, the ministry of health said separately in a statement.
"we will be significantly stepping up enforcement and will take firmer enforcement action for any breaches.
patrons are reminded to keep their masks on at all times, except when eating or drinking," moh said.
mtf co-chair lawrence wong, who is also finance minister, acknowledged that f&b operators would be disappointed by the prospect of having to wait one more week before they can re-open.
"i would ask all of them to make use of the one week to really go through their processes, their protocols, make sure that their restaurant layouts comply fully with the rules.
.
.
because we know that these are high risk settings.
"singapore is currently in phase 2 (heightened alert) reopening, which started on 16 may and will end on 13 june.
the mtf also announced the following measures taking effect from 21 june, on condition of the pandemic situation remaining under control:wedding receptions will be allowed to resume with up to 100 attendees including the wedding couple but excluding vendors, with pre-event testing (pet) required for all attendees.
for wedding receptions up to 50 attendees, pet is required only for all members of the wedding party of up to 20 attendees including the wedding couple.
the unmasking and singing/playing of wind instruments for live performances will be allowed, subject to relevant safe management measures, which will be released by the national arts council (nac).
singing and playing of wind instruments may also resume for live performances at congregational and worship services.
gyms and fitness studios may resume indoor mask-off sports activities, with safe distancing of at least two metres between persons and at least three metres between groups of up to five persons.
sports classes – both indoors and outdoors – will be capped at 30 persons, including the instructor, with groups of no more than five persons each.
class participants may unmask if they are engaging in strenuous activities, although they are strongly encouraged to remain masked where possible to reduce the risk of transmission.
sportsg will announce more details later.
in-person tuition and enrichment classes for those aged 18 and below will be allowed to resume with enhanced safe management measures.
the ministry of education will announce more details later.
higher-risk arts and culture classes such as singing, and wind instruments will also be allowed to resume.
the nac will announce more details later.
wong told reporters that, going forward, the government would take more "aggressive localised actions", such as snap lockdowns, in order to avoid having to impose general nationwide restrictions like another circuit breaker.
"we think that's the way to live with the virus, while enabling most activities to resume. "

kuala lumpur the president of umno the biggest party in malaysia's ruling perikatan nasional (pn) government has proposed the ongoing state of emergency come to an end in august and for parliament to reconvene, in his audience with the king on friday (june 11).
"this is to ensure the country's democratic system is defended," datuk seri ahmad zahid hamidi told reporters following an hour-long meeting with sultan abdullah ahmad shah.
"it's obvious that the government in the past could deal with covid-19 issues without declaring an emergency," mr ahmad zahid said.
the king has been meeting political party leaders at the national palace since wednesday to discuss the pandemic and the government's handling of it.
mr zahid's stance came a day after former prime minister mahathir mohamad, during his own meeting with the king, proposed the setting up of a national operations council (noc) under the state of emergency.
he offered to lead the council.
dr mahathir said the noc, which governed the nation for two years after the may 13, 1969 race riots, allowed malaysia's second prime minister, tun abdul razak hussein, to "solve political problems at the time" by bringing in opposition parties to form a wider barisan nasional ruling coalition that had a stronger majority.
the king is meeting all political party leaders to hear their views about the covid-19 crisis in the country and the state of emergency that was imposed in january, with his consent, to allow the government to curb the spread of the pandemic.
it is due to end in august.
the crisis has worsened during the emergency period, with the country imposing its third lockdown which was due to end on june 14.  the government on friday announced that this would be extended by another two weeks to june 28 .
the king is also meeting the leaders of the malaysian indian congress, which is also part of the pn government, and parti bersatu sabah.
besides tun mahathir, he has met prime minister muhyiddin yassin, opposition leader anwar ibrahim, who is also head of parti keadilan rakyat, as well as other opposition leaders such as the democratic action party's mr lim guan eng and amanah's mr mohamad sabu.
friday is the final day for the face-to-face audience granted to political leaders, and an online meeting has been scheduled with sarawak's ruling party gabungan parti sarawak on monday.
the king will be meeting the country's eight other rulers in a special conference on june 16 to discuss the emergency and covid-19 crisis.

canberra: australia will refurbish its ageing collins-class submarine fleet, the australian newspaper reported on friday (jun 11), as doubts over canberra's a$50 billion (us$38.
8 billion) deal for 12 new submarines built by french shipbuilder naval group grow.
australia in 2016 selected naval group to build a new submarine fleet to replace its more than two-decades-old collins submarines and significantly expand its military to protect strategic and trade interests in the asia pacific.
the deal, one of the world's most lucrative defence deals, has been beset by issues and delays due to canberra's requirement that the majority of the manufacturing and components be sourced locally.
as a result, australian defence officials to last month said they were undertaking "contingency planning".
casting further doubt over the deal with naval group, the australian reported the minister for defence peter dutton will order a refit of existing collins-class submarines.
"clearly there have been problems with the arrangements with naval group," dutton told the australian.
"there has been concern on both sides in relation to the programme and i need to make sure that we have the best capacity available to us.
"australian first discussed replacing its trouble-plagued collins class submarines nearly a decade ago.
the collins submarines were due to be retired in the next few years.
the first of australia's six collins-class submarines reaches the end of its lifespan in 2026.  this is several years before the first of the new fleet, a diesel-electric version of naval group's 5,000-tonne barracuda nuclear-powered submarine, is scheduled to be delivered.
the final new submarine will be operational during the 2050s.
australia's prime minister scott morrison will meet with french president emmanuel macron next week and the two are expected to discuss the submarine deal.

singapore – indoor fitness activities will be allowed to resume from 21 june if the covid-19 situation in singapore remains under control in the next few weeks, the multi-ministry taskforce shared in a press conference on thursday (10 june).
gyms and fitness studios may resume indoor mask-off sports activities, with safe distancing of at least two metres between persons and at least three metres between groups of up to five persons.
sports classes (both indoors and outdoors) will be capped at 30 persons (including the instructor), comprised of groups of no more than five persons.
class participants may unmask if they are engaging in strenuous activities, although they are strongly encouraged to remain masked where possible to reduce the risk of transmission.
ken mok, the ceo of true group, shared with yahoo lifestyle sea that he was happy to hear the news: "we are happy and grateful that we can soon welcome our members back to our clubs with appropriate safe distancing measures in place.
while we have been conducting online and outdoor classes that have been very well received, our members have been raring to return to their regular fitness sessions.
"mok added that in line with safe management measures, their clubs are cleaned and sanitised every two hours: "we are committed to doing our part in keeping singapore safe, and we are waiting to hear from the authorities on the required testing regime.
prior to the recent closures, we clean and sanitise our clubs every two hours, which is above and beyond requirements.
we will continue to do so, and take other active steps to ensure the safety of our team and members.
"as for sarah stuart, owner of the f45 training jurong cbd studio, she remains hopeful about the news.
"we welcome the government's decision to allow indoor activities to resume and are prepared to comply with safe-distancing guidelines to ensure our wider community, including staff and members, remain safe.
as we await further details, we will continue to ensure contactless check-in at studios via our app, and ask all members to use our disinfection station upon entering the studio.
our format also allows for members to work at their own station with all the disinfected equipment they need to avoid sharing with any others," said stuart.
brad robinson, ceo of boutique gym chain ritual gym singapore, said that his members are itching to get back to a regular fitness routine, which also means "being able to use fitness equipment and not wearing a mask during exercise. "
"we are thrilled that restrictions are starting to ease, and that the national measures put in place proved to be effective.
the national vaccination drive along with easier testing options should allow us to get back to business as usual in short to medium term, which is very exciting," robinson said upon hearing the positive news.

singapore slots at vaccination centres offering the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine are being taken up more quickly than those for moderna, after vaccination bookings were made available for those aged 12 to 39 on friday (june 11).
as people can opt for either of the two available vaccines here, some have preferred the pfizer-biontech vaccine because its side effects are said to be less severe, among other reasons.
it is also the only one here approved for those under the age of 18. at the media conference by the multi-ministry task force tackling covid-19 on thursday (june 10), health minister ong ye kung said those who choose to go to vaccination centres that offer the moderna vaccine are much likelier to get an earlier slot, since students under 18 can take only the pfizer-biontech jab.
the vaccination drive for 400,000 students aged 12 and above began on june 3. checks by the straits times on friday afternoon showed that the earliest slot available for the moderna vaccine is june 12, compared with june 21 for the pfizer-biontech vaccine.
all vaccination centres tagged "more slots available" on a covid-19 vaccination appointment booking page seen by st offer the moderna vaccine.
ms germaine koh, 22, a student at nanyang technological university, chose the pfizer jab after observing the side effects of those around her who had been vaccinated.
she said: "my parents took moderna and they had slight fevers after taking the jab, but some others who took pfizer said that they had little to no side effects.
"some, such as university student isabel dyason, 22, chose vaccination centres that offer the pfizer-biontech vaccine even though they were farther away from home.
ms dyason, who lives in tampines, booked her first jab on june 25 at bedok community centre.
the shorter waiting period between doses for the pfizer-biontech vaccine 21 days against moderna's 28 days also appeals to some, while others said they chose it because more vaccination centres are offering it.
there were also those who thought the two vaccines are equally safe and effective, and chose their vaccination centres based on convenience.
ms goy shi yi, 32, a communications manager, said: "i wanted to get it done early and as soon as possible, because the situation may worsen very quickly as we've seen from all the recent clusters.
"she booked a slot for saturday at radin mas community club, which is just a few bus stops from her home.
"i did read up on the differences between moderna and pfizer, but from what i see, they have similar efficacy levels and side effects.
side effects like fever aren't of much concern to me.
if we're talking about rashes or some blood clots, then perhaps i'd be more worried," she added.
a study, conducted by the united states centres for disease control and prevention and published in the journal of the american medical association in april, found that those who received the moderna vaccine more frequently reported side effects such as redness over the injection site, muscle aches and fevers than those who received the pfizer-biontech vaccine.
after the second dose, 74.
8 per cent of moderna recipients reported reactions such as fever, headache and fatigue, compared with 64.
2 per cent of those who received the pfizer-biontech vaccine.
associate professor hsu li yang of the national university of singapore saw swee hock school of public health said the reasons for the difference are still unknown.
however, in terms of severe or life-threatening side effects, the two vaccines are similar and the risks are very low.
"in fact, the risk of anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) to the moderna vaccine is about half or less than half of the pfizer vaccine," he added.

kuala lumpur: united malays national organisation (umno) has pleaded with the king to not extend malaysia's state of emergency beyond aug 1, its president ahmad zahid hamidi said after an audience with the ruler on friday (jun 11).
the party also wanted the parliament to reconvene again to ensure that the country's "democratic system can be defended", ahmad zahid told journalists outside the palace.
umno's stance echoed that of leader of the opposition anwar ibrahim, who called for the state of emergency to end as scheduled in his meeting with king al-sultan abdullah ri'ayatuddin al-mustafa billah shah.
al-sultan abdullah has been summoning political party leaders to the palace for meetings this week.
he first met with prime minister muhyiddin yassin for a pre-cabinet meeting, and then granted audiences to mr anwar, parti amanah negara president mohamad sabu and democratic action party secretary-general lim guan eng on wednesday.
on thursday, the king had audiences with leaders of parti islam se-malaysia, malaysian chinese associatio, parti warisan sabah, as well as former prime minister mahathir mohamad, who is heading the yet-to-be-registered parti pejuang tanah air.
those who received a friday slot included mic president s.  a.  vigneswaran and parti bersatu sabah president maximus johnity ongkili, while leaders from sarawak were scheduled to have a virtual audience with the king on monday.
al-sultan abdullah had earlier declared a nationwide state of emergency back in january to curb the spread of covid-19.
parliament, state legislative assemblies and elections are suspended, while economic activities are allowed to continue.
malaysia's covid-19 numbers have continued to rise since january, and as of friday, total caseload stood at 646,411 cases, with 79,848 active cases and 3,684 deaths.
with the parliamentary suspension, the legitimacy of mr muhyiddin's perikatan nasional government formed following a power tussle in february and march last year cannot be challenged in the august house.
mr muhyiddin had said he would advise the king to dissolve the parliament once the pandemic is under control.
speaking to journalists on friday, ahmad zahid said the damage of a prolonged state of emergency would be "too great for the country".
"and it was obvious that even without the emergency, the government could previously handle matters related to fighting the covid-19 pandemic," he said.
ahmad zahid, who is bagan datuk mp, added that parliament meetings would ensure that the government administration is held accountable through checks and balances.
"umno is of the opinion that the parliament is an important official platform to voice the people's grouses, such as moratorium, increasing price of goods, i-sinar and i-lestari 2.
0 and other assistance for everyone," he said, referring to the retirement fund withdrawal programmes.
on dr mahathir's proposal to set up a national operations council to take over the country's administration, ahmad zahid said this was not discussed in his meeting with the king.
the council, better known by its malay abbreviation mageran, was an emergency administrative body established to restore the rule of law in malaysia after the may 13 racial riots in 1969. the opposition alliance pakatan harapan has rejected the proposal on friday, and reiterated its stance that the state of emergency should end immediately and the parliament should reconvene.
meanwhile, the palace said the king is due to meet with the other malay rulers next wednesday for a special discussion on the efforts to fight covid-19 and their implementation during the state of emergency.

the hong kong government on friday enacted new guidelines that allow authorities to censor films on the basis of safeguarding national security, escalating concerns over freedoms in the former british colony.
the government said the changes that give the film censor authority to ban films perceived as promoting or glorifying acts or activities that could endanger national security take effect from friday.
the film censorship authority should stay "vigilant to the portrayal, depiction or treatment of any act or activity which may amount to an offence endangering national security", the government said in a statement.
"any content of a film which is objectively and reasonably capable of being perceived as endorsing, supporting, promoting, such act or activity" will be censored, according to the guideline.
[[nid:522086]]beijing imposed a national security law on hong kong in june that punishes what authorities broadly define as secession, sedition and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail, following a year of sometimes violent pro-democracy demonstrations.
western governments and international human rights groups have expressed concern the security law will crush freedoms in hong kong.
a filmmaker surnamed tang said the amendment would legitimise a crackdown on protest-related films and create a chilling effect on the movie industry.
"movies on social issues will be banned.
it will silence the filmmakers," tang said.
by david brunnstrom, tom daly and michael martinawashington/beijing (reuters) -u. s.  secretary of state antony blinken stressed the need for cooperation and transparency over the origins of covid-19 in a call with chinese counterpart yang jiechi on friday and raised other contentious topics, including china's treatment of uyghur muslims, hong kong and taiwan.
yang, china's top diplomat, expressed to blinken beijing's serious concern that some people in the united states were spreading the "absurd story" about the coronavirus escaping from a wuhan laboratory, chinese state media said.
yang, head of the central foreign affairs commission of china's ruling communist party, also told blinken that washington should handle taiwan-related issues "carefully and appropriately," state broadcaster cctv reported.
the call came ahead of a g7 summit in britain attended by u. s.  president joe biden that is expected to be dominated by washington-led efforts to counter china's growing influence.
the world's two largest economies are deeply at odds over issues ranging from trade and technology to human rights and the coronavirus.
washington should work with beijing to put ties "back on track," yang said.
yang, who had a fiery exchange with blinken in alaska in march during the biden administration's first high-level meeting with its chinese counterparts, said beijing firmly opposed what he called "abominable actions" over the pandemic, which he said were being used to slander china, cctv said.
the state department said the diplomats also discussed north korea policy and that blinken expressed u. s.  concerns over the deterioration of democratic norms in hong kong and what washington describes as the genocide of muslim uyghurs in china's xinjiang region.
blinken also called on china to stop its pressure campaign against taiwan and to release "wrongfully detained" u. s.  and canadian citizens, it said in a statement.
'respect facts and science'the state department said the discussion on north korea an issue on which the united states is keen for more chinese action to press its ally and neighbor to give up its nuclear weapons focused on the need for beijing and washington "to work together for the denuclearization of the korean peninsula.
"it said the two diplomats also continued discussions on shared global challenges, including iran and myanmar, and the climate crisis.
"addressing the covid-19 pandemic, the secretary stressed the importance of cooperation and transparency regarding the origin of the virus, including the need for who phase 2 expert-led studies in china," it said, referring to the world health organization.
bonnie glaser, an asia expert at the german marshall fund of the united states think tank, said that although the agenda included potential areas of cooperation, the conversation appeared dominated by contentious issues.
she said yang's call for washington to work with beijing to put ties "back on track" indicated china was still putting the onus on the united states for the problems in the relationship.
"that's a non-starter, but demonstrates that the chinese are sticking to their tried-and-true diplomatic approaches, even though they are not successful.
"a report on the origins of covid-19 by a u. s.  government national laboratory concluded the hypothesis of a viral leak from a wuhan lab was plausible and deserved further investigation, the wall street journal said on monday.
"we urge the united states to respect facts and science, refrain from politicizing the issue .
.
.
and focus on international cooperation in the fight against the pandemic," yang said.
his comments on taiwan followed a visit to the chinese-claimed island last weekend by three u. s.  senators on a u. s.  military aircraft.
they met taiwanese president tsai ing-wen and announced the donation to taiwan of 750,000 doses of covid-19 vaccine, drawing a sharp rebuke from china's defense ministry.
in addition to coinciding with biden's first overseas trip as president to attend the g7 summit, the call comes as washington has been pushing policies to address challenges from china.
in the past eight days, biden updated an executive order banning u. s.  investment in companies linked to china's military and rolled out steps aimed at china to shore up u. s.  supply chains.
his trade representative katherine tai held a call with taiwan, the pentagon wrapped up a china policy review, and the senate passed a sweeping package of china-focused legislation.
eric sayers, a visiting fellow at the conservative american enterprise institute, said all that amounted to good timing for the administration to have an exchange with beijing.
"the white house should feel more confident taking these calls and letting beijing run down their stale talking points," sayers said.
(reporting by beijing newsroom and doina chiacu, david brunnstrom and michael martina in washington; writing by tom daly; editing by alex richardson, mark heinrich, angus macswan, paul simao and daniel wallis)china's quick rollout of a law against foreign sanctions has left european and american companies shocked and facing "irreconcilable" compliance issues, two top business groups said friday, despite beijing saying the move would unlikely impact investment.

beijing has repeated an offer to vaccinate people from taiwan against covid-19, as the coronavirus continues to spread on the island.

singapore last year, several countries in south-east asia were among the poster boys for their deft handling of the covid-19 pandemic.
now, they are battling a resurgence in infections.
case numbers are still low compared with other hot spots like india and brazil but governments in the region, nonetheless, have initiated lockdowns and ramped up testing.
they have also accelerated vaccination drives by rolling out public awareness campaigns, ironing out flaws in previous policies, scaling up inoculation efforts and dangling incentives all of which are part of the effort to protect their people and open up economies battered by the pandemic.
"south-east asia has done a wonderful job during the first wave of the pandemic but people later lowered their guard and this gave the virus free rein on the ground.
the governments have tried to ramp up their vaccination campaigns but with the exception of singapore they still have a long way to go," dr abhishek rimal, kuala lumpur-based regional emergency health coordinator at the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies (ifrc), told the straits times.
singapore is the region's leader in vaccinations, with more than 30 per cent of the population fully vaccinated.
it has allowed children from the age of 12 to be vaccinated and month-long restrictions put in place to combat a spike in cases look set to be eased from monday (june 14).
but many of singapore's neighbours are hampered by slow progress in their vaccination campaigns, with most having inoculated less than 10 per cent of their population.
several countries are now working to speed up their efforts.
indonesia, which has given out more than 30 million shots mostly to the elderly, health workers and those with disabilities is allowing old folk to turn up at any designated facility for a jab without prior registration, while offering shots to the young if they help bring in those aged 60 years and above to be inoculated.
indonesia has asked china for technical assistance to help it become a regional production hub for the covid-19 vaccine.

malaysia, which is in the throes of another lockdown after registering record-high cases and deaths in recent weeks, has opened up mega vaccination centres to inoculate up to 8,000 people a day.
vaccine trucks have been deployed to areas where people might find it difficult to get to an immunisation centre.
close to four per cent of malaysia's 32 million population a total of 1.
22 million are now fully vaccinated.
the government has said that 16 million vaccine doses will arrive in the next two months.
thailand has set a target to administer 500,000 shots per day from this month, five times more than the previous daily average.
it has announced plans to open up the tourist resort of phuket next month for fully vaccinated tourists.
the thai government has also allowed private and local administrative organisations to procure covid-19 vaccines, but only through approved agencies such as the national vaccine institute and the thai red cross society.

cambodia has mobilised the army to inoculate its citizens and the one millionth and two millionth vaccinated person received 10 million riel (s$3,244) each.
laos has banned the purchase of covid-19 vaccines by private entities in order to stave off complaints about inequality in the country, while neighbouring vietnam once a model for its successful handling of the pandemic has appealed to the public to donate to a covid-19 vaccine fund as it struggles to contain a new wave of the disease.

the philippines has extended vaccinations to children aged between 12 and 15, while private firms are allowed to procure vaccines for their workers without having to donate part of their shipments to the government.
in order to help shore up confidence in the vaccine programme and tackle the issue of vaccine hesitancy, local celebrities were roped in to get their jabs publicly, while some cities and towns went a step further by offering everything from cattle to land to property in a bid to entice people to get their jabs.

despite their best efforts to bump up vaccinations, countries in the region still face various challenges, chief among them getting enough vaccines.
it is estimated that the region will need some 1.
4 billion doses to cover the entire population of more than 650 million, leading some analysts to caution that this would be a formidable challenge since the global demand for vaccines outstrips supply.
some countries are only receiving their first stocks now.
impoverished timor leste received its first batch of vaccine doses from covax, comprising 24,000 astrazeneca doses, only on april 5 this year.
it received 100,000 doses of sinovac vaccines from china on june 7. covax is the world health organisation-led initiative to secure vaccine supplies for developing countries.
"slow vaccine roll-out will have critical consequences for south-east asia," ms hanh nguyen and mr james borton wrote in the international intelligence publication, geopolitical monitor, on may 25.
"for a region that relies heavily on export and tourism, the low vaccine coverage plus closed border policy mean countries will not open their economies soon, thus missing out on economic opportunities as the west gradually reopens.
"another issue has been competition between the west and china as beijing expands its vaccine diplomacy in the region.
apart from sales, china has donated vaccines to cambodia, laos, myanmar and the philippines.
"as of right now, china stands out in its vaccine diplomacy efforts a move that the global superpower will likely use to solidify its position within the south-east asia," mr shazwan mustafa kamal, a senior associate with political risk and public consultancy vriens & partners, told st. the united states has recently announced plans to donate seven million doses to south asia and south-east asia, while the g-7 is expected to donate one billion vaccine doses to the world's poorest countries.
but mr shazwan said western powers appeared to be playing catch-up to china.
"south-east asian nations will be in an unenviable position in balancing china's overtures as well as their relationships with the us," he added.
dr kevin s. y.  tan, a visiting senior fellow at iseas-yusof ishak institute who has written about vaccination efforts in the region, said it is too early to ascertain whether china's vaccine diplomacy will lead to any significant geopolitical shifts.
"if the pandemic drags on and if other vaccine sources are somehow limited, there will naturally be a greater dependency on chinese vaccines.
such vaccine dependency, in the long run, may bolster china's standing among south-east asian nations," he told st. logistics is another major issue in a region marked by vastly different terrain, from modern cities to rural mountainous areas and far-flung islands.
this comes on top of poor infrastructure and limited resources to distribute and store vaccines, a significant roadblock for rapid deployment, especially for last-mile delivery.
experts fear that if this is not overcome, the overall recovery for any nation will be difficult and time-consuming, especially if coronavirus variants lead to new waves of infection.
as such, it is important that governments ensure the necessary infrastructure is in place, said iseas' dr tan, especially for vaccines with ultra-cold storage requirements.
"but if such infrastructure is unrealistic at the moment, then a decision to use more 'logistically friendly' vaccines may be a pragmatic and feasible approach," said dr tan, who is also an adjunct faculty member at the school of global studies in thailand's thammasat university.
another issue that could hamper the region's success in tamping down the virus is the ongoing civil unrest in myanmar.
political instability in the country has exacerbated an already overstretched healthcare system and observers fear it is in danger of turning into the next covid-19 epicentre.
locals told st the military government has set up vaccination centres but not many people are turning up for the jabs due to high distrust of the military junta's capability to administer, store and transport the vaccines.
many have also refused to get vaccinated as a mark of protest against the junta.
"i am not getting vaccinated as i do not trust the quality and efficacy of the vaccines after the coup.
my friends and family pretty much hold the same view as well," investment analyst ye salween, 31, told st. the jury is still out on whether the region can be fully vaccinated by the end of next year, a target set for the world by british prime minister boris johnson.
ifrc's dr abhishek described it as an "ambitious" target while iseas' dr tan said to do so would require a "colossal effort" which can be achieved, but only with support from foreign countries.
"this is because not a single country in the region has come up with its own home-made vaccine against covid-19 so far.
as a region, we are still dependent on supplies and support from sources beyond south-east asia and this is a glaring vulnerability that may need to be addressed," said dr tan.
professor paul tambyah, president of the asia-pacific society of clinical microbiology and infection, said locally manufactured vaccines were "the obvious answer", noting that middle-income countries such as indonesia, thailand and malaysia had well established vaccine-manufacturing capacity.
"the key has to be the trips waiver," he told st, referring to the world trade organisation's (wto) agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights that governs the transfer of property like movie rights or vaccine-manufacturing specifics.
"with the trips waiver on patents, south-east asian countries could rapidly scale up vaccine production.
"he added that, without the constraints of the patents, mass vaccination could be rolled out very quickly the way measles and polio vaccines, which were locally made, led to the virtual elimination of these diseases.
as of now though, reports say malaysia and the philippines will experience delays in the delivery of the astrazeneca vaccine manufactured in thailand.
that is going to exacerbate the situation in the philippines, in particular, because some vaccination sites in the capital, manila, have been closed due to the shortage of vaccines.
mr jose ma luis montesclaros, an associate research fellow at the s.  rajaratnam school of international studies, has suggested that asean should support the private sector to develop vaccine production capacity.
"i feel that expanding the supplies of vaccines is something that benefits not only the vaccine- producing/recipient countries, but the world over, given the interconnected nature of global trade and investments," he told st. "the sooner countries are able to solve the health problem, the sooner they can begin working on economic recovery," he added.

beijing: a new chinese law against foreign sanctions is designed to boost beijing's power against international pressure, but could spark compliance dilemmas for foreign businesses operating in the world's second-largest economy.
it comes just a week after us president joe biden expanded a blacklist of chinese companies in which americans are not allowed to invest.
here is what we know about the law so far:what is it?the anti-foreign sanctions law was rushed into force on thursday (jun 10).
it aims to protect chinese individuals or organisations in the event that a country "uses various pretexts or its laws" to take "discriminatory" action against them.
no country is specifically named.
but beijing has accused western nations of "suppressing" china's development, especially the united states.
it has lashed out at "illegal and unreasonable" sanctions over human rights and flagged an urgent need to fight back.
what could it do?countermeasures listed in the law include denying visas, deportation, or seizing assets of those who formulate or comply with sanctions against chinese businesses or officials.
it rules that authorities are not only able to target individuals and groups but can also take aim at their family members.
the law is broad and "significantly increases the punitive power of china's anti-sanctions measures", said university of hong kong associate professor angela zhang.
"the broad scope of this framework means that lots of folks, like scholars, pundits, think tanks, could be sanctioned for supporting sanctions on china," warned julian ku, an expert on international law at hofstra university.
how could it impact business?senior executives of entities on a countermeasure list could also come under pressure, with potential implications for a large number of people and businesses.
"affected businesses could lose entire access to the chinese market, and chinese citizens and institutions will need to cut ties with affected ngos and think tanks," zhang told afp.
the law could also create severe compliance issues for multinational companies.
part of the legislation prohibits those in china from going along with designated foreign sanctions.
it acts in a similar way to a european blocking statute "which nullified the effect of us iran sanctions within the eu", said ku.
this puts foreign businesses in a bind if they cannot legally comply with both us sanctions and chinese prohibitions.
why now?the law builds on earlier measures which prevent companies and individuals from complying with foreign sanctions targeting china.
in an explainer on the national people's congress website, an official said the law was passed in a short period of time because there was "an urgent need to counter the hegemonism and power politics of certain western countries".
the law will help "counteract the containment and suppression" china faces, the official added.
beijing has long complained about us sanctions and trade restrictions affecting chinese companies.
but in recent months biden has stepped up us criticism over intellectual property theft and alleged human rights abuses in hong kong and the northwestern xinjiang region.
how much of a threat is it?ku warned the law had "some reasonable parts, and some troubling parts".
the section allowing for retaliatory sanctions "is unprecedented compared to other countries' sanctions regimes", he said.
foreign companies are regularly caught in the crosshairs of tension between china and western nations, including recent nationalist attacks on fashion brand h&m for voicing concern about forced labour claims in xinjiang.
zhang said she believes chinese authorities will not immediately wield the new powers, given that anxiety among foreign businesses could lead to more decoupling.
"if, however, foreign governments continue to press on with aggressive sanctions, then i believe china will start deploying those anti-sanctions laws to demonstrate their coercive power," she said.

chinese ride-hailing company didi revealed a $1.
6 billion net loss for 2020 as it moves ahead with plans for a u. s.  initial public offering.
the company in its first public filing for the ipo listed the offering as $100 million, a placeholder that will change when the company discloses terms for the share sale.
didi filed thursday under the business name xiaoju kuaizhi inc. , with goldman sachs group inc. , morgan stanley and jpmorgan chase & co.  leading the offering.
listen: fion li, bloomberg's team leader for asia deals, discusses didi's ipo plan with juliette saly and doug krizner on bloomberg daybreak asia.
didi, one of the largest investments in softbank group corp. 's portfolio, accelerated its listing plans after its business rebounded as the coronavirus pandemic ebbed in china.
the company has been considering seeking a valuation of as much as $70 billion to $100 billion in the ipo, bloomberg news reported in april.
in recent months, didi has been trading at a valuation of about $95 billion on the secondary market, said people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the information was private.
the company last raised funding at a $62 billion value last year, according to pitchbook.
a representative for didi declined to comment on the company's valuation.
softbank's vision fund, uber technologies inc.  and tencent holdings ltd.  are currently among didi's biggest shareholders with a combined stake of about 41%, its filing shows.
didi co-founder will wei cheng holds 7% of the shares.
softbank's 21.
5% stake could be worth $15 billion or more at the targeted valuation range, although that stake could be diluted in the offering.
the japanese company invested more than $10 billion in didi, bloomberg news has reported.
while didi has expanded into 15 countries, most of its revenue still comes from its china mobility business.
didi reported revenue of $21.
6 billion in 2020.  in the first quarter of this year, as china recovered from the pandemic, revenue more than doubled from the year before to hit $6.
4 billion.
the company also turned a profit for the quarter, reporting net income of $837 million.
the murder of two passengers by didi drivers in the summer of 2018 sparked public outrage and the mass deleting of the company's app.
didi's founders cheng and jean qing liu called the deaths the company's darkest moment.
"in the summer of 2018, two tragic safety incidents occurred on our 'hitch' platform," they wrote in a letter to investors included in the filing.
"these shook us to our core.
we felt an immense sense of sadness and responsibility and began a period of deep self-reflection.
"the company cited safety concerns among the risks to its business, saying failure to ensure safety could cause it to lose customers.
the company said in its filing that, after the deaths, it suspended the hitch carpooling service for more than a year to develop procedures to protect riders and drivers.
other potential risks for didi line up with those of their ride-hailing competitors around the world.
rivals could undercut didi's customer prices or poach drivers with better earning potential, the company said in the filing, and its business model would suffer if their army of drivers were re-classified as employees.
the company also cited the possibility of antitrust fines or regulations, as well as the chance its share price could drop because of negative sentiment in the u. s.  about chinese companies.
an ipo would cap a remarkable turnaround for a company that first ran afoul of regulators and then faced the effects of the pandemic.
didi seeks to tap the same investor enthusiasm that propelled this year's tech debuts by chinese video service kuaishou technology and south korean e-commerce pioneer coupang inc. didi's ipo would also mark a monumental year for chinese tech ipos.
kuaishou raised more than $6 billion via a hong kong debut in january, while bytedance ltd.  itself is expected to put in motion a listing later this year.
didi was founded in 2012 by former alibaba group holding ltd.  staffer cheng.
it clashed with uber in china for years until the u. s.  firm retreated in 2016, selling its operation in the country to didi.
the company is looking for capital to invest in technology, grow its presence in some international markets and introduce new products, according to the filing.
it is planning to make its debut in western europe this year, bloomberg news reported in february, and it's invested heavily in so-called community buying, one of the hottest e-commerce growth areas in china.
didi, which remains the dominant player in china, is also looking to leverage that lead to expand into adjacent arenas from autonomous driving to electric vehicles.
the company said in thursday's filing that it plans to list its american depositary shares under the symbol didi, although it didn't specify on which exchange.

japan quietly shifts its stance on taiwan amid growing concerns over beijing's economic and military might.
tokyo, japan – the japanese government has injected itself into the increasingly tense confrontation in the taiwan straits.
last friday, japan sent taiwan 1.
24 million doses of astrazeneca's covid-19 jab, after taiwan's president tsai ing-wen accused china of blocking the territory's access to vaccines amid its worst coronavirus outbreak since the pandemic began.
beijing regards taiwan – a self-governing island that lies 161km (100 miles) off the chinese coast – as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve its goal.
it has taken an increasingly assertive stance since tsai was first elected in 2016, claiming that she wants independence for the island's 23.
6 million people, and tensions have risen as traditional allies, including the united states, rallied to support taiwan.
japan has for decades taken a quieter approach.
but with china's growing economic and military might and its continuing challenge to japanese sovereignty over the senkaku islands, known to the chinese as the diaoyutai islands, the government in tokyo is changing tack.
"the japanese conservatives have really seized upon the taiwan issue as a way of drawing lines with the chinese," said daniel sneider, lecturer in east asian studies at stanford university.
china's rise has worried many in japan.
in recent years, beijing has become increasingly assertive in the asia pacific region, showcasing its military might in the east china sea and the south china sea to back its maritime and territorial claims in the disputed seas.
taiwan, which also lays claim to the south china sea, has also felt the heat from beijing.
over the past year, the chinese military has sent fighter jets into the island's airspace on a near-daily basis, with 25 chinese military aircraft flying through on april 12. in a bid to counter china's growing clout, japan is forging security ties with countries like australia and india, and reinforcing its alliance with the united states, which also sees beijing as a strategic competitor.
when us president joe biden and japanese prime minister yoshihide suga met in washington, dc, in april, china was the top focus of their talks.
and for the first time in more than half a century, the leaders' joint statement included a reference to "the importance of peace and stability across the taiwan strait".
additionally, when japan's defence ministry released a draft of its annual "white paper" last month, it mentioned the taiwan issue for the first time ever.
"the stability of the situation surrounding taiwan is important for the security of japan and the stability of the international community," the draft document said.
beijing condemned the japan-us stance on taiwan as interference in its internal affairs, accusing the two countries of "ganging up to form cliques and fanning bloc confrontation".
chinese officials have also previously described concerns over its military and economic clout as part of a "cold war mentality" that seeks to contain it.
it is in this broad context that japan, which once ruled taiwan as a colony, jumped to the island's aid as it scrambled to secure supplies of the coronavirus vaccine.
as sneider put it, "it's about demonstrating that japan has an interest in the continued de facto independence and security of taiwan.
it's that simple.
"beijing has denounced japan's moves.
when the first reports of tokyo considering sending vaccines to taipei emerged in late may, chinese foreign ministry spokesperson wang wenbin responded sharply.
"we are firmly against those who exploit the pandemic to put on political shows or even meddle in china's internal affairs," he said.
"i've noticed that japan can barely ensure adequate supply of vaccines at home.
"he added, "i would like to stress that vaccine assistance should be restored to its origin purpose, which is to save lives, and should not be reduced to a tool for selfish political gains.
"wang's contention that politics are involved was not entirely misplaced.
several reports in both the japanese and taiwanese media highlighted the role that former japanese prime minister shinzo abe, a longtime "china hawk," had played in expediting the delivery of the vaccines to taiwan.
reporting on june 3, the sankei shinbun newspaper said abe, who stepped down last september, had been closely involved in the discussions and noted taiwan's generous donations to japan at the time of the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2011. in taiwan, the japanese donation was a triumph for tsai's government.
tsai, who received global praise for her handling of the pandemic early on, is facing public anger after a sudden surge in covid-19 infections that began last month.
to date, the island has recorded 11,968 infections and 333 deaths, of which the vast majority were reported in the past month.
with less than 3 percent of the taiwanese public vaccinated, anger is growing over the shortage of covid-19 jabs.
taiwan says the crisis has been compounded by china.
on may 26, tsai accused china of using its influence to block a large delivery of the pfizer-biontech vaccine.
beijing has denied the claim, however, and says taiwan had in fact refused to accept its offer of vaccines.
wang, the spokesman for the chinese foreign ministry, also accused tsai's democratic progressive party (dpp) of prioritising "political manipulation over anti-epidemic cooperation".
lev nachman, a visiting scholar at the national taiwan university, said the dpp faced a dilemma.
"the reality is that taiwan needs vaccines," he said, "and the catch-22 is that the dpp government really can't politically afford to take vaccines from the prc.
"if the independence-leaning dpp were to turn to the mainland for help, he noted, it could undermine the party's own legitimacy as a self-governing force.
but "by taking vaccines from japan, that's much less politically loaded than taking vaccines from the prc, which is, of course, a major win for taiwan," said nachman.
moreover, the process of bringing in the vaccines from japan allowed various rival dpp politicians to make a rare show of unity, signalling that they had acted responsibly for the benefit of the people – although taiwanese authorities still have quite some distance to go to secure vaccines for the island's entire population.
even the supporters of the beijing-friendly opposition party, the kuomintang, are feeling "quiet appreciation" for japan, said nachman.
many taiwanese also took to social media to show their gratitude when news of the japanese donation came.
several people posted photos of themselves travelling in japan in the pre-pandemic era as a means to demonstrate their appreciation for and closeness with their northern island neighbours, according to brian chee-shing hioe, editor of new bloom, an online magazine covering youth culture and politics in taiwan and the asia-pacific.
hioe also weighed in on the wider strategic context, noting that japan's donation was followed a couple of days later by a us pledge of a further 750,000 doses.
"the us was coordinating this behind the scenes," hioe asserted, "to cement this relation between japan and taiwan, which is useful for regional security, for american purposes.
"after months without cases, initial response was a 'disaster', island's former health minister tells al jazeera.
move comes after us secretary of state antony blinken signalled a possible resumption of economic talks with taiwan.
us donation comes after taiwan accused china of trying to block the island from accessing vaccines internationally.
researchers say china is behind much of the disinformation, which authorities worry will put lives at risk.
