Police investigating 4 people for abusing enforcement officers, flouting safe distancing measures, Courts & Crime News & Top Stories.
houston — houston police are investigating after a new rolls-royce was found shot up and left with doors wide open on the side of the east freeway sunday morning.
this strange scene unfolded at about 2:15 a. m.  on the westbound lanes of the freeway near san jacinto.
officers were the ones who found the high-end car parked along the side of the freeway, according to investigators.
when the officers approached the car, they saw it had front-end damage.
they also found multiple bullet holes along the side of it.
all of the doors of the rolls-royce were also left open, but no one was inside.
the car was towed off the freeway and that's when investigators said they found blood inside the car, and they also found shell casings, indicating that shots were fired from the vehicle and that it may have been involved in some sort of shootout.
moments later, investigators were notified that two people who may have been inside the rolls-royce showed up to the hospital with injuries from cut glass and the airbags exploding.
police said these two people are not being cooperative with the investigation so, at this time, they have no idea what actually led to this incident and if there is anyone else involved.
the houston police department is asking anyone who may have any information on this scene, to please call the major assaults division or crime stoppers at 713-222-8477.  also popular on khou.

hong kong: hong kong police arrested at least three protesters on saturday (jun 12), the anniversary of protests in 2019 that rocked the financial hub and eventually led to beijing introducing a security law that critics say has stifled dissent.
the protesters were arrested for disorderly conduct and failing to produce proof of identity, while at least 10 people were summoned for violating a ban on gatherings, police said, after protests in the kowloon district of mongkok.
some people blocked roads by placing rubbish bins and other objects on them, police said.
"the police strongly condemn .
.
.
acts endangering public health and safety," police said in a post on facebook shortly before midnight on saturday.
the three people arrested were teenagers, aged 15 to 19, police said.
small groups gathered on saturday to commemorate the first major clashes between protesters and police two years ago when tens of thousands demonstrated against a proposed law for the former british colony that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to the mainland for trial.
many hong kong residents saw the proposed law as further erosion of the city's special status that was supposed to be guaranteed under a "one country, two systems" formula agreed when britain handed it over to china in 1997. the 2019 protests snowballed over subsequent months into a mass movement for democracy that included regular clashes between protesters and police firing tear gas and rubber bullets.
police deployed 2,000 officers around the city on saturday, the south china morning post reported.
police said on the eve of the anniversary that they had arrested two people on suspicion of promoting and inciting others to join an unlawful assembly.
activist group student politicism said two of its leaders were arrested.
there was no sign of any protests on sunday.

the victim was a domestic worker, ms domielyn santos ocampo, 40, who was later found dead at the scene.
she was married and had two sons, aged eight and 19, in the philippines.
yesterday, sy was jailed for 61⁄2 years, and will be disqualified from holding all classes of driving licences for a period of 10 years upon his release from prison.

two other charges of failing to stop after the accident and removing his vehicle from the scene were taken into consideration for sentencing.
ms ocampo was on her way home from the market at about 6am on dec 7, 2019, when sy, driving a silver lexus at about 78kmh to 81kmh on the 70kmh road, veered across two lanes and crashed into the footpath.

it took five investigation officers to track him down, after they found debris from the car, including a broken number plate holder, at the scene.
when questioned, sy took the officers to the workshop.
a splatter of ms ocampo's blood and shreds of her clothing were found on the car, which was severely damaged with a cracked front windscreen and a broken bonnet, bumper and headlamp.
the court heard that sy had been drinking beer mixed with cognac for several hours before the crash.
he had also taken a female friend for a meal and driven her home at about 5.

                the man fled to malaysia through the woodlands checkpoint sometime in october 1999, with the help of a friend.
the straits times/annsingapore, june 11 (the straits times/ann): a man who was on the run from the law for 20 years was sentenced on friday to an additional six months in jail for misleading an immigration officer and for missing a court hearing in 2000. siva kumar ramachandram, 46, fled to malaysia after being convicted here of smuggling illegal immigrants out through the woodlands checkpoint, the corrupt practices investigation bureau (cpib) said on friday (june 11).
he had been sentenced to five years in jail and 12 strokes of the cane on sept 24, 1999. but siva fled the country sometime in october 1999, with the help of a friend known only as "boy".
at the woodlands checkpoint, siva, a malaysian, used an unidentified person's passport to cross into malaysia.
he was on court bail at the time, and missed his magistrate's appeal hearing on march 9, 2000, at the high court of singapore.
a warrant for his arrest was issued that day, said cpib.
he was arrested by the cpib on march 4, 2020, with the help of the malaysian anti-corruption commission.
on april 16, 2021, siva was charged with offences under the immigration act and penal code.
he will serve the six-month jail term after completing his initial five-year sentence.
siva was given the five-year sentence after he was found guilty of a conspiracy that involved bribing a cisco officer to allow buses to transport illegal immigrants from singapore into malaysia through the woodlands checkpoint.
the cisco officer was sentenced to one year in jail and fined $2, 800 in 1999. cpib said that singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach to corruption.

singapore: a 46-year-old man who had spent more than 20 years on the run for immigration offences he committed has been arrested, said the corrupt practices investigation bureau (cpib) on friday (jun 11).
siva kumar ramachandram, who is malaysian, was arrested by the cpib with the help of the malaysian anti-corruption commission (macc) on mar 4 last year.
on sep 24, 1999, siva was convicted and sentenced to five years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane for engaging in a conspiracy to smuggle illegal immigrants from singapore into malaysia through woodlands checkpoint.
the conspiracy involved bribing a cisco officer to allow buses ferrying the illegal immigrants to pass through the checkpoint without immigration clearance.
the cisco officer was convicted on oct 5, 1999 and was sentenced to 12 months' jail and fined s$2,800 for corruption.
siva later absconded from singapore sometime in 1999, while released on bail pending appeal of his conviction and sentence.
an arrest warrant for him was issued on mar 9, 2000, the date of his appeal hearing, which he failed to turn up for.
cipb investigations revealed that in october 1999, siva left singapore for malaysia in the vehicle of an unknown individual known as "boy".
"boy" had produced a passport belonging to someone else to the immigration officer at woodlands checkpoint.
this led the immigration officer into believing siva was someone else, thus allowing him to leave singapore, said the authorities.
he was arrested on mar 4, 2020 and brought back to singapore.
siva was charged on apr 16 this year with offences punishable under the immigration act and the penal code.
on friday, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six months' jail with effect from the expiry of his existing five-year sentence meted out in 1999, said the bureau.
"the invaluable assistance and strong support by the macc has resulted in siva's arrest on mar 4, 2020.
"cpib is grateful for the close collaboration with the macc on this case to ensure that the offender was brought to justice and there was no escaping the long arm of the law," it said.
the bureau said singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption and other criminal activities.
"cpib's mandate is to investigate into any act of corruption in the public and private sectors in singapore, and in the course of doing so, any other offences under any written law," it said.
anyone who is convicted of knowingly producing any false or misleading document under the immigration act can be sentenced to jail for up to two years and be fined up to s$6,000.
anyone who is convicted of failing to appear before a court of justice under the penal code can be sentenced to jail for up to six months and be fined up to s$5,000.

singapore: two men will be charged in court on friday (jun 11) for their suspected involvement in a series of china officials impersonation scams.
the men, aged 46 and 48, are accused of collecting money from victims of the scam and are believed to have received commission for their involvement, said the singapore police force (spf) on thursday.
the police said they received reports from five victims between jul 18 and 29 last year.
"phone scammers claiming to be from the 'chinese police' had accused the victims of being involved in transnational money-laundering crimes," said spf.
"the victims were believed to have been subsequently misled into handing cash totalling s$1,580,000 to various persons in singapore to prove that their money was not derived from illegal activities.
"police investigations revealed that the two men became involved in the scam after responding to a job listing on facebook which promised s$300 for courier work.
"after being added to a whatsapp chat group and following the instructions by the group's organisers, the duo allegedly began collecting money amounting to s$230,000 from three out of the five victims," spf said.
"the collections were then purportedly handed over to unknown persons.
"both men allegedly received a total of s$15,700 as commission but they have since surrendered the amount during investigations, said the police.
they will be charged for assisting another to retain benefits from criminal conduct under the corruption, drug trafficking and other serious offences (confiscation of benefits) act.
if convicted, they face up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to s$500,000, or both.
the police advised members of the public to ignore unsolicited calls asking for money to be handed over in relation to supposed criminal investigations.
they also warned against giving out personal information and bank details.
"no local government agency will demand payment through a phone call or other social messaging platforms, demand that you hand over cash to strangers or ask you for your personal banking information such as your internet banking passwords," spf said.
"for foreign residents receiving calls from persons claiming to be police officers or government officials from your home country, please call your embassy/high commission to verify the claims of the caller.
"the police also warned members of the public not to collect money from other individuals on behalf of strangers, especially if they claim to be law enforcement officers.

the victims were believed to have been subsequently misled into handing over cash totalling $1,580,000 to various people in singapore to prove that their money was not derived from illegal activities.
the men, aged 46 and 48, are alleged to have been involved in the ruse as couriers, and received a combined $15,700 as commission.
they are suspected of collecting $230,000 from three victims, which they handed over to unidentified people.
the men got involved after responding to a job listing on facebook promising $300 for courier work.
they were then added into a whatsapp chat where they received instructions to collect money from the victims.
they surrendered their commission money over to the police during investigations.
the pair were caught after the police received reports from the victims.
the duo will be charged with assisting another to retain benefits from criminal conduct, which carries a penalty of 10 years in jail and/or a fine of up to $500,000.
the police advise members of the public to take the following precautions when they receive unsolicited calls asking them to part with their money:1.  ignore the calls and the caller's instructions.
2.  understand that no local government agency will demand payment through a phone call or social messaging platforms, or demand that they hand over cash to strangers, or ask for personal banking information.
3.  if they are not singaporean, check with their embassy or high commission to verify the call.
4.  call a friend or relative before making any decisions.
"do not be pressured by the caller to act impulsively," added the police.
the police also said that the public should not collect money for strangers, especially if they are claiming to be law enforcement officers.
"such callers are likely to be scammers, and the members of the public who act on their instructions may unwittingly have committed a crime by assisting to launder money from criminal activities," they added.
if they have information related to these scams, or if they have any doubts, the public can call 1800-255-0000 or submit it online at www.

                the man fled to malaysia through the woodlands checkpoint sometime in october 1999, with the help of a friend.
the straits times/annsingapore, june 11 (the straits times/ann): a man who was on the run from the law for 20 years was sentenced on friday to an additional six months in jail for misleading an immigration officer and for missing a court hearing in 2000. siva kumar ramachandram, 46, fled to malaysia after being convicted here of smuggling illegal immigrants out through the woodlands checkpoint, the corrupt practices investigation bureau (cpib) said on friday (june 11).
he had been sentenced to five years in jail and 12 strokes of the cane on sept 24, 1999. but siva fled the country sometime in october 1999, with the help of a friend known only as "boy".
at the woodlands checkpoint, siva, a malaysian, used an unidentified person's passport to cross into malaysia.
he was on court bail at the time, and missed his magistrate's appeal hearing on march 9, 2000, at the high court of singapore.
a warrant for his arrest was issued that day, said cpib.
he was arrested by the cpib on march 4, 2020, with the help of the malaysian anti-corruption commission.
on april 16, 2021, siva was charged with offences under the immigration act and penal code.
he will serve the six-month jail term after completing his initial five-year sentence.
siva was given the five-year sentence after he was found guilty of a conspiracy that involved bribing a cisco officer to allow buses to transport illegal immigrants from singapore into malaysia through the woodlands checkpoint.
the cisco officer was sentenced to one year in jail and fined $2, 800 in 1999. cpib said that singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach to corruption.

lee joonmin was riding along woodlands road on monday evening (june 7) when he saw the flash of a blue and red light in his motorcycle's rearview mirror.
when he realised a traffic police officer was tailing him, the 23-year-old dispatch supervisor broke into a sweat.
"to my horror, i saw the [traffic police] officer was gesturing at me to pull over," lee said in a facebook post later that evening.
it soon went viral with over 1,200 shares.
he was stunned when the officer revealed why he was getting "booked".
[embed]https://www.
facebook.
com/chifferon/posts/4324023350982616[/embed]speaking with asiaone, lee said many thoughts raced through his mind as he dismounted his motorcycle, including "oh no, what did i do", "there goes my money", "did i fail to signal?
"he recounted how there was a "super awkward and longest sentence pause of [his] entire life" before the officer told him what he was actually pulled over for.
lee was given a reward for being a safety role model to other motorcyclists on the road, as he was wearing protective riding gear.
only then did lee breathe a sigh of relief and graciously accepted the reward — a bag filled with a mask, hand sanitiser, surface sanitiser, wet tissues, an ez-link card and a pouch.
"i never expected this to happen to me," he said.
"[the officer] really had me there.
"lee isn't the only person to have been pulled over by the traffic police for being a good noodle.
since the introduction of the "reward the riders" initiative in 2019, the traffic police have been recognising and rewarding numerous motorcyclists who wear protective gear and display good riding behaviour on the road.
[embed]https://twitter.
com/singaporepolice/status/1177967230400659456[/embed]despite the heat, the expensive riding gear and the social stigma that comes with wearing the full outfit, lee said he chose to wear the protective wear as he knew the pain that came with traffic accidents.
"i crashed three whole times within my first month of riding," he sheepishly admitted.
"never again after that!"rainercheung@asiaone.

singapore a cyclist who punched a lorry driver in a road rage incident was fined $5,600 on thursday (june 10).
jeffery todd martin, 57, a canadian and a singapore permanent resident, pleaded guilty to one count each of voluntarily causing hurt and riding his bicycle without due regard for the safety of others.
at about 10.
20am on feb 24, 2019, martin was cycling in jalan eunos when a lorry overtook him.
he later overtook the lorry, pointing at the driver as he did so, and stopped in the middle of the lane in front of the vehicle.
this caused the lorry to stop amid moving traffic.
martin got off his bike and hit the driver's window, hurling vulgarities at the driver as he did so.
the lorry driver, chinese national zhang ping, 33, then moved his vehicle sharply towards martin, forcing him to step away.
zhang alighted from the lorry, holding an orange flask as he approached martin.
once confronted, martin punched him in the face, causing zhang to fall.
martin later cycled away as zhang remained in a daze sitting on the road.
zhang suffered cuts on his lips as a result of the punch, and was given medical leave for two days.
he was previously dealt with, and was jailed for a week for one count of a rash act endangering others.
a 30-second video of the incident had gone viral after the incident in 2019, and zhang had been arrested within 48 hours.
the same video was played in court on thursday.
after playing the video for the court, deputy public prosecutor emily koh said the prosecution would not be pushing for a custodial sentence, as the attack was one of low harm and culpability.
district judge brenda tan noted that prior to the punch, it was zhang who had come out from the vehicle to confront martin.
she said that while the custodial threshold had not been crossed, a high fine was warranted.
for voluntarily causing hurt, martin could have been jailed for up to two years on top of the maximum $5,000 fine he received for the charge.
for not riding his bicycle in an orderly manner with due regard for the safety of others, he could have been jailed for up to three months and fined up to $1,000.

singapore a football talent scout thought another man was making a rude gesture, and attacked the latter near his daughter's school in a road rage incident.
for that, marco paulo goncalves guimaraes, 43, has been jailed for three weeks.
the portuguese man was also fined $1,000 for not wearing a mask.
he pleaded guilty to the two charges on thursday (june 10) and was ordered to compensate the victim.
guimaraes is a fifa licensed players' agent who scouted for talent here and in the region to play in european football clubs.
he came to singapore in 2004 and founded the football management international company in 2010. on july 11 last year, at about 1pm, he went to pick his seven-year-old daughter from oasis primary school in punggol.
he drove along edgefield plains, the road just outside the school, intending to wait with other cars along the road for his daughter.
but another driver honked at him along the road.
after he gave way, he thought he saw the man make a rude gesture with his finger while driving past.
guimaraes then tailed the man in his car, confronting him without a mask on, at the loading bay of a nearby housing block.
as the victim was alighting from his car, guimaraes pushed the car door, causing it to hit the victim's shin.
he also grabbed the victim's wrist and they began arguing.
when the victim got out of his car, guimaraes pushed him.
the court heard that guimaraes hurled vulgarities at the victim throughout the encounter and put on a mask only when the victim started taking a video with his phone.
guimaraes also slapped the victim at the side of his head and kicked him before the police arrived.
on thursday, the court was told that guimaraes was deeply ashamed of his conduct and was pleading for leniency.
for voluntarily causing hurt, he could have been jailed for up to two years, or fined up to $5,000, or both.
for not wearing a mask without a reasonable excuse, he could have been jailed for up to six months, or fined up to $10,000, or both.

a 39-year-old, who wanted to leave as officers were interviewing the group, allegedly became rowdy and hurled vulgarities after he was told to stay put.
he purportedly punched another man in the group when the latter tried to calm him down.
he was arrested for using abusive language against a public servant and causing annoyance while drunk.
the group will also be investigated for breaching safe distancing measures.

that same day, the victim sought medical attention for her multiple bruises, which included bruising over her head, face, neck, arms and thighs.
she also lodged a police report.
the prosecutor asked for two weeks' jail, noting that kok's wife has since forgiven him and they are going for matrimonial counselling.
kok, who did not have a lawyer, requested for a lighter sentence with no jail, saying he would lose his job if he was imprisoned.
he said he needed the job to support his family, including his daughter and grandmother.
he asked for a chance to turn over a new leaf and said his wife was in court to mitigate for him if need be.
the judge responded: "yes, but she was not willing to be intimate and you were violent towards her.
"she added that the high court has indicated that jail terms must be imposed for cases like kok's.
kok replied that he understood and promised not to reoffend in the future.
for breaching a protection order, he could have been jailed up to six months, fined up to s$2,000, or both.
