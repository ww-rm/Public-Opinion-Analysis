singapore heart conditions associated with the covid-19 mrna vaccine are extremely rare, and it remains unclear if the vaccines are responsible for them, experts told the straits times after a handful of cases raised some concerns.
six individuals here were reported to have suffered myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after getting an mrna vaccine, among whom four are young men less than 30 years old.
the other two are a man and a woman both aged above 40. the health sciences authority (hsa) said most of the cases had occurred within a few days after receiving the second dose of the vaccine, and that all have recovered or been discharged well from hospital.
the united states and israel two major users of the mrna vaccines have also reported a slightly increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis in young men after the second dose of mrna vaccination.
but there is no need to be overly concerned as these events are rare, experts said.
professor ooi eng eong, an expert on emerging infectious diseases at duke-nus medical school, said it also remains unclear if it is indeed mrna vaccines causing these adverse events and how vaccination could have resulted in them.
as at june 7, more than 1,888,000 people in singapore have received both doses of mrna vaccines by either pfizer biontech or moderna.
an article on friday (june 11) by the american academy of paediatrics cited a rate of 16 cases of myocarditis/pericarditis per million second doses in people aged 16 to 39 years old.
such inflammation of the heart was also reported in some covid-19 patients last year, most likely the result of an overactive immune system giving rise to the inflammation.
vaccine maker moderna issued a statement on friday stating that it is aware of reports of such cases after people took its vaccine, but added that it has not established a causal association with its vaccine after carefully reviewing the available safety data to date.
as mrna vaccines lead to a similar, but milder, immune response, they could also give rise to inflammation, said prof ooi.
"but these cases, if indeed caused by the vaccine, will be much fewer compared with covid-19-induced heart inflammation ones.
"it is also important to note that the occurrence of some rare events is natural for any vaccine, especially when large numbers have been vaccinated, he stressed.
"no other vaccine has come under the scrutiny as covid-19 vaccines.
in about six months, over 1.
5 billion people have been vaccinated under close observation," he added.
he said it is unclear why young men may be more susceptible, and that it is difficult to conduct the necessary studies to determine a correlation.
"nonetheless, we can expect more detailed description of what happens to these cases in the coming months, from those that have been treated in the us and israel.
the picture may become clearer then.
"some 1.
5 million cases of myocarditis are reported worldwide a year, with population prevalence varying widely, said cardiologist chuang hsuan-hung, who practises at the asian heart & vascular centre.
myocarditis is triggered by various factors and is not a distinct cardiovascular disease.
its exact prevalence in singapore is not known.
the hsa said that in general, five to seven individuals per 100,000 people a year are hospitalised for myocarditis or pericarditis.
worldwide, viral infections are the most frequent cause of myocarditis.
other causes include drugs, autoimmune diseases and other kinds of infections, including by bacteria and parasites.
although inflammation of the heart can affect all age groups, myocarditis and pericarditis do occur more often in young adults, and pericarditis more commonly affects middle-aged adults, dr chuang added.
dr chuang said that enforced rest was crucial when one is recovering.
dr mak koon-hou, a cardiologist at gleneagles medical centre, said young adults are more prone to these conditions as they are more likely to mount a greater inflammatory response.
exercising increases the risk of myocarditis.
when a person exercises, the demand on the heart increases.
if the heart muscle is already inflamed, strenuous physical activity may worsen the amount of damage to the heart muscle, adversely affecting its function, dr mak said.
"it may result in abnormal heart rhythm and become potentially lethal.
"in general, activities such as jogging, skipping, aerobic dancing, hiking especially with a load and cycling at least 16kmh are considered strenuous activities.
it is important to note how one feels and check with the doctor regarding the most suitable type and intensity of exercise, dr mak said.
"if a person feels tired, breathless, discomfort in the chest, palpitations and giddiness, it is best to stop or reduce the intensity.
heart rates are easily measured nowadays with phones and oximeters.

singapore, june 13 — the expert committee for covid-19 vaccination has advised "adolescents and younger men" to avoid strenuous physical activity for a week after their second dose as a precaution against a "small risk" of heart inflammation.
they should also seek medical attention promptly if they develop chest pain, shortness of breath or abnormal heartbeats.
despite this, the benefits of getting vaccinated still outweigh the risk, the committee under the ministry of health (moh) stressed in a news release late friday (june 11) night.
in singapore, as of june 7, the health sciences authority (hsa) has reported four men aged 18 to 30 having myocarditis or pericarditis after they received their second jab of the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines.
another two cases involved one man and one woman who are both above 40 years old, hsa added in a separate news release late friday night.
these are inflammatory conditions affecting the heart muscles (myocarditis) and the outer lining of the heart (pericarditis).
"most of the cases were reported to have occurred within a few days after receiving the second dose of the vaccine," hsa said, adding that all the people affected have recovered or have been discharged well from hospital.
more studies and investigations are ongoing on such cases, the expert committee said.
its recommendation was made after an assessment of international reports showing that a higher-than-expected number of young men have experienced heart inflammation after their second dose of the vaccines that use messenger ribonucleic acid (mrna) technology.
this has been observed overseas in israel and the united states in adolescents and young men under 25, the committee noted.
"the risk of this has been estimated to be 1.
6 cases per 100,000 doses for mrna vaccines in the us, which is comparable to the risk of anaphylaxis (severe allergic reactions) observed in singapore," it said.
hsa said that the two cases in singapore of those above 40 years of age "is within the baseline incidence rate", while the four involving the men aged 18 to 30 "is at the upper end of the expected range for this age group, based on background incidence rates".
both the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines approved for the national vaccination programme use mrna technology.
there is no observed incremental risk of the conditions after the first dose of the vaccines, the committee said.
it also said that most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis are mild.
patients recover without the need for significant intervention and do not suffer any long-term effects, it added, "although very rarely, severe cases may result in damage to the heart muscles".
these occur more often in men compared to women and are separate and distinct conditions from heart attacks, which are caused when blood flow to the heart is blocked.
hsa said that globally, regulatory authorities, including those in israel and the us, continue to recommend vaccination for those aged 16 to 30 years to protect them from covid-19.
the 14-member expert committee on covid-19 vaccines is chaired by associate professor benjamin ong, who is the senior adviser to the director of medical services at moh and the senior vice-president of health education and resources at the national university of singapore.
the committee includes other experts in infectious diseases, immunology and other relevant fields.

europe's drug regulator on friday (june 11) identified another very rare blood condition as a potential side effect of astrazeneca's covid-19 vaccine and said it was looking into cases of heart inflammation after inoculation with all coronavirus shots.
the european medicines agency's (ema) safety committee said that capillary leak syndrome (cls) must be added as a new side effect to labelling on astrazeneca's vaccine, known as vaxzevria.
people who had previously sustained the condition, where fluids leak from the smallest blood vessels causing swelling and a drop in blood pressure, should not receive the shot, the ema added.
the regulator first began looking into these cases in april and the recommendation adds to astrazeneca's woes after its vaccine was associated with very rare and potentially lethal cases of blood clotting that come with a low platelet count.
last month, the ema had advised against giving a second astrazeneca shot to people with that clotting condition, known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (tts).
the committee reviewed six validated cases of cls in people, mostly women, who had received vaxzevria, including one death.
three had a history of the condition.
more than 78 million vaxzevria doses have been administered in the european union, liechtenstein, iceland & norway and britain.
in a statement, astrazeneca pointed to the extreme rarity of cls cases, at less than 1 in 10 million vaccinated individuals.
"we are working actively, in collaboration with regulatory authorities, on risk minimization measures.
.
.
that includes information to those being vaccinated.
.
.
information to drive early diagnosis and intervention, and appropriate treatment," the company said.
britain's regulator, the mhra said it was considering precautionary advice for people with a history of cls but does not see a causal link with the vaccine.
two of eight reports of capillary leak syndrome following astrazeneca vaccination in the uk were in people with a history of the condition, and 40 million doses of the vaccine had been given, it said.
separately, the ema said it was continuing its probe into cases of heart inflammation known as myocarditis and pericarditis, primarily following inoculation with the pfizer/biontech, and moderna mrna shots, but also after the j&j and astrazeneca vaccines.
u. s.  health officials said on thursday they had registered a higher-than-expected number of heart inflammation cases in young men who received a second dose of the mrna shots, though a causal relationship could not be established.
israel's health ministry said this month it had found a likely link to the condition in young men who received the pfizer/biontech shot.
both pfizer and moderna have acknowledged the observations but said a causal association with their vaccines has not been established.
biontech said adverse events, including myocarditis and pericarditis, are being regularly and thoroughly reviewed by the companies and regulatory authorities.
"more than 300 million doses of the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine have been administered globally and the benefit risk profile of our vaccine remains positive.
"the united states and israel have been months ahead of the eu in vaccinating men below 30, who are particularly prone to heart inflammation, giving them potentially more cases to analyse.

                    saturday, 12 jun 2021
                the pfizer-biontech and moderna covid-19 vaccines both use mrna technology.

singapore, june 12 (bernama): singapore has reported four cases of heart inflamation involving young men aged between 18 to 30 years after taking the second dose of mrna covid-19 vaccines.
the republic's expert committee on covid-19 vaccination in a statement issue late friday said most cases of "myocarditis and pericarditis" were reported to have occurred within a few days after receiving the second dose of the vaccine.
"however.
all have recovered or have been discharged well from hospital," it said.
myocarditis and pericarditis are inflammatory conditions affecting the heart muscles and the outer lining of the heart respectively.
however, the committee said that while further studies and investigations were on-going, the currently available data suggests that there might be a "very small risk" of myocarditis and pericarditis after the second dose of an mrna vaccine, particularly in young men.
"they occur more often in men compared to women.
patients with the condition show symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath or abnormal heartbeats.
"most cases are mild, recover without the need for significant intervention and do not suffer any long-term effects, although very rarely, severe cases may result in damage to the heart muscles," it explained.
as a precaution, the committee recommended that vaccinated persons, in particular adolescents and younger men, should avoid strenuous physical activity for one week after their second dose.
the committee noted that it has been closely monitoring international reports on the situation and reviewed the currently available international and local data.
"our assessment is that the benefits of receiving the mrna covid-19 vaccines, such as reduction in covid-19 infections and severe complications even if infected, continue to outweigh the risks of vaccination," it said.
it added that increased occurrences of myocarditis and pericarditis after the second dose of mrna covid-19 vaccinations have been observed overseas including in the united states (us), in adolescents and young men below the age of 25 years.
"the risk of this has been estimated to be 1.
6 cases per 100, 000 doses for mrna vaccines in the us, which is comparable to the risk of anaphylaxis observed in singapore.
"to date, there is no observed incremental risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after the first dose of vaccine," it said.

singapore four young men in singapore had heart inflammation after receiving their second dose of covid-19 vaccine.
the men aged 18 to 30 have all recovered from myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart), said the country's expert committee on the covid-19 vaccination in a statement on friday night (june 11).
most of the cases were reported to have occurred within a few days after the second jab.
this is out of a total of six such cases reported by the health sciences authority (hsa).
however, the benefits of getting a covid-19 jab outweigh the risks, said the expert committee.
as a precaution, the expert panel said vaccinated people, especially adolescents and younger men, should avoid strenuous physical activity for one week after their second dose.
during this period, they should seek medical attention if they develop chest pain, shortness of breath or abnormal heartbeats, it said.
"most cases are mild, recover without the need for significant intervention and do not suffer any long-term effects, although very rarely, severe cases may result in damage to the heart muscles," said the expert committee.
"our assessment is that the benefits of receiving the mrna covid-19 vaccines the reduction in covid-19 infections and severe complications even if infected continue to outweigh the risks of vaccination.

the expert committee added that the four cases here are at "the upper end of the expected range of this age group, based on background incidence rates".
"while further studies and investigations are ongoing, the currently available data suggests that there may be a very small risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after the second dose of an mrna vaccine, particularly in young men," it said.
the expert committee also said that heart inflammation following the second dose of the vaccine has been observed in israel and the united states in men below 25. the risk is estimated to be at 1.
6 cases per 100,000 doses in the us.
it added that there has been no increased risk associated with the first dose of the vaccine, and that the condition is generally more common in men than women.
in may, it was reported that 20 cases of anaphylaxis a severe life-threatening allergic reaction had happened in singapore in relation to the covid-19 vaccine.
in a separate update, the hsa said cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported with covid-19 vaccines both overseas and locally.
myocarditis and pericarditis have many causes and most are due to viral infections and immunological reactions, it said, and in most cases, the inflammation is mild.
the authority has received six reports of myocarditis and pericarditis, of which four were in men younger than 30 years.

six cases, four involving men aged between 18 to 30 years old, have been reported in singapore.
singapore: there may be a "very small risk" of heart inflammation after the second dose of an mrna covid-19 vaccine, said the government-appointed expert committee on covid-19 vaccination in singapore.
in a media release on friday (jun 11), the committee said it is closely monitoring international reports that the second dose of mrna covid-19 vaccines may be associated with a small risk of myocarditis and pericarditis in young men.
myocarditis and pericarditis are inflammatory conditions that affect the heart muscles and the outer lining of the heart respectively.
increased occurrences of myocarditis and pericarditis after the second dose of mrna covid-19 vaccinations have been observed in israel and the united states, and in adolescents and young men younger than 25 years.
singapore uses the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines for its national vaccination programme.
both are mrna-based vaccines.
in a separate update, the health sciences authority (hsa) said israel, which uses the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine, recently announced that there may be a probable link between the second dose and the onset of myocarditis in men aged between 16 and 30 years old in its population.
the link was found stronger among the younger age group of 16 to 19 years old.
while no other country has highlighted a similar causal link to date, the us centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) has reported that it has observed more cases of myocarditis and pericarditis in male patients aged between 16 and 24 years old.
"nonetheless, they have stressed that investigations are ongoing, and they have not made any conclusion about a causal link," said hsa.
most cases are "mild", six such reports received by hsamyocarditis and pericarditis occur more often in men compared to women.
symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath or abnormal heartbeats.
most cases are mild and patients recover without the need for significant intervention, nor do they suffer from any long-term effects.
the expert committee added that very rarely, severe cases may result in damage to the heart muscles.
the two conditions are separate and distinct from heart attacks, which are caused when the blood flow to the heart is blocked.
in singapore, hsa said it has received six such reports as of jun 7.  two of the cases involved a man and a woman older than 40 years old.
the other four cases involved men aged between 18 and 30 years old.
"(the four cases) are at the upper end of the expected range for this age group, based on background incidence rates," said hsa.
most of the cases were reported to have occurred within a few days after receiving the second dose of the vaccine.
all have recovered or have been discharged well from the hospital.
although the local numbers are small, the pattern of occurrence after the second covid-19 vaccine and in young men is consistent with what has been observed in the us and israel, which are the two major users of the mrna vaccines, said hsa.
those who developed myocarditis and pericarditis responded well to treatment and recovered, added hsa.
"overall, the benefits of the pfizer-biontech and moderna covid-19 vaccines continue to outweigh the known risks of covid-19 disease and its severe complications in a pandemic," it added.
the authority has also informed the ministry of health (moh) and the expert committee of its assessment.
"we will also continue to monitor this closely and take the relevant and necessary regulatory actions," said hsa.
the committee said it has reviewed the available international and local data.
"our assessment is that the benefits of receiving the mrna covid-19 vaccines, i. e. , reduction in covid-19 infections and severe complications even if infected, continue to outweigh the risks of vaccination.

they should also seek medical attention promptly if they develop chest pain, shortness of breath or abnormal heartbeats.
"covid-19 continues to be a health threat globally and in singapore.
"the emergence of infectious variants can lead to widespread community covid-19 transmission as well as the risk of severe covid-19 disease and complications, including long term chronic complications," said the committee.
it that the benefits of mrna covid-19 vaccination continue to outweigh the known and potential risks.
hsa and moh will also continue to monitor the safety profile of the covid-19 vaccines closely and update members of the public of any significant safety concerns detected with the vaccines.

moh noted that the incidents occurred at the upper end of the expected range for the age group.
most of the cases were reported within a few days after receiving the second dose of the vaccine.
all of the men have recovered or been discharged well from the hospital.
myocarditis and pericarditis are separate and distinct conditions from heart attacks caused when blood flow to the heart is blocked.
"we have reviewed the currently available international and local data," said moh.
"our assessment is that the benefits of receiving the mrna covid-19 vaccines, i. e. , reduction in covid-19 infections and severe complications even if infected, continue to outweigh the risks of vaccination.
"as a precaution, adolescents and younger men, in particular, should avoid strenuous physical activity for one week after their second dose.
"during this time, they should seek medical attention promptly if they develop chest pain, shortness of breath, or abnormal heartbeats," advised the expert committee.

singapore slots at vaccination centres offering the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine are being taken up more quickly than those for moderna, after vaccination bookings were made available for those aged 12 to 39 on friday (june 11).
as people can opt for either of the two available vaccines here, some have preferred the pfizer-biontech vaccine because its side effects are said to be less severe, among other reasons.
it is also the only one here approved for those under the age of 18. at the media conference by the multi-ministry task force tackling covid-19 on thursday (june 10), health minister ong ye kung said those who choose to go to vaccination centres that offer the moderna vaccine are much likelier to get an earlier slot, since students under 18 can take only the pfizer-biontech jab.
the vaccination drive for 400,000 students aged 12 and above began on june 3. checks by the straits times on friday afternoon showed that the earliest slot available for the moderna vaccine is june 12, compared with june 21 for the pfizer-biontech vaccine.
all vaccination centres tagged "more slots available" on a covid-19 vaccination appointment booking page seen by st offer the moderna vaccine.
ms germaine koh, 22, a student at nanyang technological university, chose the pfizer jab after observing the side effects of those around her who had been vaccinated.
she said: "my parents took moderna and they had slight fevers after taking the jab, but some others who took pfizer said that they had little to no side effects.
"some, such as university student isabel dyason, 22, chose vaccination centres that offer the pfizer-biontech vaccine even though they were farther away from home.
ms dyason, who lives in tampines, booked her first jab on june 25 at bedok community centre.
the shorter waiting period between doses for the pfizer-biontech vaccine 21 days against moderna's 28 days also appeals to some, while others said they chose it because more vaccination centres are offering it.
there were also those who thought the two vaccines are equally safe and effective, and chose their vaccination centres based on convenience.
ms goy shi yi, 32, a communications manager, said: "i wanted to get it done early and as soon as possible, because the situation may worsen very quickly as we've seen from all the recent clusters.
"she booked a slot for saturday at radin mas community club, which is just a few bus stops from her home.
"i did read up on the differences between moderna and pfizer, but from what i see, they have similar efficacy levels and side effects.
side effects like fever aren't of much concern to me.
if we're talking about rashes or some blood clots, then perhaps i'd be more worried," she added.
a study, conducted by the united states centres for disease control and prevention and published in the journal of the american medical association in april, found that those who received the moderna vaccine more frequently reported side effects such as redness over the injection site, muscle aches and fevers than those who received the pfizer-biontech vaccine.
after the second dose, 74.
8 per cent of moderna recipients reported reactions such as fever, headache and fatigue, compared with 64.
2 per cent of those who received the pfizer-biontech vaccine.
associate professor hsu li yang of the national university of singapore saw swee hock school of public health said the reasons for the difference are still unknown.
however, in terms of severe or life-threatening side effects, the two vaccines are similar and the risks are very low.
"in fact, the risk of anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) to the moderna vaccine is about half or less than half of the pfizer vaccine," he added.
dr ling li min, an infectious diseases expert from rophi clinic, said: "experts conclude that both vaccines are similar and equally good when it comes to efficacy, and that side effects depend more on the person than the shot itself.

six cases, four involving men aged between 18 to 30 years old, have been reported in singapore.
singapore: there may be a "very small risk" of heart inflammation after the second dose of an mrna covid-19 vaccine, said the government-appointed expert committee on covid-19 vaccination in singapore.
in a media release on friday (jun 11), the committee said it is closely monitoring international reports that the second dose of mrna covid-19 vaccines may be associated with a small risk of myocarditis and pericarditis in young men.
myocarditis and pericarditis are inflammatory conditions that affect the heart muscles and the outer lining of the heart respectively.
increased occurrences of myocarditis and pericarditis after the second dose of mrna covid-19 vaccinations have been observed in israel and the united states, and in adolescents and young men younger than 25 years.
singapore uses the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines for its national vaccination programme.
both are mrna-based vaccines.
in a separate update, the health sciences authority (hsa) said israel, which uses the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine, recently announced that there may be a probable link between the second dose and the onset of myocarditis in men aged between 16 and 30 years old in its population.
the link was found stronger among the younger age group of 16 to 19 years old.
while no other country has highlighted a similar causal link to date, the us centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) has reported that it has observed more cases of myocarditis and pericarditis in male patients aged between 16 and 24 years old.
"nonetheless, they have stressed that investigations are ongoing, and they have not made any conclusion about a causal link," said hsa.
most cases are "mild", six such reports received by hsamyocarditis and pericarditis occur more often in men compared to women.
symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath or abnormal heartbeats.
most cases are mild and patients recover without the need for significant intervention, nor do they suffer from any long-term effects.
the expert committee added that very rarely, severe cases may result in damage to the heart muscles.
the two conditions are separate and distinct from heart attacks, which are caused when the blood flow to the heart is blocked.
in singapore, hsa said it has received six such reports as of jun 7.  two of the cases involved a man and a woman older than 40 years old.
the other four cases involved men aged between 18 and 30 years old.
"(the four cases) are at the upper end of the expected range for this age group, based on background incidence rates," said hsa.
most of the cases were reported to have occurred within a few days after receiving the second dose of the vaccine.
all have recovered or have been discharged well from the hospital.
although the local numbers are small, the pattern of occurrence after the second covid-19 vaccine and in young men is consistent with what has been observed in the us and israel, which are the two major users of the mrna vaccines, said hsa.
those who developed myocarditis and pericarditis responded well to treatment and recovered, added hsa.
"overall, the benefits of the pfizer-biontech and moderna covid-19 vaccines continue to outweigh the known risks of covid-19 disease and its severe complications in a pandemic," it added.
the authority has also informed the ministry of health (moh) and the expert committee of its assessment.
"we will also continue to monitor this closely and take the relevant and necessary regulatory actions," said hsa.
the committee said it has reviewed the available international and local data.
"our assessment is that the benefits of receiving the mrna covid-19 vaccines, i. e. , reduction in covid-19 infections and severe complications even if infected, continue to outweigh the risks of vaccination.
"avoid strenuous activity one week after second dose of vaccineas further studies and investigations are ongoing, the currently available data suggests that there may be a "very small risk" of myocarditis and pericarditis after the second dose of an mrna vaccine, particularly in young men, said the expert committeeas a precaution, the committee recommended that those vaccinated, particularly adolescents and younger men, should avoid strenuous physical activity for one week after their second dose.
they should also seek medical attention promptly if they develop chest pain, shortness of breath or abnormal heartbeats.
"covid-19 continues to be a health threat globally and in singapore.
"the emergence of infectious variants can lead to widespread community covid-19 transmission as well as the risk of severe covid-19 disease and complications, including long term chronic complications," said the committee.
it that the benefits of mrna covid-19 vaccination continue to outweigh the known and potential risks.
hsa and moh will also continue to monitor the safety profile of the covid-19 vaccines closely and update members of the public of any significant safety concerns detected with the vaccines.

washington (reuters) a higher-than-expected number of young men have experienced heart inflammation after their second dose of the mrna covid-19 shots from pfizer/biontech and moderna, according to data from two vaccine safety monitoring systems, the us centres for disease control and prevention (cdc) said on thursday (june 10).
the cdc and other health regulators have been investigating heart inflammation cases after israel's health ministry reported that it had found a likely link to the condition in young men who received pfizer's covid-19 vaccine.
the agency said it is still assessing the risk from the condition and has not yet concluded that there was a causal relationship between the vaccines and cases of myocarditis or pericarditis.
while some patients required hospitalisation, most have fully recovered from their symptoms, the cdc said.
more than half of the cases reported to the us vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers) after people had received their second dose of either the pfizer/biontech or moderna vaccines were in people between the ages of 12 and 24, the cdc said.
those age groups accounted for less than 9 per cent of doses administered.
"we clearly have an imbalance there," dr tom shimabukuro, deputy director of the cdc's immunisation safety office, said in a presentation to an advisory committee to the us food and drug administration meeting on thursday.
the overwhelming majority of the cases have occurred within a week of vaccination, shimabukuro said.
there were 283 observed cases of heart inflammation after the second vaccine dose in those aged 16 to 24 in the vaers data.
that compares with expectations of 10-to-102 cases for that age range based on us population background incidence rates, the cdc said.
shimabukuro said there was a predominance of males in younger age groups among the reported heart inflammation cases.
the median age of patients who experienced the inflammation after a second vaccine dose was 24, according to the vaers data.
just under 80 per cent of the cases were in men.
shimabukuro also said the vaccine safety datalink (vsd) another safety monitoring system – showed an increased incidence of heart inflammation in 16 to 39 year olds after their second shot when compared to the rate observed after the first dose.
pfizer said it supports the cdc's assessment of the heart inflammation cases, noting that "the number of reports is small given the number of doses administered.
"about 130 million people in the united states have received both doses of one of the mrna vaccines.
"it is important to understand that a careful assessment of the reports is ongoing and it has not been concluded that the mrna covid-19 vaccines cause myocarditis or pericarditis," the company said in a statement.
moderna said it also has not established a causal association with the condition and its vaccine.
it said it is actively working with public health and regulatory authorities to further assess the issue.
the cdc said it will hold a meeting of its advisory committee on immunisation practices next week to further evaluate the evidence and assess the risk of myocarditis following mrna vaccination for covid-19.
