""most cases are mild, recover without the need for significant intervention and do not suffer any long-term effects, although very rarely, severe cases may result in damage to the heart muscles,"" said the expert committee. ""our assessment is that the benefits of receiving the mrna covid-19 vaccines the reduction in covid-19 infections and severe complications even if infected continue to outweigh the risks of vaccination. ""the four cases reported by the hsa are aged between 18 and 30, and had their symptoms a few days after receiving the second dose of an mrna-based vaccine. both covid-19 vaccines in singapore by pfizer-biontech and moderna use such technology. all four men have recovered or have been discharged from hospital. the expert committee added that the four cases here are at ""the upper end of the expected range of this age group, based on background incidence rates"". ""while further studies and investigations are ongoing, the currently available data suggests that there may be a very small risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after the second dose of an mrna vaccine, particularly in young men,"" it said. the expert committee also said that heart inflammation following the second dose of the vaccine has been observed in israel and the united states in men below 25. the risk is estimated to be at 1. 6 cases per 100,000 doses in the us. it added that there has been no increased risk associated with the first dose of the vaccine, and that the condition is generally more common in men than women. in may, it was reported that 20 cases of anaphylaxis a severe life-threatening allergic reaction had happened in singapore in relation to the covid-19 vaccine. in a separate update, the hsa said cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported with covid-19 vaccines both overseas and locally. myocarditis and pericarditis have many causes and most are due to viral infections and immunological reactions, it said, and in most cases, the inflammation is mild. the authority has received six reports of myocarditis and pericarditis, of which four were in men younger than 30 years.

        Emotional Denmark boss Hjulmand proud of response to Eriksen situation    .","date published: saturday 12th june 2021 10:14               samuel bannister denmark manager kasper hjulmand said he could not praise his players enough after they showed unity in the wake of the crisis of the christian eriksen situation in their euro 2020 opener. eriksen collapsed towards the end of the the first half of their match against finland and required cpr.  the game was suspended as the medics attended to the 29-year-old.  more than an hour later, they resumed play after their teammate awoke and was taken to hospital. what followed on the pitch was of little significance on an emotional evening.  denmark lost 1-0 as finland won their first ever major tournament match. the important thing for everyone involved though was knowing eriksen's condition, which was described as stabilising upon his admission to hospital. hjulmand was in tears at his post-match press conference as he reflected on a day that left the football world in shock. ""first of all, if it gets emotional, it's been a tough night,"" said hjulmand.  ""we are all reminded of what the most important thing in life is – to have valuable relationships, people we're close to, our family and our friends. ""we have a group of players that i cannot praise enough.  i couldn't be prouder of those people who took such good care of each other. ""he is one of my very dear friends.  the way the players talked in the dressing room to decide to not do anything before we knew christian was conscious and ok. ""give our social media channels a follow – we're on facebook, twitter and instagramthe circumstances were tough for eriksen's teammates.  but according to uefa, both teams requested to complete the game after they knew eriksen was in a stable condition. hjulmand shed light on the situation behind play resuming. ""we had two options to play the game [today] or tomorrow at 12pm and everyone agreed to play today,"" he said.  ""you can't play a game with such feelings. ""we tried to win.  it was incredible they managed to go out and try to play the second half.

2021-06-13,"A fragile Israeli coalition, with some underlying glue.","written by roger cohena new israeli government united in its determination to oust prime minister benjamin netanyahu, but in agreement on little else, is set to take office sunday under a right-wing leader whose eight-party coalition includes the left and, for the first time, an independent arab party. it looks like a recipe for chronic instability. even sunday's confidence vote in the knesset, or parliament, that would usher in the first change in israeli leadership in a dozen years is not a done deal, given the razor-thin majority of naftali bennett's coalition with its 61 seats in the 120-member chamber.  but every indication is that the votes to make bennett prime minister are locked in, absent some eleventh-hour drama. a signed coalition agreement was formally presented to the knesset secretariat friday, the last step before a vote and the swearing-in of the new government. survival will then become the issue.  israel's parliamentary democracy veered in a presidential direction under netanyahu.  in the end, his increasingly dismissive style had alienated too many people, especially among nominal allies on the right. agreement to return to democratic norms may be the underlying glue of the unlikely coalition. ""the parties are disparate, but they share a commitment to reconstitute israel as a functioning liberal democracy,"" said shlomo avineri, a prominent political scientist.  ""in recent years we saw netanyahu begin to govern in a semi-authoritarian way. ""after agreement was reached friday on the government program, bennett said: ""the government will work for all the israeli public — religious, secular, ultra-orthodox, arab — without exception, as one.  we will work together, out of partnership and national responsibility, and i believe we will succeed. ""success will require constant compromise.  ""they will not deal with the highly contentious issues between left and right,"" said tamar hermann, a professor of political science at israel's open university. in practice, that means a likely concentration on domestic rather than foreign affairs.  israel has not had a budget in more than two years of political turmoil and repetitive elections.  bennett, a self-made tech millionaire, is determined to deliver higher standards of living and prosperity to a population weary of such paralysis. the delicate questions to be deferred or finessed would include any renewed peace negotiations with the palestinians and any major settlement expansion in the west bank. although bennett was once a leader of the main settler movement in the west bank and has called for the annexation of parts of the territory israel captured in 1967, he seems certain to be constrained by centrist and left-wing members of the coalition and by the pragmatism that survival demands. establishing good relations with the biden administration, a priority, and improving relations with america's majority liberal jewish community, another significant goal, will also require centrist restraint. ""hard core people of the right, we have the evidence, become more centrist in office,"" hermann said.  ""bennett was not prime minister when he made his pro-settlement statements. ""bennett, 49, like other prominent members of the prospective cabinet, has waited a long time to emerge from netanyahu's shadow.  yair lapid, 57, the incoming foreign minister, and gideon saar, 54, who would become justice minister, are other prominent politicians of a generation weary of being sidelined by the man many israelis had come to dub the king of israel.  they will not want to return to the shadows. lapid, a leading architect of the coalition, would become prime minister in two years under the deal that made an alternative to netanyahu possible — another incentive for him to help make the government work. still, it may not.  the parties, ranging from bennett's yamina party on the right to labor and meretz on the left, disagree on everything from lgbtq rights to public transportation on shabbat. they will come under withering, constant attack from netanyahu's center-right likud party.  it is conceivable that netanyahu will be ousted from likud at some point, whereupon the right-wing members of the coalition may return to their natural alliances. ""it's not going to be easy,"" said avraham diskin, a political scientist at hebrew university in jerusalem.  ""i really doubt that lapid will become prime minister two years from now. ""among measures the prospective government has agreed on is legislation that would set a two-term limit for prime ministers.  in effect, this would preclude netanyahu redux. four ministries will be shut down, including the digital and strategic affairs ministries.  netanyahu had a cabinet so large and unwieldy he could argue that he had to make decisions himself. the prospective government will also pursue legislation designed to make it more difficult to change israel's basic laws, which serve as the constitutional foundation of the country in the absence of a constitution.  netanyahu, who had been indicted on fraud and other charges, appeared to seek a curtailing of the powers of the supreme court and immunity from prosecution as prime minister. the presence of raam, an independent arab party, in government, will impact policy to some degree. the disparities — in living standards, education and access to land — between israeli jews and the palestinian citizens of israel, who account for about 20% of the population, has become a burning issue.  violent clashes between the communities last month were the worst in two decades.  tensions remain high. the government looks set to allocate almost $10 billion to close gaps between the communities over the next several years, freeze demolitions of unlicensed homes in arab areas, recognize three bedouin villages in the negev desert, improve public transportation, and increase policing in disadvantaged arab communities suffering from drug dealing and violence. the posts promised to raam to secure its support include deputy minister in the prime minister's office and chairman of the knesset committee for arab affairs. but tensions could flare at any moment.  most immediately, a nationalist march through muslim-majority areas of jerusalem's old city has been rescheduled for tuesday.  the original jerusalem day march last month was canceled because of hamas rocket fire and clashes between the police and palestinian protesters. the issue remains highly sensitive, charged with the same emotions that led to a short war last month, despite efforts to agree on a less sensitive route for the march.  the political adroitness of bennett and lapid will be quickly tested. 📣 the indian express is now on telegram.  click here to join our channel (@indianexpress) and stay updated with the latest headlinesfor all the

quarantine, and one was detected through surveillance.  the remaining five cases are currently unlinked.  this updated number of new community cases – the ministry had said there were 12 such cases in

thursday said that singapore will gradually move to phase 3 (heightened alert) in two steps, with one set of measures taking effect from 14 june and another from 21 june. from 14 june, the size of social gatherings allowed in singapore will be increased to five people, up from the current limit of two persons.  dining in at food and beverage establishments, however, can only resume from 21 june provided that the covid-19 situation remains under control. in addition, work-from-home will remain the default work arrangement in phase 3 (heightened alert). with 39 more patients discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities on saturday, 61,838 cases – or 99. 3 per cent of the total – have fully recovered from the infection. most of the 125 hospitalised cases are stable or

2021-06-13,G7 rivals China's belt and road with grand infrastructure plan.,"carbis bay, england: the group of seven richest democracies on saturday (jun 12) sought to counter china's growing influence by offering developing nations an infrastructure plan that would rival president xi jinping's multi-trillion-dollar belt and road initiative. the g7, whose leaders are meeting in southwestern england and who discussed strategic competition with beijing, has been searching for a coherent response to the growing assertiveness of xi after china's surging economic and military rise over the past 40 years. us president joe biden and other g7 leaders hope the plan, known as the build back better world (b3w) initiative, will provide a transparent infrastructure partnership to help narrow the us$40 trillion needed by developing nations by 2035, the white house said. ""this is not just about confronting or taking on china,"" a senior official in biden's administration said.  ""but until now we haven't offered a positive alternative that reflects our values, our standards and our way of doing business. ""the g7 and its allies will use the initiative to mobilise private sector capital in areas such as climate, health and health security, digital technology, and gender equity and equality, the white house said. it was not immediately clear how the plan would exactly work or how much capital it would ultimately allocate. china's belt and road initiative (bri) is a multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure scheme that xi launched in 2013, involving development and investment initiatives that would stretch from asia to europe and beyond. more than 100 countries have signed agreements with china to cooperate in bri projects like railways, ports, highways and other infrastructure. critics say xi's plan to create a modern version of the ancient silk road trade route to link china with asia, europe and beyond is a vehicle for the expansion of communist china.  beijing says such doubts betray the ""imperial hangover"" of many western powers that humiliated china for centuries. china's risethe re-emergence of china as a leading global power is considered to be one of the most significant geopolitical events of recent times, alongside the 1991 fall of the soviet union that ended the cold war. china in 1979 had an economy that was smaller than italy's, but after opening to foreign investment and introducing market reforms, it has become the world's second-largest economy and is a global leader in a range of new technologies. leaders of the g7 the united states, canada, britain, germany, italy, france and japan want to use their gathering in the seaside resort of carbis bay to show the world that the richest democracies can offer an alternative to china's growing clout. the us official said that until now, the west had failed to offer a positive alternative to the ""lack of transparency, poor environmental and labour standards, and coercive approach"" of the chinese government that had left many countries worse off. according to a refinitiv database, as of mid-last year, more than 2,600 projects at a cost of us$3. 7 trillion were linked to the initiative, although the chinese foreign ministry said last june that about 20 per cent of projects had been seriously affected by the covid-19 pandemic. as part of the g7 plan, the united states will work with the us congress to supplement existing development financing and to ""collectively catalyse hundreds of billions of dollars of infrastructure investment,"" the white house said. forced labourthe united states is pushing the other g7 leaders for ""concrete action on forced labour"" in china, and to include criticism of beijing in their final communique from a three-day summit in southwest england, the us official said. biden planned to press the other leaders to make clear that they believe forced labour practices are an affront to human dignity and ""an egregious example of china's unfair economic competition"". ""we're pushing on being specific on areas like xinjiang where forced labour is taking place and where we have to express our values as a g7,"" the official said of the final communique to be issued at the end of the summit on sunday. china denies all accusations of abuse in the xinjiang region. the chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the g7 infrastructure proposal or the us official's remarks about forced labour. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-13,MOH: Public can purchase COVID-19 antigen rapid test kits for self-testing from pharmacists starting 16 June.,"photo credit: ong ye kung/facebookmembers of the public who wish to get their hands on the covid-19 antigen rapid test (art) kits for self-testing can do so from next wednesday (16 june) onwards as they will be ""sold by pharmacists"", said the ministry of health (moh) on thursday (10 june). it was stated that these self-testing kits, which include abbott panbio covid-19 antigen self-test, quickvue at-home otc covid-19 test, sd biosensor sars-cov-2 antigen self-test nasal and sd biosensor standard q covid-19 ag home test, have been given interim authorisation from the health sciences authority (hsa) to be sold to the general public. moh revealed that these tests will be able to generate results in less than 20 minutes. ""they are simple to use, they can be self-administered.  from next week, jun 16, these kits will be dispensed by pharmacists at selected retail pharmacies.  we will then open up for counter sales at more retail locations progressively,"" said health minister ong ye kung at a multi-ministry task force press conference. for a start, the sales will be limited to 10 art kits per person in order to make sure that there are ""adequate supplies for all"", but once more supplies are made available for retail sales, authorities will ""eventually allow test kits to be freely purchased"", said the health ministry's director of medical services kenneth mak. as singapore prepares to ease some of its covid-19 measures from 14 june, it's important that testing can be done fast, easy and accessible, said mr ong. associate professor mak went on to note that the self-test kits ""complement"" singapore's overall surveillance strategy. ""these fast and easy to use tests allow us to detect infected cases more quickly, in particular among individuals who do not have acute respiratory infection symptoms, but are concerned that they may have been exposed to covid-19,"" he said. for individuals whose test results come out positive on these self-test kits, they should ""immediate approach"" a swab and send home public health preparedness clinic (sash phpc) for a confirmatory polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test, said moh. it added that these individuals will then need to self-isolate until they receive a negative pcr test result. ""individuals who have ari symptoms should continue to visit a doctor for a full diagnosis and pcr test instead of relying on an art self-test kit,"" the ministry said. mr ong also said in a facebook post on thursday (10 june) that these kits are available for sale at watson, guardian and unity outlets. in a separate press release on thursday, the hsa also noted that the self-test kits can be purchased without a doctor's prescription. arts identify the viral proteins in the nasal swab samples of covid-19 positive people and ""usually work best in the early stages of infection"", said the authority. ""in general, arts can achieve a sensitivity of about 80 per cent for cases with higher viral loads and a specificity range of 97 to 100 per cent,"" said the hsa. the authority explained that sensitivity means the test's ability to correctly identify covid-19 in individuals without the disease, meanwhile specificity refers to the test's ability to identify individuals without covid-19. arts have lower sensitivity than pcr tests, and this means that the rapid tests have a ""higher change of false negative results"". all arts come with pamphlets with instructions on how to use, and hsa encouraged consumers to read these carefully before using the tests. ""users should collect their nasal sample using the swab provided in the kit and prepare their nasal sample using the buffer and tube provided. ""once the sample is ready, users should perform the test using the test device and read the results,"" said the authority.  © 2006 2021 the online citizen© 2006 2021 the online

2021-06-13,Soccer-Denmark's Eriksen rushed to hospital after collapsing in Euro 2020 match.,"by philip o'connor and jacob gronholt-pedersencopenhagen (reuters) -denmark midfielder christian eriksen was rushed to hospital after collapsing during his side's euro 2020 opening match with finland and being given cpr on the pitch on saturday, with soccer officials later saying the player was stable and awake. eriksen collapsed suddenly in the 42nd minute of the match while running near the left touchline after a denmark throw-in. as a hush fell over the 16,000-strong crowd, his teammates gathered around him and one appeared to stick his fingers in eriksen's mouth to clear his airway or check he hadn't swallowed his tongue. as medics arrived on the scene and pumped eriksen's chest, his teammates formed a ring around him.  danish broadcaster dr cut the live tv feed, instead showing aerial footage of the stadium. the 29-year-old was taken to the nearby rigshospitalet, where he regained conciousness. ""we have been in contact with him and the players have spoken to christian,"" said peter moller of the danish football association. applause broke out in the parken stadium among both danish and finnish fans, when it was announced that eriksen had regained conciousness. ""he is doing well and they are playing the match for christian,"" moller said. the game was initially suspended but resumed an hour and 45 minutes later, finland claiming a 1-0 victory when striker joel pohjanpalo headed in on the hour with his side's only attempt of the game. a visibly drained denmark coach kasper hjulmand said after the match that the players were given the option to finish the game on saturday evening or on sunday. ""it was more manageable to go in again and honestly just get it over with,"" hjulmand said. several players, including captain simon kjaer, were too overwhelmed by emotions to finish the game, he said. ""i completely understand that you can't play a soccer match at this level, after watching one of your best friends fight for his life,"" hjulmand said. later in the day, belgian striker romelu lukaku, a teammate of eriksen at soccer club inter milan in italy, ran to a tv camera and shouted ""chris, chris, i love you"" after scoring in his side's opening match against russian. people gathered outside bars in central copenhagen, many in tears, while eriksen's condition remained unclear. the crowd at the parken stadium in copenhagen sang the danish national anthem and chanted ""christian eriksen"" while they waited for news, until word finally came through that the player had regained consciousness.

2021-06-13,Perfect start for Mancini's Italy in Euro 2020 quest.,"rome: italy capped a perfect night in the stadio olimpico witha euro 2020 opening win over turkeybut coach roberto mancini warned that the road was long between rome and wembley. a 28-match unbeaten run has put mancini two games short of italy's two-time world cup winning coach vittorio pozzo's record of 30 unbeaten games between 1935 and 1939. ""we still have six games ahead of us.  it's a long way,"" said the 56-year-old former manchester city manager who took over in 2018 after italy failed to qualify for the world cup that year. amid the euphoria veteran defender leonardo bonucci called for ""cool heads, humility and a down to earth"" approach while maintaining ""hearts of fire"". in front of 16,000 fans, and preceded by a glittering opening ceremony, the spark was lit for a run which mancini hopes will end with a second european title after 1968 in london on jul 11. italy have the advantage of playing their group a matches at home and next meet switzerland in rome on wednesday followed by wales four days later. for lazio forward ciro immobile, the group games at home are ""pure adrenaline"" as the 31-year-old scored his first international goal in his club stadium. merih demiral's own goal got the ball rolling in the second half before immobile and lorenzo insigne completed the victory. ""we did what we had to do, it was our duty to win the first game on front of our fans,"" said immobile, who has scored four goals in the last five matches. ""spine-chilling""mancini's front-line trio of immobile, lorenzo insigne and domenico berardi proved efficient for an italy who are without a stand-out star striker. italy missed out on the 2018 world cup, and the ""azzurri"" had not hosted an international match since the 1990 world cup. tenor andrea bocelli's rousing performance to nessun dorma, popularised during that world tournament, set the tone for the night. ""there was an incredible emotion before the match, it was spine-chilling,"" said roma midfielder leonardo spinazzola, uefa's man-of-the-match after his performance in his club stadium. ""then it was a perfect match, zero goals conceded and we played great football. ""we have a strong team, an incredible mix of strength and technique. ""berardi had a role in all three goals against turkey, and has scored five goals in his last seven games for italy. ""our secret is the group,"" said napoli's insigne. ""no one's place is guaranteed, those who play know what to do and we put ourselves at the service of each other. ""veteran coach claudio ranieri praised mancini's style which has proved so successful in reviving the four-time world champions. ""what lucidity mancio has, he knows how to manage emotions,"" ranieri wrote in la gazzetta dello sport on saturday. ""the first game is always the most dangerous, there is the pressure of the debut, the desire to overdo it can sometimes lead you to make mistakes, but roberto mancini was really good. ""he managed emotions, the tactical plan, the most delicate moments of the match with clarity. ""it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

""even if there is a strong business need, such as needing to know in order to determine if the employee can travel for business or to deploy to higher-risk front-line facing roles, do explain clearly why the company needs to know the status and generally, most employees will comply,"" she said. institute for human resource professionals (ihrp) chief executive mayank parekh said that bosses should not use non-vaccination as a reason to terminate employment as there could be medical reasons for why a staff member did not get a shot. mr tan wei ming, senior associate at law firm cms holborn asia, said that if employers want to keep records on vaccinated employees that contain personal data such as names, they must do so in accordance with the personal data protection act and other applicable data protection laws. ""for these reasons, companies in singapore are unlikely to make their employees declare their vaccination status at this juncture,"" he added. wongpartnership joint head of employment practice jenny tsin said staff members should not face discrimination arising from their vaccination status, given that its voluntary. however, there could be circumstances that warrant a different approach, such as for jobs involving higher risk of exposure to covid-19, she added. in this instance, it could be more justified to limit return to the workplace to only vaccinated employees. investment bank goldman sachs recently ordered its employees in the united states to report their covid-19 vaccination status as part of their plans to return to the office, afp reported on thursday. st understands that goldman sachs is not requiring staff here to report their vaccination status, and that most are still working from home. while professional services firm ey strongly encourages its eligible staff to get vaccinated, it does not require them to declare their status given that immunisation is not mandatory, said the singapore and brunei managing partner max loh. uob human resources head dean tong said the bank has been encouraging staff in critical roles to get vaccinated since the government announced its roll-out to essential workers in the financial sector in march. st understands that uob does not track the vaccination status of employees. meanwhile, sembcorp industries has introduced an app that provides voluntary updates on a person's vaccination status. the app, which was developed in-house, is also used to obtain online approval for essential facility visits. an amazon spokesman said that the company's employees and associates are generally not required to declare their vaccination status, except for staff members who are travelling to singapore from overseas. the firm also provides a cash benefit to front-line employees and associates who are paid by the hour when they get their vaccination off-site. shri's ms low and mr parekh from ihrp said employers can encourage immunisation by communicating the benefits to their staff as well as incentivising vaccination through means such as time off after getting the jabs and giving workers a care package. mr samir bedi, asean workforce advisory leader at ey, noted that it would not be surprising to see employers including vaccination as a pre-requisite in job descriptions in future, particularly for front-line positions that require face-to-face interactions.

2021-06-13,Biden urges G7 leaders to call out and compete with China.,"carbis bay, england: leaders of the world's largest economies unveiled an infrastructure plan saturday (jun 12) for the developing world to compete with china's global initiatives, but they were searching for a consensus on how to forcefully call out beijing over human rights abuses. citing china for its forced labour practices is part of president joe biden's campaign to persuade fellow democratic leaders to present a more unified front to compete economically with beijing.  but while they agreed to work toward competing against china, there was less unity on how adversarial a public position the group should take. canada, the united kingdom and france largely endorsed biden's position, while germany, italy and the european union showed more hesitancy during saturday's first session of the group of seven summit, according to two senior biden administration officials.  the officials who briefed reporters were not authorised to publicly discuss the private meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity. the communique that summarises the meeting's commitments was being written and the contents would not be clear until it was released when the summit ended sunday.  white house officials said late saturday that they believed that china, in some form, could be called out for ""nonmarket policies and human rights abuses"". in his first summit as president, biden made a point of carving out one-on-one-time with various leaders, bouncing from french president emmanuel macron to german chancellor angela merkel to italian prime minister mario draghi as well as japan's yoshihide suga and australia's scott morrison, a day after meeting with british prime minister boris johnson as if to personally try to ward off memories of the chaos that his predecessor would often bring to these gatherings. macron told biden that collaboration was needed on a range of issues and told the american president that ""it's great to have a us president part of the club and very willing to cooperate"".  relations between the allies had become strained during the four years of donald trump's presidency and his ""america first"" foreign policy. merkel, for her part, downplayed differences on china and the nord stream 2 pipeline which would transport natural gas from russia to germany, bypassing ukraine. ""the atmosphere is very cooperative, it is characterised by mutual interest,"" merkel said.  ""there are very good, constructive and very vivid discussions in the sense that one wants to work together. ""white house officials have said biden wants the leaders of the g7 nations — the us, britain, canada, france, germany, japan and italy — to speak in a single voice against forced labour practices targeting china's uyghur muslims and other ethnic minorities.  biden hopes the denunciation will be part of a joint statement to be released sunday when the summit ends, but some european allies are reluctant to split so forcefully with beijing. china had become one of the more compelling sublots of the wealthy nations' summit, their first since 2019.  last year's gathering was cancelled because of covid-19, and recovery from the pandemic is dominating this year's discussions, with leaders expected to commit to sharing at least 1 billion vaccine shots with struggling countries. the allies also took the first steps in presenting an infrastructure proposal called ""build back better for the world"", a name echoing biden's campaign slogan.  the plan calls for spending hundreds of billions of dollars in collaboration with the private sector while adhering to climate standards and labour practices. it's designed to compete with china's trillion-dollar ""belt and road initiative"" which has launched a network of projects and maritime lanes that snake around large portions of the world, primarily asia and africa.  critics say china's projects often create massive debt and expose nations to undue influence by beijing. britain also wants the world's democracies to become less reliant on the asian economic giant.  the uk government said saturday's discussions would tackle ""how we can shape the global system to deliver for our people in support of our values"", including by diversifying supply chains that currently heavily depend on china. not every european power has viewed china in as harsh a light as biden, who has painted the rivalry with china as the defining competition for the 21st century.  but there are some signs that europe is willing to impose greater scrutiny. before biden took office in january, the european commission announced it had come to terms with beijing on a deal meant to provide europe and china with greater access to each other's markets.  the biden administration had hoped to have consultations on the pact. but the deal has been put on hold, and the european union in march announcedsanctions targeting four chinese officialsinvolved with human rights abuses in xinjiang.  beijing responded with penalties on several members of the european parliament and other europeans critical of the chinese communist party. biden administration officials see an opportunity to take concrete action to speak out against china's reliance on forced labour as an ""affront to human dignity"". while calling out china in the g7 communique would not create any immediate penalties for beijing, one senior administration official said the action would send a message that the leaders were serious about defending human rights and working together to eradicate the use of forced labour. an estimated 1 million people or more — most of them uyghurs — have been confined in reeducation camps in china's western xinjiang region in recent years, according to researchers.  chinese authorities have been accused of imposing forced labor, systematic forced birth control, torture and separating children from incarcerated parents. beijing rejects allegations that it is committing crimes. johnson, the summit host, also welcomed the leaders from ""guest nations"" south korea, australia and south africa, as well as the head of the united nations, to the summit to ""intensify cooperation between the world's democratic and technologically advanced nations"". the leaders planned to attend a barbecue saturday night, complete with toasted marshmallows, hot buttered rum and a performance by a sea shanty troupe. india was also invited but its delegation is not attending in person because of the severe coronavirus outbreak in the country. biden ends the trip wednesday by meeting in geneva with russia's vladimir putin.  the white house announced saturday that they will not hold a joint news conference afterward, which removes the opportunity for comparisons to the availability that followed trump and putin's 2018 helsinki summit, in which trump sided with moscow over his own intelligence agencies.  only biden will address the news media after the meeting. putin, in an interview with nbc news, said the us-russia relationship had ""deteriorated to its lowest point in recent years"". he added that while trump was a ""talented"" and ""colourful"" person, biden was a ""career man"" in politics, which has ""some advantages, some disadvantages, but there will not be any impulse-based movements"" by the us president. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-13,Foreign businesses shocked by rollout of China's anti-sanctions law.,"china's quick rollout of a law against foreign sanctions has left european and american companies shocked and facing ""irreconcilable"" compliance issues, two top business groups said friday, despite beijing saying the move would unlikely impact investment. the law came into effect on thursday, adding to china's toolbox as it builds its defences against us and eu pressure over trade and human rights. the move also came just a week after us president joe biden expanded a blacklist of chinese companies in which americans are not allowed to invest -- allowing beijing to now hit back at those who formulate or comply with foreign sanctions. ""european companies in china are shocked by the lack of transparency and speed of this process,"" european chamber president joerg wuttke told afp, referring to the passing of the new law. with the fresh rules prohibiting organisations from implementing what beijing deems discriminatory and restrictive measures, ""foreign firms remain very much stuck between a rock and a hard place,"" he said. american chamber of commerce chairman greg gilligan cautioned that the new law ""presents potentially irreconcilable compliance problems for foreign companies"". rushing through a new law without an opportunity for public comment severely jeopardises foreign investor confidence in china's legal system as well, he added. but chinese foreign ministry spokesman wang wenbin told a regular press briefing on friday he did not see a definite link between the new law and foreign investment. ""if anything, the enactment of the anti-foreign sanctions law provides a predictable legal environment. . .  for foreign companies operating in china,"" he said. wuttke, however, warned that the action was not conducive to attracting investment, or in reassuring companies that ""already feel they may be used as sacrificial pawns in a game of political chess"". ""there is a real concern that this will further destabilise eu-china relations,"" he said. in the european chamber's latest business confidence survey released this week, 41 per cent of respondents said china's business environment had become more politicised last year. most reported they expect the situation to remain the same or deteriorate over the coming year. bys-ehl/jfxit is compulsory to have your car insured in singapore.  why not make the most of it by looking for the best car insurance plan in town when your policy is up for renewal? while it can be tempting to simply renew your existing car [. . . ] the post 5 best car insurance plans in singapore (2021) appeared first on singsaver blog we compare, you save. a 24-year-old man who was seen naked in public in several photos and videos circulating online has been arrested by the police. få flere penge i hverdagen ved at samle din gæld.  indsend en ansøgning her og få et tilbud.  indfri lånet når du ønsker det. what if china were to cut off the united states and europe from access to rare minerals that are essential to electric vehicles, wind turbines and drones?second minister for education maliki osman has taken to facebook to express his shock and disappointment at alleged islamophobic remarks made by a ngee ann polytechnic (np) lecturer. newly-crowned french open champion barbora krejcikova hailed her mentor and former wimbledon champion jana novotna who died in 2017, saying: ""at the end of her life, i had to be there.

""it's great personally, but it's a good start for us.  we would have liked to have won, but a draw from the first game puts us in a good position,"" said moore on the bbc. ""it's never good going a goal down, but to get one back and see the game out is a big positive for us.  it was tough in the heat, but it's what we expect in a hot climate being here for a week now. ""i'm enjoying it.  it's a big occasion.  i'm loving every second of it. ""breel embolo had terrorised the welsh defence and put switzerland ahead when he showed impressive strength to outmuscle defender connor roberts from a corner shortly after half-time. they also had a late goal by mario gavranovic correctly ruled out by the var (video assistant referee) for offside. the swiss may blame themselves for not killing off the game earlier, having squandered several golden chances through haris seferovic in the first half and embolo after the break. defender fabian schar had tried to beat goalkeeper danny ward with a cheeky flick before seferovic's 27th-minute curled shot sailed just over the bar. the forward squandered two more chances before half-time as the swiss notched 11 attempts to wales' two in the first half. what his teammates failed to achieve with finesse in the first half, embolo did with sheer power and speed in the 49th minute, heading in from a corner for a deserved lead after his powerful run and shot was saved by ward seconds earlier. ""we knew switzerland would have a lot of the ball and that we'd have to be solid and organised defensively,"" said wales' caretaker boss rob page told the bbc. ""we wanted a positive start and it feels like a win in the changing room.  i'm so proud of the players for digging so deep. ""with captain gareth bale well-marked throughout, they gradually upped the pressure in search of an equaliser as the swiss eased off and conceded some ground, and moore found the space to beat sommer with a glancing header. ""i feel a bit of frustration with the result, as we had the chances for the second goal but didn't take them,"" embolo said on uefa. com. ""perhaps we were too passive after the first goal.  we deserved the win, but it turned out to be a draw and that's a pity. ""we have to take the positives, rest, focus on the next game and bring the good things from this match into the next. ""italy lead the group after their impressive 3-0 victory over turkey in the tournament opener on friday and will host the swiss in rome in their second game on wednesday. wales stay in the azerbaijan capital to face the turks on the same day. reutersit was tough in the heat, but it's what we expect in a hot climate being here for a week now.  i'm enjoying it.  it's a big occasion.  i'm loving every second of it. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-13,"South-east Asia's race to vaccinate more than 650 million people, SE Asia News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore last year, several countries in south-east asia were among the poster boys for their deft handling of the covid-19 pandemic. now, they are battling a resurgence in infections. case numbers are still low compared with other hot spots like india and brazil but governments in the region, nonetheless, have initiated lockdowns and ramped up testing. they have also accelerated vaccination drives by rolling out public awareness campaigns, ironing out flaws in previous policies, scaling up inoculation efforts and dangling incentives all of which are part of the effort to protect their people and open up economies battered by the pandemic. ""south-east asia has done a wonderful job during the first wave of the pandemic but people later lowered their guard and this gave the virus free rein on the ground.  the governments have tried to ramp up their vaccination campaigns but with the exception of singapore they still have a long way to go,"" dr abhishek rimal, kuala lumpur-based regional emergency health coordinator at the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies (ifrc), told the straits times. singapore is the region's leader in vaccinations, with more than 30 per cent of the population fully vaccinated.  it has allowed children from the age of 12 to be vaccinated and month-long restrictions put in place to combat a spike in cases look set to be eased from monday (june 14). but many of singapore's neighbours are hampered by slow progress in their vaccination campaigns, with most having inoculated less than 10 per cent of their population. several countries are now working to speed up their efforts. indonesia, which has given out more than 30 million shots mostly to the elderly, health workers and those with disabilities is allowing old folk to turn up at any designated facility for a jab without prior registration, while offering shots to the young if they help bring in those aged 60 years and above to be inoculated. indonesia has asked china for technical assistance to help it become a regional production hub for the covid-19 vaccine.

malaysia, which is in the throes of another lockdown after registering record-high cases and deaths in recent weeks, has opened up mega vaccination centres to inoculate up to 8,000 people a day. vaccine trucks have been deployed to areas where people might find it difficult to get to an immunisation centre. close to four per cent of malaysia's 32 million population a total of 1. 22 million are now fully vaccinated. the government has said that 16 million vaccine doses will arrive in the next two months. thailand has set a target to administer 500,000 shots per day from this month, five times more than the previous daily average.  it has announced plans to open up the tourist resort of phuket next month for fully vaccinated tourists. the thai government has also allowed private and local administrative organisations to procure covid-19 vaccines, but only through approved agencies such as the national vaccine institute and the thai red cross society.

cambodia has mobilised the army to inoculate its citizens and the one millionth and two millionth vaccinated person received 10 million riel (s$3,244) each. laos has banned the purchase of covid-19 vaccines by private entities in order to stave off complaints about inequality in the country, while neighbouring vietnam once a model for its successful handling of the pandemic has appealed to the public to donate to a covid-19 vaccine fund as it struggles to contain a new wave of the disease.

the philippines has extended vaccinations to children aged between 12 and 15, while private firms are allowed to procure vaccines for their workers without having to donate part of their shipments to the government. in order to help shore up confidence in the vaccine programme and tackle the issue of vaccine hesitancy, local celebrities were roped in to get their jabs publicly, while some cities and towns went a step further by offering everything from cattle to land to property in a bid to entice people to get their jabs.

despite their best efforts to bump up vaccinations, countries in the region still face various challenges, chief among them getting enough vaccines. it is estimated that the region will need some 1. 4 billion doses to cover the entire population of more than 650 million, leading some analysts to caution that this would be a formidable challenge since the global demand for vaccines outstrips supply. some countries are only receiving their first stocks now.  impoverished timor leste received its first batch of vaccine doses from covax, comprising 24,000 astrazeneca doses, only on april 5 this year.  it received 100,000 doses of sinovac vaccines from china on june 7. covax is the world health organisation-led initiative to secure vaccine supplies for developing countries. ""slow vaccine roll-out will have critical consequences for south-east asia,"" ms hanh nguyen and mr james borton wrote in the international intelligence publication, geopolitical monitor, on may 25. ""for a region that relies heavily on export and tourism, the low vaccine coverage plus closed border policy mean countries will not open their economies soon, thus missing out on economic opportunities as the west gradually reopens. ""another issue has been competition between the west and china as beijing expands its vaccine diplomacy in the region.  apart from sales, china has donated vaccines to cambodia, laos, myanmar and the philippines. ""as of right now, china stands out in its vaccine diplomacy efforts a move that the global superpower will likely use to solidify its position within the south-east asia,"" mr shazwan mustafa kamal, a senior associate with political risk and public consultancy vriens & partners, told st. the united states has recently announced plans to donate seven million doses to south asia and south-east asia, while the g-7 is expected to donate one billion vaccine doses to the world's poorest countries.  but mr shazwan said western powers appeared to be playing catch-up to china. ""south-east asian nations will be in an unenviable position in balancing china's overtures as well as their relationships with the us,"" he added. dr kevin s. y.  tan, a visiting senior fellow at iseas-yusof ishak institute who has written about vaccination efforts in the region, said it is too early to ascertain whether china's vaccine diplomacy will lead to any significant geopolitical shifts. ""if the pandemic drags on and if other vaccine sources are somehow limited, there will naturally be a greater dependency on chinese vaccines.  such vaccine dependency, in the long run, may bolster china's standing among south-east asian nations,"" he told st. logistics is another major issue in a region marked by vastly different terrain, from modern cities to rural mountainous areas and far-flung islands. this comes on top of poor infrastructure and limited resources to distribute and store vaccines, a significant roadblock for rapid deployment, especially for last-mile delivery. experts fear that if this is not overcome, the overall recovery for any nation will be difficult and time-consuming, especially if coronavirus variants lead to new waves of infection. as such, it is important that governments ensure the necessary infrastructure is in place, said iseas' dr tan, especially for vaccines with ultra-cold storage requirements. ""but if such infrastructure is unrealistic at the moment, then a decision to use more 'logistically friendly' vaccines may be a pragmatic and feasible approach,"" said dr tan, who is also an adjunct faculty member at the school of global studies in thailand's thammasat university. another issue that could hamper the region's success in tamping down the virus is the ongoing civil unrest in myanmar.  political instability in the country has exacerbated an already overstretched healthcare system and observers fear it is in danger of turning into the next covid-19 epicentre. locals told st the military government has set up vaccination centres but not many people are turning up for the jabs due to high distrust of the military junta's capability to administer, store and transport the vaccines. many have also refused to get vaccinated as a mark of protest against the junta. ""i am not getting vaccinated as i do not trust the quality and efficacy of the vaccines after the coup.  my friends and family pretty much hold the same view as well,"" investment analyst ye salween, 31, told st. the jury is still out on whether the region can be fully vaccinated by the end of next year, a target set for the world by british prime minister boris johnson. ifrc's dr abhishek described it as an ""ambitious"" target while iseas' dr tan said to do so would require a ""colossal effort"" which can be achieved, but only with support from foreign countries. ""this is because not a single country in the region has come up with its own home-made vaccine against covid-19 so far.  as a region, we are still dependent on supplies and support from sources beyond south-east asia and this is a glaring vulnerability that may need to be addressed,"" said dr tan. professor paul tambyah, president of the asia-pacific society of clinical microbiology and infection, said locally manufactured vaccines were ""the obvious answer"", noting that middle-income countries such as indonesia, thailand and malaysia had well established vaccine-manufacturing capacity. ""the key has to be the trips waiver,"" he told st, referring to the world trade organisation's (wto) agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights that governs the transfer of property like movie rights or vaccine-manufacturing specifics. ""with the trips waiver on patents, south-east asian countries could rapidly scale up vaccine production. ""he added that, without the constraints of the patents, mass vaccination could be rolled out very quickly the way measles and polio vaccines, which were locally made, led to the virtual elimination of these diseases. as of now though, reports say malaysia and the philippines will experience delays in the delivery of the astrazeneca vaccine manufactured in thailand.  that is going to exacerbate the situation in the philippines, in particular, because some vaccination sites in the capital, manila, have been closed due to the shortage of vaccines. mr jose ma luis montesclaros, an associate research fellow at the s.  rajaratnam school of international studies, has suggested that asean should support the private sector to develop vaccine production capacity. ""i feel that expanding the supplies of vaccines is something that benefits not only the vaccine- producing/recipient countries, but the world over, given the interconnected nature of global trade and investments,"" he told st. ""the sooner countries are able to solve the health problem, the sooner they can begin working on economic recovery,"" he added. • allowing the elderly to go to any designated vaccination facility without prior registration. • younger indonesians are eligible for shots if they help bring in those aged 60 years and older to get vaccinated. • aiming to become a regional production hub for covid-19 vaccine. • set up mega vaccination centres that can inoculate up to 8,000 people a day. • deploying vaccine trucks to rural communities. • government has pledged 16 million doses of vaccines in the next two months. • targeting to administer 500,000 shots per day from this month, five times more than the previous daily average. • shopping malls and supermarkets are among the 25 vaccination sites in bangkok. • aiming to open up phuket for vaccinated tourists next month. • approved vaccinations for children between the ages of 12 and 15. • several towns and cities are offering cows, bags of rice, land and properties to entice people to get jabs. • deploying vaccine buses to reach poorer, less accessible districts. • residents sent text messages urging them to contribute to a covid-19 vaccine fund. • looking to buy covid-19 vaccine production technology and build a plant to supply vaccines for the covax programme. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

""pras intends to defend this case very vigorously and believes that when all of the facts are developed, a jury will conclude that this was a selective prosecution that has unfairly targeted mr michel and will exonerate him,"" michel's lawyer, benjamin brafman, said in a statement. with lauryn hill and wyclef jean, michel was a member of the fugees, which had some of the biggest hits of the 1990s. low and michel were previously charged in 2019 with seeking to funnel millions of dollars of low's money into the us presidential election as legitimate campaign contributions while hiding the actual source of the funds. prosecutors said the two men worked closely with trump fund-raiser elliott broidy, who pleaded guilty last year to illegally lobbying the trump administration to help low squelch the 1mdb investigation and to seek the extradition of wengui from the us trump pardoned broidy in january. the back-channel efforts failed.  low was indicted in 2018 on charges of conspiring to launder billions of dollars embezzled from 1mdb. low has denied wrongdoing and is considered a fugitive.  low had been a little-known financier who built an us$8 billion (s$10 billion)  fund intended to develop the malaysian economy.  authorities in the us and malaysia allege he spent the pilfered money on parties, sports cars, luxury properties and priceless art. goldman sachs group admitted its role in the scheme and its malaysia unit pleaded guilty last year, agreeing to pay more than us$2. 3 billion in financial penalties, the largest in american history for violating us anti-bribery laws.  the unit was sentenced on wednesday, triggering a us$1. 26 billion payment for goldman sachs for the remaining fines. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-13,Biden urges G-7 leaders to call out and compete with China.,"keep up to speed at a glance with the top 10 daily storieskeep up to speed at a glance with the top 10 daily storiescarbis bay, england (ap) — leaders of the world's largest economies unveiled an infrastructure plan saturday for the developing world to compete with china's global initiatives, but they were searching for a consensus on how to forcefully to call out beijing over human rights abuses. citing china for its forced labor practices is part of president joe biden's campaign to persuade fellow democratic leaders to present a more unified front to compete economically with beijing.  but while they agreed to work toward competing against china, there was less unity on how adversarial a public position the group should take. canada, the united kingdom and france largely endorsed biden's position, while germany, italy and the european union showed more hesitancy during saturday's first session of the group of seven summit, according to two senior biden administration officials.  the officials who briefed reporters were not authorized to publicly discuss the private meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity. the communique that summarizes the meeting's commitments was being written and the contents would not be clear until it was released when the summit ended sunday.  white house officials said late saturday that they believed that china, in some form, could be called out for ""nonmarket policies and human rights abuses. ""in his first summit as president, biden made a point of carving out one-on-one-time with various leaders, bouncing from french president emmanuel macron to german chancellor angela merkel to italian prime minister mario draghi as well as japan's yoshihide suga and australia's scott morrison, a day after meeting with british prime minister boris johnson as if to personally try to ward off memories of the chaos that his predecessor would often bring to these gatherings. macron told biden that collaboration was needed on a range of issues and told the american president that ""it's great to have a u. s.  president part of the club and very willing to cooperate. "" relations between the allies had become strained during the four years of donald trump's presidency and his ""america first"" foreign policy. merkel, for her part, downplayed differences on china and the nord stream 2 pipeline which would transport natural gas from russia to germany, bypassing ukraine. ""the atmosphere is very cooperative, it is characterized by mutual interest,"" merkel said.  ""there are very good, constructive and very vivid discussions in the sense that one wants to work together. ""white house officials have said biden wants the leaders of the g-7 nations — the u. s. , britain, canada, france, germany, japan and italy — to speak in a single voice against forced labor practices targeting china's uyghur muslims and other ethnic minorities.  biden hopes the denunciation will be part of a joint statement to be released sunday when the summit ends, but some european allies are reluctant to split so forcefully with beijing. china had become one of the more compelling sublots of the wealthy nations' summit, their first since 2019.  last year's gathering was canceled because of covid-19, and recovery from the pandemic is dominating this year's discussions, with leaders expected to commit to sharing at least 1 billion vaccine shots with struggling countries. the allies also took the first steps in presenting an infrastructure proposal called ""build back better for the world,"" a name echoing biden's campaign slogan.  the plan calls for spending hundreds of billions of dollars in collaboration with the private sector while adhering to climate standards and labor practices. it's designed to compete with china's trillion-dollar ""belt and road initiative,"" which has launched a network of projects and maritime lanes that snake around large portions of the world, primarily asia and africa.  critics say china's projects often create massive debt and expose nations to undue influence by beijing. britain also wants the world's democracies to become less reliant on the asian economic giant.  the u. k.  government said saturday's discussions would tackle ""how we can shape the global system to deliver for our people in support of our values,"" including by diversifying supply chains that currently heavily depend on china. not every european power has viewed china in as harsh a light as biden, who has painted the rivalry with china as the defining competition for the 21st century.  but there are some signs that europe is willing to impose greater scrutiny. before biden took office in january, the european commission announced it had come to terms with beijing on a deal meant to provide europe and china with greater access to each other's markets.  the biden administration had hoped to have consultations on the pact. but the deal has been put on hold, and the european union in march announced sanctions targeting four chinese officials involved with human rights abuses in xinjiang.  beijing responded with penalties on several members of the european parliament and other europeans critical of the chinese communist party. biden administration officials see an opportunity to take concrete action to speak out against china's reliance on forced labor as an ""affront to human dignity. ""while calling out china in the g-7 communique would not create any immediate penalties for beijing, one senior administration official said the action would send a message that the leaders were serious about defending human rights and working together to eradicate the use of forced labor. an estimated 1 million people or more — most of them uyghurs — have been confined in reeducation camps in china's western xinjiang region in recent years, according to researchers.  chinese authorities have been accused of imposing forced labor, systematic forced birth control, torture and separating children from incarcerated parents. beijing rejects allegations that it is committing crimes. johnson, the summit host, also welcomed the leaders from ""guest nations"" south korea, australia and south africa, as well as the head of the united nations, to the summit to ""intensify cooperation between the world's democratic and technologically advanced nations. ""the leaders planned to attend a barbecue saturday night, complete with toasted marshmallows, hot buttered rum and a performance by a sea shanty troupe. india was also invited but its delegation is not attending in person because of the severe coronavirus outbreak in the country. biden ends the trip wednesday by meeting in geneva with russia's vladimir putin.  the white house announced saturday that they will not hold a joint news conference afterward, which removes the opportunity for comparisons to the availability that followed trump and putin's 2018 helsinki summit, in which trump sided with moscow over his own intelligence agencies.  only biden will address the news media after the meeting. putin, in an interview with nbc news, said the u. s. -russia relationship had ""deteriorated to its lowest point in recent years. ""he added that while trump was a ""talented"" and ""colorful"" person, biden was a ""career man"" in politics, which has ""some advantages, some disadvantages, but there will not be any impulse-based movements"" by the u. s.  president. ___lemire reported from plymouth, england.  associated press writers danica kirka and sylvia hui in falmouth, england, contributed to this report. china's quick rollout of a law against foreign sanctions has left european and american companies shocked and facing ""irreconcilable"" compliance issues, two top business groups said friday, despite beijing saying the move would unlikely impact investment. it is compulsory to have your car insured in singapore.  why not make the most of it by looking for the best car insurance plan in town when your policy is up for renewal? while it can be tempting to simply renew your existing car [. . . ] the post 5 best car insurance plans in singapore (2021) appeared first on singsaver blog we compare, you save. du kan få flere penge i hverdagen, hvis du samler dine lån og kreditter i et samlelån.  indsend en uforpligtende ansøgning i dag. a 24-year-old man who was seen naked in public in several photos and videos circulating online has been arrested by the police. second minister for education maliki osman has taken to facebook to express his shock and disappointment at alleged islamophobic remarks made by a ngee ann polytechnic (np) lecturer. newly-crowned french open champion barbora krejcikova hailed her mentor and former wimbledon champion jana novotna who died in 2017, saying: ""at the end of her life, i had to be there.

infrastructure plan saturday for the developing world to compete with china's global initiatives, but they were searching for a consensus on how to forcefully to call out beijing over human rights abuses."", ""citing china for its forced labor practices is part of president joe biden's campaign to persuade fellow democratic leaders to present a more unified front to compete economically with beijing."", 'but while they agreed to work toward competing against china, there was less unity on how adversarial a public position the group should take.', ""canada, the united kingdom and france largely endorsed biden's position, while germany, italy and the european union showed more hesitancy during saturday's first session of the group of seven summit, according to two senior biden administration officials."", 'the officials who briefed reporters were not authorized to publicly discuss the private meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity.', ""the communique that summarizes the meeting's commitments was being written and the contents would not be clear until it was released when the summit ended sunday."", 'white house officials said late saturday that they believed that china, in some form, could be called out for ""nonmarket policies and human rights abuses.', '""in his first summit as president, biden made a point of carving out one-on-one-time with various leaders, bouncing from french president emmanuel macron to german chancellor angela merkel to italian prime minister mario draghi as well as japan\'s yoshihide suga and australia\'s scott morrison, a day after meeting with british prime minister boris johnson as if to personally try to ward off memories of the chaos that his predecessor would often bring to these gatherings.', 'macron told biden that collaboration was needed on a range of issues and told the american president that ""it\'s great to have a u. s.  president part of the club and very willing to cooperate. ""', 'relations between the allies had become strained during the four years of donald trump\'s presidency and his ""america first"" foreign policy.', 'merkel, for her part, downplayed differences on china and the nord stream 2 pipeline which would transport natural gas from russia to germany, bypassing ukraine.', '""the atmosphere is very cooperative, it is characterized by mutual interest,"" merkel said.', '""there are very good, constructive and very vivid discussions in the sense that one wants to work together.', '""white house officials have said biden wants the leaders of the g-7 nations — the u. s. , britain, canada, france, germany, japan and italy — to speak in a single voice against forced labor practices targeting china\'s uyghur muslims and other ethnic minorities.', 'biden hopes the denunciation will be part of a joint statement to be released sunday when the summit ends, but some european allies are reluctant to split so forcefully with beijing.', ""china had become one of the more compelling sublots of the wealthy nations' summit, their first since 2019.  last year's gathering was canceled because of covid-19, and recovery from the pandemic is dominating this year's discussions, with leaders expected to commit to sharing at least 1 billion vaccine shots with struggling countries."", 'the allies also took the first steps in presenting an infrastructure proposal called ""build back better for the world,"" a name echoing biden\'s campaign slogan.', 'the plan calls for spending hundreds of billions of dollars in collaboration with the private sector while adhering to climate standards and labor practices.', 'it\'s designed to compete with china\'s trillion-dollar ""belt and road initiative,"" which has launched a network of projects and maritime lanes that snake around large portions of the world, primarily asia and africa.', ""critics say china's projects often create massive debt and expose nations to undue influence by beijing."", ""britain also wants the world's democracies to become less reliant on the asian economic giant."", 'the u. k.  government said saturday\'s discussions would tackle ""how we can shape the global system to deliver for our people in support of our values,"" including by diversifying supply chains that currently heavily depend on china.', 'not every european power has viewed china in as harsh a light as biden, who has painted the rivalry with china as the defining competition for the 21st century.', 'but there are some signs that europe is willing to impose greater scrutiny.', ""before biden took office in january, the european commission announced it had come to terms with beijing on a deal meant to provide europe and china with greater access to each other's markets."", 'the biden administration had hoped to have consultations on the pact.', 'but the deal has been put on hold, and the european union in march announced sanctions targeting four chinese officials involved with

2021-06-13,'Dominant' Italy get Euro 2020 off to impressive start against Turkey.,"italy got their euro 2020 campaign off the mark with an impressive 3-0 win over turkey in the curtain-raiser for the postponed continental tournament in front of their home fans in rome on friday. playing their first major tournament in five years after failing to qualify for the 2018 world cup, all the goals came in the second half in front of a stadio olimpico that was filled to a quarter of its capacity. merih demiral's own goal put italy ahead before ciro immobile and lorenzo insigne netted for roberto mancini's side in the group a opener. the win capped an emotional night in the italian capital which saw 16,000 fans return to the stadio olimpico. ""it was important to start well in rome and i think it's a satisfaction for the public and for italians,"" said mancini, whose side are now on a 28-match unbeaten run. ""there was a lot of help from the crowd.  it was a beautiful evening, i hope there are many others, but there are still six more for wembley. """"we were hoping for another result, but italy was dominant,"" said turkey coach senol gunes. ""the first goal changed things in the second half and we lost control of the game. ""there was a party atmosphere, with a spectacular sound and light show and firework display before kick-off for the opening of the month-long 24-team event, which will be played across 11 countries. there was a performance by the italian national police orchestra, a parade of huge inflatable balloons on the pitch, tenor andrea bocelli sang 'nessun dorma' before a virtual performance from martin garrix, bono and the edge. former italy world cup winners alessandro nesta and francesco totti, who played for lazio and roma during their careers at the stadio olimpico, carried the ball to the centre of the pitch before kick-off. berardi impresses -on the pitch, italy dominated early on with a three-man attack led by immobile, who plays for lazio. the 31-year-old had several near misses in the first half, coming up against a solid turkey defence who held their own. turkey could also thank goalkeeper ugurcan cakir for pulling off a big save on 23 minutes, tipping over italy captain giorgio chiellini's powerful goal-bound header off an insigne corner. italy finally got on the scoreboard eight minutes after the break when the unfortunate demiral found himself in the path of a federico berardi cross for immobile, the juventus defender bundling the ball into his own net. leonardo spinazzola had a chance for a second minutes later, with immobile sending the rebound wide. immobile finally got his goal, his 14th for italy, and first in a major tournament, in the 66th minute, scoring from a rebound after cakir had saved from spinazzola. and insigne curled in the third with 11 minutes to go. sassuolo winger berardi had a role in all three goals, with italy scoring three for the first time in a european championship match. all three italy forwards proved efficient on the night with a defence organised around juventus veterans chiellini and leonardo bonucci holding firm, securing a ninth straight clean sheet. ""we struggled at the start, we tried to accelerate but we hit a wall,"" said immobile. ""in the second half, they were a little more tired, they tried to rush us but the spaces opened up, and we saw our quality at that time. ""gianluigi donnarumma was largely unworried in the italy goal apart from a dangerous burak yilmaz cross after half an hour and a solo run by cengiz under after coming off the bench after the break. ""from a tactical point of view, italy was superior,"" said gunes. ""italy mastered the pitch and the ball.  they suffocated us with pressing and high pace, and they took advantage of playing at home. ""we have to react now.

2021-06-13,Football: Moore grabs point for Wales in Euro 2020 opener with Switzerland.,"baku: a header from towering kieffer moore claimed a point for wales in a 1-1 draw with switzerland in baku on saturday (jun 12) to start both teams' euro 2020 campaigns. moore responded to breel embolo's second-half opener with a quarter of an hour remaining.  both sides trail group a leaders italy, who beat turkey 3-0 in friday's tournament curtain-raiser. wales coach robert page named gareth bale on the left wing as the real madrid attacker was one of three wales survivors in the starting line-up from the 2016 semi-final loss to portugal. switzerland boss vladimir petkovic kept benfica's haris seferovic and borussia moenchengladbach's breel embolo up front despite mario gavranovic scoring four times in two pre-tournament friendlies. with petkovic naming a narrow back three, bale and fellow winger dan james found space out wide early on in front of an estimated 10,000 crowd as local authorities allowed up to 50-percent capacity in the 69,000-seater olympic stadium. after a quarter of an hour played, james broke free down the left before finding 1. 95 metre-tall moore who forced swiss goalkeeper yann sommer to tip the ball over the bar. from the resulting corner, moore rose highest again and clashed in the air with manuel akanji, which left the cardiff forward playing the remainder of the game with red tape around his head. with moore bandaged, the momentum swung towards petkovic's side and they dominated the remainder of the half but seferovic wasted three chances. moore returned after the interval despite completing just one of his team's 101 passes in the first half. petkovic's switzerland, who reached the last 16 five years ago, remained in control with captain granit xhaka, liverpool's xherdan shaqiri and atalanta's remo freuler dominating midfield. embolo sparks to lifethey broke the deadlock four minutes into the second half as embolo sparked into life after a quiet opening 45 minutes. he broke down the middle and forced danny ward into a save, which gave shaqiri a corner on the right flank. he delivered to embolo who headed home after beating wales right-back connor roberts with ease for just his sixth goal in 44 international appearances. shaqiri, who played just 14 premier league games for liverpool last season, was substituted on 66 minutes for the more defensive denis zakaria. despite petkovic's pragmatic change in personnel, wales equalised with 16 minutes remaining. manchester united's james played a corner short which ended up at joe morrell's feet and he crossed into the box. moore lost his marker and headed a well-placed effort passed the out-stretched sommer to send the roughly 300 travelling wales fans into a frenzy behind the opposite goal. james was then replaced by david brooks as both sides searched for a winner. seferovic was substituted for 31-year-old gavranovic on 84 minutes and the dinamo zagreb forward thought he had claimed all three points for his side with his first touch. after edging past the wales backline he beat ward but his effort was chalked off for offside by var. switzerland pressed on in five minutes of injury time and gavranovic was denied another potential winner, this time ward saving with his finger tips. ramsey left the field for ethan ampadu during time added on and page's men held on for a point. wales stay in baku for their next game when they face turkey on wednesday, with switzerland taking on italy in rome later that day. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-13,Commentary: A precious chance to see my ageing mother in Germany after being separated by COVID-19.,"the pandemic has been particularly cruel to families separated by distance – with borders closed and travel tedious and costly, some never have the chance to hold their loved ones.  greg lim-lange is glad he had the chance. singapore: it is not normal for a son to ask: ""when is my mother going to die?"" or ""will i be able to see her before the inevitable fate that awaits us all sooner or later?""but i have had to ask this difficult question because like many people, i live thousands of miles away from my mother. i have lived here for 12 years, while my mother, who turns 85 this year, lives in germany. since the beginning of the pandemic, my singaporean wife and i had been waiting for countries to control the virus, for travel to ""normalise"", and to able to fly and meet her. but by may 2021, i hadn't seen her in almost two years. for those of us separated from families, there were windows of hope that could have enabled a trip home relatively low covid-19 numbers in singapore, a potential travel bubble via hong kong where business opportunities there mean we can avoid a lengthy quarantine after spending some time there, and vaccines being rapidly developed. but not only did numbers increase, the travel bubble burst twice, dashing many hopes.  the fluidity in the covid-19 situation has meant unpredictable changes to travel restrictions since last year. at the height of the pandemic for instance, singapore closed its borders to all short-term visitors.  this year, when the mutant strains raised infection numbers again, singaporeans and permanent residents had to test negative before flying back. even if we took the risk to travel, there was a nagging fear – what if during my travel, i catch the virus and then bring it home to my mum? or what if i pass it on to my wife? how long should i wait before it is safe – knowing that there would never really be a ""right time""?taking the risk to travelthe good news is vaccinations became available and my mother was first in line to receive her shots in freiburg, a small city nestled in the black forest in the south of germany.  i myself got fully vaccinated by may. the possibility of a trip came into sharper focus.  however, there were still logistical challenges and uncertainties involved in making the trip. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid. should i go alone or go together with my wife?  what if there is another outbreak and singapore changes entry re-entry requirements? how about work – we could not be away indefinitely and needed contingency plans. my wife and i decided to travel together.  it helped that we are self-employed and could do some work remotely. yet, shortly after we booked our tickets and just days before our departure, things took a turn for the worse.  germany went into a hard lockdown as numbers there spiralled.  the new and more contagious variants of the virus also arrived in singapore. germany required a negative pre-flight covid-19 test no earlier than 48 hours before arrival. with pcr tests taking up to two days to process, we scheduled not one but two tests to be taken just in case of a rare false positive.  it would be terrible to have come this far and then be turned around at the airport before we could enter germany. meanwhile the new restrictions in germany to stop transmission meant that all restaurants, shops, and hotels were closed and there was even a curfew in place from 10pm to 6am every night.  so again, there was the concern of being infected and the thought of whether we should still go or postpone came to mind. we had just 12 hours to decide.  all our covid-19 tests had come back negative and we stuck to what mattered most – using this opportunity to see my mother, who had been waiting for two years to be reunited with us. an eerie journeyit was an eerie journey through empty hallways at changi airport with personnel in full ppe, and always a niggling concern in the back of my mind whether we would be let through the immigration controls in germany. with a pandemic that throws up spikes in cases without warning, what was the chance of new regulations mid-flight barring all visitors or new quarantine requirements which so far had not been the case in germany?perhaps it was good that our anxieties were also hidden behind our masks that we were required to wear for the entire flight except for mealtimes.   this clearly wasn't joyful travelling as it used to be. in the end, the journey there went smoothly, the immigration officer glanced at our test results and apologised for the new restrictions and we got through immigration within minutes.  after a two-and-a-half-hour ride on a strangely empty autobahn, we arrived at my mother's home. she burst into tears of joy hugging me tightly after being separated for so long and my wife caught this moment of pure joy on camera. our journey to germany really brought home the point that we are wired to connect with our loved ones physically.  no video call can ever replace the feeling of being held by a loved one or the taste of a mother's meal. my mother had already been cooking our favourite dishes for a week before we arrived in anticipation. the return journeyonly a few days after arriving in germany, the compulsory 14-day quarantine in singapore was changed to 21 days. then there was a big cluster at changi airport and we started to worry if the airport might be closed under a new circuit breaker.  the following week we learned that non- singaporeans or prs would not be allowed to re-enter singapore until august. for some of our international friends currently travelling, that meant that they could not even return to their business or loved ones in singapore. my wife and i remained apprehensive about our journey home – our children were waiting for us.  we kept checking online if any new requirements cropped up before boarding our flight home. we made it back safely and changi airport was even emptier than we remembered.  well-organised as always, immigration and testing upon arrival went quite smoothly as a small army of helpful guides walked alongside us and directed us to every station we needed to pass, from immigration to swab test to our shuttle bus. was this arduous journey filled with twists, turns and worries worth it?i would say yes – my time with my mother was so very precious.  the two weeks we were there went by so quickly.  i didn't have the courage to tell her how much death was on my mind or how my fears of uncertainty were bothering me. i simply stayed with her, listened to her, ate all her lovingly prepared dishes and held her tight. i know we are very privileged to be able to spend the time and the money needed to see our loved ones. my heart goes out to the many more who are stuck in this pandemic limbo with one lockdown after another, still connecting using technology and yearning for the time they can take a trip to finally hold each other again. dr gregor lim-lange is the co-founder and chief psychologist of forest wolf an expert on clinical and positive psychology, social emotional intelligence and mental health.

belgium's romelu lukaku celebrates scoring their third goal against russia at the gazprom arena, saint petersburg june 12, 2021.  — reuters pic

follow us on instagram and subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates. saint petersburg, june 13 — belgium striker romelu lukaku sent a message of support to his stricken inter milan team-mate christian eriksen after scoring, as his double helped the red devils open their euro 2020 campaign with a 3-0 win over russia on saturday. lukaku gave belgium an early lead in saint petersburg, then shouted ""chris, chris, stay strong — i love you"" into a pitchside camera during the celebration for his opening goal. his club team-mate eriksen is recovering in hospital in copenhagen after collapsing on the pitch during extraordinary scenes which overshadowed denmark's 1-0 home defeat by finland in saturday's earlier group b game. substitute thomas meunier doubled belgium's lead on 34 minutes before lukaku put the result beyond doubt with a late second goal. belgium, the world's top-ranked team, are under pressure to deliver at the european championship as some pundits claim this is roberto martinez's last chance to win a title with an ageing squad. yet even with manchester city playmaker kevin de bruyne and borussia dortmund midfielder axel witsel sidelined by injury, belgium were too strong for russia. the hosts got off to a bad start when andrei semenov failed to deal with a cross by dries mertens in the build-up to the opening goal. the ball fell to lukaku, who span away and drove his shot into the bottom far corner on 10 minutes. belgium's timothy castagne and russia's daler kuzyaev had to be helped off following a nasty clash of heads which saw both players substituted. meunier, castagne's replacement at right-back, grabbed belgium's second by slotting home the rebound after his dortmund team-mate thorgan hazard swung in a cross which anton shunin failed to hold. it stayed 2-0 at the break, but russia raised the tempo in the second half as roman zobnin fired over the belgian goal. real madrid star eden hazard replaced mertens for the final 18 minutes to lift the belgian attack. with two minutes left, lukaku swept meunier's pass into the russian net to claim his 20th goal in his last 15 international games. before kick-off, the belgium team were booed for taking a knee to highlight racial injustice, while their russian opponents stood. jeers echoed around the krestovsky stadium as the entire belgian team, as well as spanish referee antonio mateu lahoz, knelt, while lukaku, whose parents come from the democratic republic of congo, raised his right fist. england have said they will do the same for their opening game of the european championship against croatia on sunday. ex-nfl quarterback colin kaepernick started kneeling to protest against racial injustice in 2016. the gesture has become a familiar sight across a range of sports since george floyd, who was black, was killed by a white police officer in the united states last year.  — reutersloading. . . © 2021, malay mail, all rights reserved.

""so everybody needs some encouragement, especially our front-liners who don't have the opportunity to work from home to stay safe,"" she said. ""their jobs and livelihoods are tied to what they do at the front line.

2021-06-13,‘Light at the end of the tunnel’: Fitness studios cheer resumption of indoor mask-off activities.,"singapore: owners of gyms and fitness studios have welcomed news that indoor mask-off activities will be allowed to resume on jun 21, describing it as a relief after weeks of tightened curbs. the easing of restrictions was announced on thursday (jun 10) as part of singapore's plans to enterphase 3 (heightened alert)after a fall in the number of covid-19 community cases. this will take place in two phases: social gathering group sizes will be increased from jun 14; and if the situation remains under control, other restrictions such as the resumption of dining-in and other higher-risk mask-off activities will be allowed a week later on jun 21. mr shane parsons, the co-owner of fitness studio f45 lower peirce reservoir, said the news was a pleasant surprise as he had been ""prepared for the worst"". ""we were all feeling kind of lost every time these lockdown restrictions happened.  so . . .  at least we feel we're moving in a positive direction again. ""by jun 21, it'll be over six weeks with nearly zero revenue – that's been tough . . .  ultimately, we can see the light at the end of the tunnel,"" said mr parsons. under current tightened measures forphase two (heightened alert), from may 16 to jun 13, only low-intensity physical activities are allowed at gyms and fitness studios – with masks on at all times. that means studios focusing on high-intensity workouts, such as mr parson's, have been unable to operate as per normal. the same goes for ritual, a gym chain with four locations in singapore, which has been operating at 20 per cent of its usual capacity, said its ceo, mr brad robinson. ""for us to be able to edge closer back to our typical business model (of high-intensity workouts) and normalcy was obviously met with happiness across the board. ""mr saumik bera, the director of real yoga, added: ""i felt like i could breathe (again), because this phase 2 was like a coma to me, and all of us. ""new measures in placewhen indoor mask-off sports activities resume, participants will need to be at least 2m apart from each other. indoor and outdoor sports classes can also be held in multiple groups of five – with a cap of 30 people, including the instructor.  the groups have to be at least 3m apart. businesses cna spoke to said they are prepared for this, as similar social distancing rules were introduced when singapore entered phase 2 last year. come jun 21, employees of such places will also have to be regularly tested for covid-19, due to the higher-risk settings. like other fitness studio owners, real yoga's mr bera agreed with the need for this: ""we see quite a number of people every day and don't know who carries what kinds of viruses, so i'm supportive of this that the frontliners should be responsible to protect society. ""the government will cover the cost of these tests for the next three months. beyond that, employers will have to ""start thinking about incorporating these processes as part of their business continuity plans"", said finance minister lawrence wong on thursday at a press conference by the multi-ministry task force on covid-19. these costs,  on top of capacity constraints, will have an impact on business, said f45 lower peirce reservoir's mr parsons.  but he added that the studio will do ""whatever it takes to keep moving forward"". ritual's mr robinson also said: ""we're all for anything that allows our business to get back to pre-pandemic revenue, or as close to it as possible. ""our cost base has gone up and revenue has gone down so that's obviously a double whammy.  but again . . .  you adapt to just survive and move ahead. ""he added that details of the testing regime, including costs, have yet to be revealed. ms yang jiamin, the founder of jyan yoga, suggested that the subsidies should be extended. ""three months is definitely not enough, considering covid has been around for a year already and we don't know when it's going to go away, or how this is going to be the new norm for us. ""to be more reasonable, probably about six months to a year (of subsidies) would be good. ""another suggestion from mr parson: ""if gyms and fitness studios are really considered higher-risk settings, then workers should be prioritised for early vaccination. ""adapting to phase 3 (heightened alert)fitness studios are gearing up to welcome more members, but they do not expect business to bounce back immediately. real yoga's mr bera said he anticipates that ""many will still be afraid to come out of the house"".  so while there will be more in-person classes, online classes will be kept as a staple. jyan yoga's ms yang is also working on ways to bring members back. ""we are adding new classes to our curriculum to entice people to come down to the studio,"" she said, adding that they are also working on new merchandise that will compliment these in-person classes. ritual and f45 lower peirce reservoir are also only expecting a gradual return of customers. still, an in-person experience is key because it helps cultivate a sense of community – part of the appeal of gyms and fitness studios, said f45's mr parsons. ""after 3m distancing, masks on, and no shared equipment . . .  we can't wait for a day in the future when all of this behind us and our members are giving high-fives after class, freely going off and have dinner and drinks after"". downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

                    saturday, 12 jun 2021
                kuala lumpur (bernama): the government is expected to cover fuel and cooking oil subsidies up to rm8bil, which is rm4. 22bil more than the initial rm3. 78bil allocated for this year. the government has spent rm6. 32bil on fuel and cooking oil subsidies in 2019 and rm2. 16bil for 2020. finance minister tengku datuk seri zafrul abdul aziz said the higher allocation this year was due to the increase in current global market prices. following the increase in commodity prices globally, government subsidies for ron95 petroleum products, diesel and liquefied petroleum gas (lpg) as well as subsidised cooking oil are expected to increase sharply. ""the government is prepared to bear the higher subsidy expenditure to preserve the well-being of the people and the viability of businesses, especially small traders,"" the finance ministry said in a statement on saturday (june 12). tengku zafrul said the government would continue to help the people through various measures, including continuing to subsidise fuel and cooking oil to help reduce the impact of rising commodity prices globally on the people's cost of living. he said the government would continue with the price maintenance policy of rm2. 05 per litre for ron95 petrol and rm2. 15 per litre for diesel which had been maintained since feb 10. meanwhile, the price of lpg was maintained at rm1. 90 per kg since june 2015 and subsidised cooking oil was worth rm2. 50 per one kg pack since 1997, he said. he added that various budget 2021 measures and improved initiatives through permai, pemerkasa and pemerkasa plus will continue to be channelled at least until december 2021. bernama

""mr.  roberts was part of a group of over 1,400 people who set sail in 11 ships from portsmouth, england on may 13, 1787 — part of the infamous ""first fleet"" — transporting military leaders, sailors and convicts across the world. ""a wide variety of people made up this legendary 'first fleet,'"" according to the national geographic society.  ""military and government officials, along with their wives and children, led the group.  sailors, cooks, masons and other workers hoped to establish new lives in the new colony. ""the first fleet included more than 700 convicts — the start of what would be more than 80 years of britain's shipping off convicts to serve out their sentences in new south wales, now a state in southeastern australia.  britain sent more than 160,000 convicts to australia in that time, and it is estimated that about 20 percent of present-day australians can trace their ancestry to them. mr.  morrison is not the first australian leader to trace his roots back to a convict. genealogists traced former prime minister kevin rudd's family line to an english woman who barely escaped the hangman's noose.  in 1788, mary wade — mr.  rudd's paternal fifth-great-grandmother — was convicted at the old bailey in london of having robbed an 8-year-old girl of her dress and underwear in a bathroom. ms.  wade is said to have declared at her trial: ""i was in a good mind to have chucked her down"" the toilet.  ""i wish i had done so. ""she was sentenced ""to be hanged by the neck til she be dead,"" but her sentence was commuted and she was shipped off to australia.

""the decision was taken after taking into account daily cases are still over 5,000,"" he said. he did not say which period of time the average daily figure of 6,871 was based on. datuk seri ismail sabri added that regulations such as bans on inter-district travel and social activities and cuts to workplace staff capacity would continue from the existing lockdown that began on june 1 and was set to expire after next monday. ""i hope there is no more confusion on the enforcement of standard operating procedures (sop).  i don't want the public to be affected by misinterpretation of the sops by the authorities,"" he said. the lockdown, which allows only 17 economic sectors to operate, was imposed after a looser movement control order (mco) last month failed to curb malaysia's worst coronavirus wave, with both public and private healthcare resources overrun by a record number of active cases.  instead, may has been the deadliest month so far, logging more than a third of the 3,768 fatalities recorded in total. the health ministry reported 6,849 new cases yesterday, the highest this week, bringing the total to 646,411, with a record 912 currently warded in intensive care units. malaysia's lockdown, dubbed a full mco (fmco), would have ended its first phase next monday had the health ministry's risk assessment based on infection rates and hospital capacities deemed that the curbs were successful in reducing infection numbers. the ministry said on wednesday that the rate of transmission had dipped just below 1. 0 to 0. 96, indicating that the number of new patients daily was decreasing slowly. once malaysia ends the fmco, a second phase lasting four weeks will follow, with more economic sectors that do not involve mass gatherings allowed to reopen. should the situation continue to improve, malaysia will see a further easing to something similar to last month's mco, in which most economic activities subject to sops and health protocols were allowed, while social activities remained banned. however, malaysia's long-term exit strategy from mco restrictions largely revolves around achieving herd immunity before the end of the year. after a slow start, the national covid-19 immunisation programme has steadily increased the rate of doses administered daily, with 157,949 receiving jabs on thursday.  over 2. 8 million people, or nearly 12 per cent of the adult population, have had at least one dose.

2021-06-13,Football: Denmark's Christian Eriksen 'awake' in hospital after collapse in Euro 2020 game.,"copenhagen: denmark star christian eriksen was awake in hospital, the danish football union said on saturday, after he collapsed on the pitch during the euro 2020 game against finland in copenhagen. ""christian eriksen is awake and is undergoing further tests"" at the hospital, the danish federation said on twitter, after the player was carried off the field having received cpr by medical personnel. a reuters photographer at the game saw eriksen raise his hand as he was carried from the pitch on a stretcher. eriksen collapsed suddenly in the 42nd minute of the match while running near the left touchline. teammates martin braithwaite and thomas delaney rushed to assist him, with delaney beckoning furiously for medical assistance. the midfielder's teammates formed a ring around him as medics pumped his chest just before halftime in their group b clash with the finns. both teams subsequently left the field with officials holding up sheets to hide the stricken player from view. ""the uefa euro 2020 match in copenhagen has been suspended due to a medical emergency,"" uefa said in a short statement. about half an hour later, the organisation tweeted that eriksen ""has been transferred to the hospital and has been stabilised"". ""a crisis meeting has taken place with both teams and match officials,"" it added. the match restarted at 2. 30am singapore time.  uefa said that it had agreed to restart the match ""following the request made by players of both teams"". finland won 1-0 with their only goal attempt of the match. eriksen was later able to speak to his teammates. ""we've been in contact with him, and the players have spoken to christian.  that's the great news.  he's doing fine, and they are playing the game for him,"" dbu director peter moeller told danish television. eriksen was voted man of the match in a gesture of support. ""moments like this put everything in life into perspective,"" said uefa president aleksander ceferin. the previously raucous crowd at the parken stadium in the danish capital fell silent after the 29-year-old fell to the ground near the end of the opening period, with his teammates gathering around him. team doctor morten boesen said at the press conference that eriksen received life-saving cardiac massage on the pitch. after around 15 minutes eriksen was stretchered off the field followed by the rest of the denmark team, while finland's players also left the pitch. the fans in the stadium, who were celebrating the chance to see their national team again live at the stadium, sat silently in their seats waiting for news of eriksen's condition to filter through. however soon after stadium-wide chants of ""christian"" and ""eriksen"" from both sets of supporters began to ring out as his status began to filter through to supporters. they were brought to their feet when stadium announcers said that eriksen was ""stable"". it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-13,Explainer: An eye for an eye? China's new anti-foreign sanctions law.,"by yew lun tianbeijing (reuters) china passed a wide-ranging law to counter foreign sanctions on thursday, in an apparent move to legalise its tit-for-tat retaliation against punitive actions taken by foreign countries over issues from human rights to hong kong. the law, effective immediately, builds upon previous administrative counter-measures against foreign sanctions issued by the chinese foreign and commerce ministries.  it also lays out the scope of china's counter-sanctions. who's the target?individuals or entities involved in the making or implementation of discriminatory measures against chinese citizens, or interfering with china's internal affairs could be put onto a blacklist, according to the full text of the law published on thursday. blacklisted individuals could find their relatives, and the organisations of which they are senior managers or have control over placed on the list. ""relevant departments"" in the chinese government can decide who to put on or remove from the blacklist. what happens to those blacklisted?those blacklisted could be denied entry into china or deported from china.  their assets within china can be sealed, seized or frozen. entities within china could be restricted from engaging in all forms of transactions or cooperation or other activities, potentially limiting the investment activities of blacklisted entities in china. chinese citizens or organisations can sue in chinese courts those who enforce foreign measures that discriminate against them. how is this different from the past?while the foreign ministry has previously announced sanctions mainly against individuals including western politicians and scholars, it had not cited a specific law as the legal basis. it was also not always clear what those sanctions entailed. although the commerce ministry has announced mechanisms targeted at foreign entities such as a so-called ""unreliable entity list"", there have been no known instances of companies being put on the list. the new law combines many features of these administrative orders by the foreign and commerce ministries, such as allowing chinese companies to sue for compensation and denying entry to blacklisted persons. beijing analysts say the new law makes china's sanctions appear less random, as it spells out who can be blacklisted and what the sanctions would entail. what do supporters say?state media and experts in china said the new law was a long overdue ""legal weapon"" needed to deter the west from interfering in china's internal affairs. all 14 vice-chairpersons of china's legislature who passed the law have been under u. s.  sanctions for passing the national security law last year that critics say has crippled political freedoms in hong kong. in other measures, the united states issued a ban on cotton and tomato imports from china's western xinjiang region in january, citing human rights violations and the use of forced labour in the region. wang jiangyu, a law professor at city university of hong kong, said the european union has a law the ""blocking statute"" to counter u. s.  sanctions, so china should not be faulted for having a similar law. ""the new law is the stick part of the carrot and stick diplomacy.  but it is defensive in nature, not offensive, and will only be used when other countries apply sanctions on us first,"" said cheng xiaohe, an associate professor of international studies at the renmin university of china. what do critics say?foreign companies increasingly fear they will be used as sacrificial pawns in a game of political chess, said joerg wuttke, president of european union chamber of commerce. chinese experts say the law could dampen the climate for foreign investment, but that the chinese government would have calculated this is a price worth paying to safeguard the country's interests.

""b3w will collectively catalyse hundreds of billions of dollars of infrastructure investment for low-and middle-income countries in the coming years,"" it said. funding will emphasise the environment and climate, labour safeguards, transparency and anti-corruption, it added, in implicit contrast with china's opaque funding.  further details would come in the g-7 summit's final communique today, the white house added. the rival plan comes after the us and china clashed in rare talks on friday, with mr biden's administration pressing beijing on covid-19, taiwan and human rights. in a telephone call with china's top diplomat yang jiechi, us secretary of state antony blinken renewed us pressure on china over the origins of the pandemic that has killed more than 3. 7 million people. he ""stressed the importance of cooperation and transparency regarding the origin of the virus"", including allowing world health organisation experts back into china, state department spokesman ned price said in a statement. mr biden has ordered us intelligence to report back by late august on whether the sars-cov-2 virus that causes covid-19, which was first detected in late 2019 in the chinese city of wuhan, emerged from an animal source or a laboratory accident. b3w will collectively catalyse hundreds of billions of dollars of infrastructure investment for low-and middle-income countries in the coming years. mr yang told mr blinken that the laboratory theory was ""absurd"", according to the state-run china global television network. ""we urge the us side to respect facts and science, not to politicise the origin tracing and to focus its attention on international cooperation on the fight against the pandemic,"" mr yang said. according to china central television, mr yang told mr blinken: ""genuine multilateralism is not pseudo-multilateralism based on the interests of small circles. ""the leaders of g-7 nations britain, canada, france, germany, italy, japan and the us are largely focused on ""building back better"" after covid-19 wrecked economies and claimed millions of lives around the world. they were set yesterday to outline a joint declaration aimed at preventing another pandemic, as part of their wide-ranging talks on the second day of the summit in britain.  the leaders are also set to issue new commitments on climate change, including financial aid for the developing world. the agenda broadened yesterday to foreign policy issues, as they were joined by the leaders of australia, south africa and south korea, with india taking part remotely. mr biden was expected to seek to address frayed relations with moscow, in particular over its cyber activity. agence france-pressejoin st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

""the #carbisbaydeclaration marks a proud and historic moment for us all,"" british prime minister boris johnson said on twitter, as he chaired the second day of the three-day summit. ""under this agreement, the world's leading democracies will commit to preventing a global pandemic from ever happening again, ensuring the devastation caused by covid-19 is never repeated,"" he said. world health organisation chief tedros adhanom ghebreyesus, criticised in some quarters for being too accommodating towards china where the coronavirus was first detected, welcomed the health pact. he also said the united nations agency would examine a british proposal to create a ""global pandemic radar"" to send early warnings of future outbreaks. ""the world needs a stronger global surveillance system to detect new epidemic and pandemic risks,"" dr tedros said. however, aid charity oxfam said the declaration ""does nothing to address the fundamental problems that are preventing vaccines being accessible to the vast majority of humanity"".

the g-7 – britain, canada, france, germany, italy, japan and the united states – are largely focussed on ""building back better"" after covid-19 wrecked economies and claimed millions of lives around the world. they are expected to pledge to donate one billion vaccine doses to poor countries this year and next – although campaigners say the rollout is much too slow to end the crisis sooner.  the leaders are also set to issue new commitments on climate change, including financial aid for the developing world, in the buildup to the un's cop26 environmental summit in scotland in november.

the agenda broadened on saturday to foreign policy issues, as the g-7 was joined by the leaders of australia, south africa and south korea, with india taking part remotely.  president biden is expected to press allies to bolster cooperation in dealing with a resurgent china, from offering an alternative to its trillion-dollar ""belt and road"" infrastructure initiative to confronting its alleged forced labour practices including against the muslim uighur minority in xinjiang region. ""this is not just about confronting or taking on china,"" a senior white house official said.  ""this is about providing an affirmative, positive alternative vision for the world. ""he said mr biden would be urging ""concrete action"" on the forced labour accusations, calling them ""an affront to human dignity, and an egregious example of china's unfair economic competition"". china denies allegations that it is waging ""genocide"" by forcing uighurs and people from other ethnic-turkic minorities into internment camps in xinjiang. the us president will also seek to address frayed relations with moscow, in particular over its cyber activity.  most of the g-7 leaders will reconvene on monday in brussels for a nato meeting, before mr biden heads on to his first summit with russian president vladimir putin in geneva, vowing to deliver a blunt message about russian behaviour. in a rare interview with us media released on friday, mr putin voiced hope that mr biden would be less impetuous than former us president donald trump, who infamously sided with the russian leader against the views of his own intelligence chiefs. ""it is my great hope that, yes, there are some advantages, some disadvantages, but there will not be any impulse-based movements on behalf of the sitting us president,"" mr putin told nbc news.  closer to home for the g-7 hosts, mr johnson came under concerted pressure in separate meetings with the leaders of france, germany and the european union to respect his brexit commitments over northern ireland.  ""the prime minister expressed confidence in the uk's position in the northern ireland protocol,"" a defiant downing street responded, referring to special brexit arrangements for the restive province.  ""he made clear his desire for pragmatism and compromise on all sides but underlined that protecting the belfast good friday (peace) agreement in all its dimensions was paramount.

2021-06-13,'Very small risk' of heart inflammation after second dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine: Singapore expert committee.,"six cases, four involving men aged between 18 to 30 years old, have been reported in singapore. singapore: there may be a ""very small risk"" of heart inflammation after the second dose of an mrna covid-19 vaccine, said the government-appointed expert committee on covid-19 vaccination in singapore. in a media release on friday (jun 11), the committee said it is closely monitoring international reports that the second dose of mrna covid-19 vaccines may be associated with a small risk of myocarditis and pericarditis in young men. myocarditis and pericarditis are inflammatory conditions that affect the heart muscles and the outer lining of the heart respectively. increased occurrences of myocarditis and pericarditis after the second dose of mrna covid-19 vaccinations have been observed in israel and the united states, and in adolescents and young men younger than 25 years. singapore uses the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines for its national vaccination programme.  both are mrna-based vaccines. in a separate update, the health sciences authority (hsa) said israel, which uses the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine, recently announced that there may be a probable link between the second dose and the onset of myocarditis in men aged between 16 and 30 years old in its population. the link was found stronger among the younger age group of 16 to 19 years old. while no other country has highlighted a similar causal link to date, the us centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) has reported that it has observed more cases of myocarditis and pericarditis in male patients aged between 16 and 24 years old. ""nonetheless, they have stressed that investigations are ongoing, and they have not made any conclusion about a causal link,"" said hsa. most cases are ""mild"", six such reports received by hsamyocarditis and pericarditis occur more often in men compared to women.  symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath or abnormal heartbeats. most cases are mild and patients recover without the need for significant intervention, nor do they suffer from any long-term effects.  the expert committee added that very rarely, severe cases may result in damage to the heart muscles. the two conditions are separate and distinct from heart attacks, which are caused when the blood flow to the heart is blocked. in singapore, hsa said it has received six such reports as of jun 7.  two of the cases involved a man and a woman older than 40 years old.  the other four cases involved men aged between 18 and 30 years old. ""(the four cases) are at the upper end of the expected range for this age group, based on background incidence rates,"" said hsa. most of the cases were reported to have occurred within a few days after receiving the second dose of the vaccine.  all have recovered or have been discharged well from the hospital. although the local numbers are small, the pattern of occurrence after the second covid-19 vaccine and in young men is consistent with what has been observed in the us and israel, which are the two major users of the mrna vaccines, said hsa. those who developed myocarditis and pericarditis responded well to treatment and recovered, added hsa. ""overall, the benefits of the pfizer-biontech and moderna covid-19 vaccines continue to outweigh the known risks of covid-19 disease and its severe complications in a pandemic,"" it added. the authority has also informed the ministry of health (moh) and the expert committee of its assessment. ""we will also continue to monitor this closely and take the relevant and necessary regulatory actions,"" said hsa. the committee said it has reviewed the available international and local data. ""our assessment is that the benefits of receiving the mrna covid-19 vaccines, i. e. , reduction in covid-19 infections and severe complications even if infected, continue to outweigh the risks of vaccination.

""for us, this is a big night and tomorrow will be even a bigger day.  i am almost crying.  we fought peacefully for this (mr netanyahu's departure) and the day has come,"" said protester ofir robinski. a fragile eight-party alliance, ranging from the right-wing jewish nationalist yamina party to arab lawmakers, was early this month cobbled together by centrist politician yair lapid. last friday, all coalition agreements had been signed and submitted to the knesset secretariat, the yamina party announced, a moment that party leader naftali bennett said brought ""to an end two and a half years of political crisis"". but the ever-combative mr netanyahu has tried to peel off defectors that would deprive the nascent coalition of its wafer-thin legislative majority. if the new government is confirmed, mr bennett, a former defence minister, would serve as premier for two years. coalition architect mr lapid, who heads the yesh atid party and is a former television presenter, would then take the helm. the anti-netanyahu bloc spans the political spectrum, including three right-wing, two centrist and two left-wing parties, along with an arab islamic conservative party. the improbable alliance emerged two weeks after an 11-day war between israel and hamas, the islamist group that rules the palestinian enclave of gaza and following inter-communal violence in israeli cities with significant arab populations. ""we will work together, out of partnership and national responsibility and i believe we will succeed,"" mr bennett said last friday. sunday's crucial knesset session is due to open at 4pm local time (9pm singapore time), with mr bennett, mr lapid and mr netanyahu all set to speak before the vote. mr netanyahu has heaped pressure on his former right-wing allies to defect from the fledgling coalition while attacking the legitimacy of the bennett-lapid partnership. he has accused mr bennett of ""fraud"" for siding with rivals and angry rallies by the premier's likud party supporters have resulted in security being bolstered for some lawmakers. mr netanyahu's bombastic remarks as he sees his grip on power slip have drawn parallels at home and abroad to former united states president donald trump, who described his election loss last year as the result of a rigged vote. the prime minister has called the prospective coalition ""the greatest election fraud in the history"" of israel. his likud party said the accusations refer to mr bennett entering a coalition that ""doesn't reflect the will of the voters"". sunday's vote arrives hot on the heels of police crackdowns on palestinian protests over the threatened eviction of families from homes in israeli-annexed east jerusalem to make way for jewish settlers, a month after similar clashes fuelled the latest war between israel and hamas. it also comes amid right-wing anger over the postponement of a controversial jewish nationalist march. mr netanyahu favoured finding a way to allow the so-called ""march of the flags"", originally scheduled to take place last thursday, to proceed as planned. he took that position despite the original route envisaging the march unfolding close to flashpoint areas including the al-aqsa mosque compound, where clashes last month triggered the gaza conflict. the premier's insistence saw his opponents accuse him and his allies of stoking tensions to cling onto power via a ""scorched earth"" campaign. if mr netanyahu loses the premiership, he will not be able to push through changes to basic laws that could give him immunity in regard to his corruption trial. the controversial flag march is now slated for tuesday and ongoing tensions surrounding it could represent a key initial test for any approved coalition. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-13,"Tennis: After toppling Nadal, Djokovic hopes to be ready for Tsitsipas.","paris: after dethroning 'king of clay' rafa nadal at the french open, novak djokovic will next face a first-time grand slam finalist in stefanos tsitsipas as the world number one bids to become the first man in the open era to win all four majors at least twice. roy emerson and rod laver are the only men to have won each of the four grand slams on two or more occasions but no one has achieved the feat since 1968, when the sport allowed professional players to compete at the majors. a second trophy at roland garros, after his 2016 triumph on the red clay, on sunday will also give the 34-year-old serbian his 19th grand slam title one short of nadal and roger federer's men's record. his challenger will be a 22-year-old who is bidding to become the first greek to win a singles major. tsitsipas has long been marked out as a future grand slam champion and has already collected trophies from the season-ending atp finals and a masters 1000 tournament. but he had drawn a blank the three times he reached the last-four stage at a major before friday's semi-final where he took down u. s.  open finalist alexander zverev in a thrilling five-set duel. the first grand slam finalist from greece will arrive on court philippe chatrier on sunday with a 2-5 win-loss record against the serbian but will draw inspiration from the fact that he has a tour-leading win tally in 2021. ""i'm looking forward to that challenge,"" tsitsipas said on friday, looking ahead to his first major final. ""i'm looking forward to bring my game to kind of challenge myself to step it up. ""nothing less than his 'a' game would suffice for the greek as he has never managed to defeat djokovic on clay though he took the serbian to five sets in the semi-finals at the same venue last year. the emotions of friday's fantastic win over 13-time french open winner nadal might leave a hangover for most players but that might not be a problem for djokovic with his incredible mental strength. ""it's not the first time that i play an epic semi-final in a grand slam and then i have to come back in less than 48 hours and play finals,"" he said. ""my recovery abilities are pretty good, i must say, throughout my career . . .  i know what i need to do. ""djokovic was happy to relax a bit and enjoy his semi-final win over his great rival but will not take anything for granted against the greek. ""he's in great form,"" the serbian said.  ""i think he matured as a player a lot.  clay (is) arguably his best surface. ""we played an epic five-setter last year in the semis here.  yeah, i know it's going to be another tough one.

""where available, use a vehicle maintenance pit or purpose-built vehicle ramp or lift to safely access the bottom of a vehicle,"" the council stated. sunday's incident is the second workplace fatality for smrt in two years.  in march last year, a technical officer died while working at the bishan depot.  mr muhammad afiq senawi, 30, was operating a hydraulic press machine when a 5kg rod flew out, broke through fencing and hit him in the face. these incidents followed other serious worksite mishaps at smrt. in 2016, two trainees aged 24 and 26 were killed on a track near pasir ris mrt station. in 2018, a 59-year-old worker had his right foot amputated after it was crushed by a maintenance train. the 2016 tragedy was found to have been caused by a failure to impose safety protocols while the cause of the other incident has not yet been made known. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-13,Commentary: Southeast Asian countries should not be rattled by China despite economic realities.,"an incursion by chinese aircraft into malaysian airspace is yet another reminder of beijing's belligerence, says this observernew south wales: earlier this month, 16 chinese military transport aircraft weresighted a little more than 100kmoff the coast of the east malaysian state of sarawak. the royal malaysian air force called it ""a serious threat to national sovereignty"". the ministry of foreign affairs summoned china's ambassador to malaysia to voice its displeasure over the incursion into malaysian airspace.  however, china's foreign ministry spokesperson dismissed malaysian concerns by claiming that the aircraft were there for ""routine flight exercises"". malaysia is not alone in being wary of chinese intentions in the region.  china's infamous ""nine-dash line"" around the south china sea and unilateral claims to as much as 80 per cent of the disputed waters, along with the construction of artificial islands, has caused much consternation. regular incursions by chinese fishing trawlers have occurred in indonesian, vietnamese and filipino waters, and the belligerence displayed by chinese naval vessels and aircraft has further fuelled suspicions. southeast asian leaders must balance economic realities with defending territorial sovereignty and national pride. the incursion by chinese aircraft into malaysian airspace comes barely two months after a controversial remark by the malaysian foreign affairs minister hishammuddin hussein during a visit to fujian province in southern china on apr 1. hishammuddin told his chinese counterpart wang yi that ""you will always be my elder brother"".  prominent malaysian opposition leader anwar ibrahim lamented that ""this is not the language and style that should be used in the diplomatic world and international relations, as it seemingly implies malaysia is a puppet to a foreign power"". anwar urged hishammuddin to retract his comment and apologise to malaysians.  hishammuddin later clarified that his remark was meant to show his respect to wang, who is an older person and a very senior diplomat. china as a superpowerhishammudin should have been more cautious with his language.  his remarks offer a further warning of the potential cost to southeast asian leaders of being seen to defer to china's sphere of influence. beijing has calculated that as china gained stature as a superpower southeast asian nations would not, and could not, challenge its economic and military might.  this was underscored after president xi jinping announced in 2015 that china had no intention of militarising the south china sea, only to then proceeded to build more artificial islands and install missiles and erect buildings and military bases on those islands. the risk for hishammudin was to again reinforce this lesson. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid. southeast asian countries, including malaysia, recognise that none of them has the capability to match china's military might.  and the region does indeed have deep ties with china economically, which beijing is eager to grow. construction of a high-speed railway service linking kunming in yunnan province with singapore as part of the belt and road initiative (bri) remains a top priority for china.  however, southeast asian leaders must balance economic realities with defending territorial sovereignty and national pride. china has been actively cultivating malaysia through the funding and construction of massive infrastructure projects.  in 2016, the east coast rail link (ecrl) costing 65. 5 billion ringgit (us$15. 8 billion) was launched to link kuantan on the eastern coast with ports in the western coast. the melaka gateway, a us$10. 5 billion commercial and property development project, was awarded to a malaysian company that included three chinese commercial partners.  three pipelines were also awarded to chinese companies at a cost of us$4. 1 billion. tight economic tiesmalaysia was right to be disappointed at china's action to send military planes close to its borders. yet after the ruling barisan nasional was voted out of office in 2018, the incoming prime minister mahathir mohamed proceeded to review these projects.  in a visit to beijing in august 2018, he warned about the ""new version of colonialism"" where rich countries preyed on poorer ones in what was taken to be a swipe to china. the three planned pipelines were scrapped a month later.  mahathir renegotiated terms for the ecrl and reduced the cost to 44 billion ringgit in 2019. with the collapse of the mahathir government in february 2020, prime minister muhyiddin yassin proceeded to mend ties with china.  in april this year, it was announced that the renegotiated ecrl would cost 50 billion ringgit. however, the malacca state government cancelled the melaka gateway project in november 2020 on the basis that there had been ""no development"". malaysia's experience in an example of how china influence is conditioning behaviour in southeast asia.  in 2019, nikkei asia reported that the 10-member association of southeast asian nations had overtaken the united states as the second-largest trading partner for china. chinese investments also flow into southeast asia, largely through the bri, the global times reporting in november 2020 that china's investment in southeast asia was more than 76 per cent of the total investment in countries and regions linked with the bri. but none of this should be cause for southeast asian leaders to surrender sovereign interests to a bully in beijing.  malaysia was right to be disappointed at china's action to send military planes close to its borders. malaysia should take a lesson of its own, that china has a ""new version of colonialism"".  responding collectively as a region should be the priority. jason lim is senior lecturer in asian history at the university of wollongong and the international history review editor of the asian studies review.  this commentaryfirst appearedin the lowy institute's blog the interpreter.

2021-06-13,IN FOCUS: How Johor’s residential property market has been hit hard by COVID-19.,"the johor skyline is now dotted with empty condominium units, due to an oversupply in the market and lack of foreign buyers. johor bahru: when singapore business owner jonathan gan purchased a four-room condominium at lovell country garden in 2018, he thought he had clinched his dream retirement home. the freehold apartment located near johor bahru's city centre was twice the size of his three-room hdb flat in singapore, but the cost was only half of the latter when he bought it directly from the developers. ""the best thing about the unit is the amazing view.  you never get anything close to it at such value in singapore,"" added the 42-year-old, who lives with his wife and two daughters. the apartment, like most units in the lovell development, overlooks the straits of johor.  the balcony opens up to a picturesque sea view and there is a sandy beach below. ""it was the ideal weekend home,"" said gan.  ""but now it's becoming a bugbear. ""just three years after he purchased it, gan, who bought the unit at around rm1 million (us$242,000), is having a hard time trying to sell it, even though the asking price is a fraction of what he paid for it. since the covid-19 pandemic hit last year, border closures between singapore and malaysia meant that he and his family could not visit his weekend home. furthermore, gan's business in singapore has been affected by the pandemic, and he now needs to sell the apartment to gain some liquidity. ""all this was never part of the plan.  but the house is just left there, collecting dust and its value is going down by the day.  we felt it is better to cut our losses and try to get rid of it,"" he told cna. despite being on the market for over a year, there have been no takers.  he has engaged agents and even advertised the unit on various property portals but to no avail. ""there is not much hope.  barely anyone has viewed or signalled interest,"" he said. gan is among property owners in johor bahru who are having issues trying to sell their properties, as the market is in the doldrums due to the prolonged effects of covid-19. condominium developments around johor bahru were built with foreign buyers in mind, but the pandemic has closed borders, leaving many of them empty.  units owned by those from china, singapore, hong kong have been left unoccupiedwhile homes that were left unsold have stayed empty.  landed property is also facing potential depreciation. johor's oversupply problemaccording to statistics compiled by property consultancy firm henry butcher, the value and volume of residential property transactions in johor had been climbing ""rather steadily"" from 2017 until 2019. in its report on the outlook of the malaysian property market in 2021, the firm noted that the volume of transactions rose 8 per cent in 2018 and 7. 5 per cent in 2019, while the value of the transactions increased by 1. 5 per cent in 2018 and 15. 9 per cent in 2019. the report highlighted that the movement control order (mco) imposed by the malaysian government from mar 18, 2020, was a key reason that reversed the upward trend. it said that in the first nine months of 2020, the volume and value of transactions declined by almost a quarter compared to the same period in 2019. property analyst debbie choy, who is director of knight frank malaysia's johor branch, said the situation is particularly bad for condominiums and serviced apartments, of which there is an oversupply in the iskandar region. ""many developments were targeting a large proportion of overseas buyers.  with the prolonged effects of covid-19 restricting movements, it has been challenging for developers or investors to offload either for sale or rent,"" said choy. the situation is exacerbated by the fact that foreigners are presently not allowed to purchase homes in malaysia under the malaysia my second home program (mm2h) scheme, which has been temporarily suspended since july 2020. mm2h was suspended by the ministry of tourism, arts and culture (motac) in line with the government's decision to bar foreigners from entering enter malaysia following the outbreak of covid-19. motac added that the government is currently reviewing the mm2h programme, and that foreigners still interested to participate must abide by the latest requirements when it is reinstated. mm2h president anthony liew was quoted by local media last sunday (jun 6) saying that the suspension has curtailed interest from singapore and china buyers in johor property. ""the three big chinese developers, country garden pacificview, r&f development and greenland group, have seen the demand for their developments in johor from chinese buyers drop,"" loke reportedly said. even owners of the more premium, newer developments in johor bahru are having problems trying to attract tenants. a taiwanese woman, who wanted to be known only as k, told cna that she has put up her 3-room condominium unit at the astaka for rent, after she headed back home when the pandemic hit. the astaka, a premium condominium located at bukit senyum in the heart of johor bahru, saw 70 per cent of its units snapped up by buyers when it was first launched in 2019. the two towers, standing at 65 and 70 storeys, have three- or four-room units of between 2,207 and 2,659 sq ft. however, after the pandemic hit, demand has dried up and owners who are not in johor are not able to find interested tenants. k told cna that she had purchased the unit in 2019, with the idea of renting it out for investment returns.  however, after almost two years, no tenant has made a ""suitable offer"". she first listed her 3-room unit at rm5,700 a month.  fifteen months later, she has lowered the rental price to rm3,800 and there has not been a single offer from potential tenants.  she purchased the unit for around rm2 million. ""i think considering the circumstances, i have no choice but to lower the rental price.  i notice that there have been no offers.  i am patient.  hopefully, when the pandemic is over, there will be people who are interested,"" said k. the demand from johoreans has also weakened, as they reel from the effects of the pandemic. khor yu leng, a political economist with consultancy firm segi enam advisors, said that besides border closures restricting foreign buyers or tenants, locals are also grappling with the economic impact of covid-19 and their disposable income has been restricted. she noted that locals with more spending power were typically johoreans who commuted daily to singapore for work.  however, with borders closed from daily commuting, this group is either out of work or is now based in singapore. ""the spending power of the former johor daily commuters and singapore residents who visited johor weekly or otherwise has diminished or disappeared from the johor economy,"" said khor. she noted that the impact on the johor economy meant that some johoreans have turned to the state government for financial assistance,and buying luxury condominium property is not realistic. ""a year later, with johor's economic umbilical still cut off from singapore, and malaysia suffering a big wave of covid-19, informal social support activities (to help the lower-income households) have been ongoing,"" added khor. even with the overall value and volume of transactions increasing prior to covid-19, khor noted there were signs that some condominium developments were struggling to sell their excess units. in its report, henry butcher malaysia highlighted that johor was the state with the highest proportion of unsold residential properties in the country, even before covid-19. the report said that johor contributes 19. 5 per cent of ""overhang"" residential properties and a whopping 73. 7 per cent of all overhang condominium apartments in the country in 2019. ""of these, approximately 34 per cent of the overhang service apartments/sohos are priced over rm1 million which were believed to have been designed specifically for foreign investors from singapore and china,"" the report said. landed homes also affectedbesides condominiums and serviced apartments, those with landed properties in the southern state are also concerned about depreciating values. a singaporean who wanted to be known only as mustaqim, who owns a two-storey 4,000 sq ft terrace home at gated community horizon hills, has expressed concern that the value of his house is depreciating since he purchased it in july 2017. horizon hills is popular among foreign buyers, especially singaporeans, as it is a mere 15-minute drive to tuas second link.  the development is also close to amenities such as the sunway iskandar township, which has hospitals, malls as well as prestigious international schools. mustaqim bought the house as a retirement home rather than an investment, but admitted he was worried that based onrecent price trendsin the area, his home has lost some of its value. he bought his home a decade after the development was launched in 2017, for around rm1. 8 million. ""with covid-19, some of my neighbours who are singaporeans have decided to sell their homes for rm1. 1 million to rm1. 2 million.  it is spoiling the market a bit but i can understand why with the borders closed,"" said mustaqim. ""i am concerned that this downward trend will continue and my home's value will be going lower and lower.  i would be owning a depreciating asset,"" he added. however, mustaqim, who is currently in singapore due to the borders being closed, is determined to wait out the pandemic. ""the value will rise again post-pandemic,"" said mustaqim. property agents in johor have also seen their livelihoods hit with the lower volume and value of transactions during covid-19. an agent who wanted to be quoted only as brian, told cna that he has been forced to take a second mortgage on his own home as the number of transactions has dried up since the pandemic. ""some months i barely make any transactions, so i've been looking around for another job to tide through over the next few months,"" he said. the agent, who specialises in selling condominiums in the central johor bahru area, said that most developments have the same problem – too many units on sale with ""almost zero"" demand. ""some months, we have to live with zero completed transactions.  so, the situation is really bad for us,"" added brian. the tightening of restrictions during the ongoing nationwide mco 3. 0 meant that agents are not able to legally arrange physical viewings of homes for any interested buyers or tenants.  with virtual viewings being the only permissible option, it becomes even harder to make a sale. cna has approached the johor chief minister's office, as well as the state housing and local government committee for comments on the state of the property market and whether measures will be taken to assist industry players. empty homes susceptible to crimeanother headache for owners whose properties have been left empty is their susceptibility to break-ins. economist khor said that properties that are not located within gated communities may be more vulnerable. investors with properties in johor but cannot be physically there are now confronting the practical problems of how to guard, maintain and have a house-sitter, she said. ""the reality of the prolonged border closure will surely crimp some future demand,"" she added. in september last year, it was reported that police had arrested two men for breaking into houses at taman bukit indah, a suburb where foreigners have been known to invest in property. johor police added that the pair had specifically targeted vacant homes whose owners were in singapore due to the border restrictions. rahmah zainolabidin, a singaporean who chose to remain in johor bahru during this pandemic, told cna that she has been taking care of homes belonging to her family members who have chosen to return to the city-state. she told cna how her sister's home, a terrace house located in a non-gated community in taman bukit indah, had been robbed in august 2020. ""when i was walking towards the home from afar, i could see that something was wrong.  the windows were pried open wide and the gate was ajar,"" said the 65-year-old. ""they broke the gate grilles and drilled into the safe, taking thousands of dollars in cash as well as jewellery,"" she added. rahmah said that her sister was considering selling the house, but she had to first set aside money to repair the damage inflicted. ""it is sad because she already got robbed, but now she has to fork out more money to try to sell it off.  and in this market, i'm convinced there will be little interest, especially with the number of robberies reported in the area,"" rahmah added. ""crime is a serious issue . . .  i don't think people would consider buying homes in areas with high incidences of break-ins. ""charmaine tay, a freelance agent who focuses on property deals in johor bahru and the medini iskandar malaysia area, told cna that houses located in areas with a high incidence of break-ins have seen a drop in value and demand. ""many buyers are aware that landed homes are susceptible to break-ins in johor, so they tend to look for those located within gated areas where there are security checks,"" said tay. ""but for those houses outside gated communities, especially in areas like taman bukit indah where robbery is common, they are harder to sell, and the value has depreciated faster recently,"" she addedbuyers from other states, overseas bargain hunters could spark recoverythose interviewed by cna said that there are two groups of buyers who could help pave the way towards recovery in the residential property sector. the first group is potential buyers from other states. choy of knight frank predicted that domestic tourism will likely recover first.  she noted how in the second half of 2020, the property market saw a slight rebound when movement restrictions were lifted domestically before another wave of infections hit in september. choy said that many malaysians who have been stuck in kuala lumpur would then take some ""leisure time off"" and possibly buy or rent properties in the smaller cities. however, she warned that the high-rise residential sector in johor would only see gradual and slow progress as the units, which are in abundant oversupply, are not priced right for locals. ""developers have since then restructured and re-looked at planning to target more local purchasers i. e.  by reducing unit sizing and thus, the end pricing – this makes the prices more palatable for the local community,"" said choy. the return of foreign buyers may also provide some relief. choy highlighted the reopening of borders will provide ""a more optimistic outlook with more certainty and flexibility on travel arrangements"", especially with the currently low prices. she noted that even as there will be bargain hunters from overseas, foreign buyers should note the johor land administration has stated that there is a minimum threshold of rm1 million on residential homes for non-malaysian citizens. with borders remaining shut in the short term, the situation seems especially bleak for those desperate to sell their homes like gan, who cannot find a buyer despite lowering his asking price for his four-room apartment at lovell country garden. ""it's a sticky situation.  although we had good times using it as a weekend home, ultimately buying it was a wrong decision we now regret,"" he said. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

view.', 'you never get anything close to it at such value in singapore,"" added the 42-year-old, who lives with his wife and two daughters.', 'the apartment, like most units in the lovell development, overlooks the straits of johor.', 'the balcony opens up to a picturesque sea view and there is a sandy beach below.', '""it was the ideal weekend home,"" said gan.', '""but now it\'s becoming a bugbear.', '""just three years after he purchased it, gan, who bought the unit at around rm1 million (us$242,000), is having a hard time trying to sell it, even though the asking price is a fraction of what he paid for it.', 'since the covid-19 pandemic hit last year, border closures between singapore and malaysia meant that he and his family could not visit his weekend home.', ""furthermore, gan's business in singapore has been affected by the pandemic, and he now needs to sell the apartment to gain some liquidity."", '""all this was never part of the plan.', 'but the house is just left

'condominium developments around johor bahru were built with foreign buyers in mind, but the pandemic has closed borders, leaving many of them empty.', 'units owned by those from china, singapore, hong kong have been left unoccupiedwhile homes that were left unsold have stayed empty.', 'landed property is also facing potential depreciation.', 'johor\'s oversupply problemaccording to statistics compiled by property consultancy firm henry butcher, the value and volume of residential property transactions in johor had been climbing ""rather steadily"" from 2017 until 2019. in its report on the outlook of the malaysian property market in 2021, the firm noted that the volume of transactions rose 8 per cent in 2018 and 7.', '5 per cent in 2019, while the value of the transactions increased by 1.', '5 per cent in 2018 and 15.', '9 per cent in 2019. the report highlighted that the movement control order (mco) imposed by the malaysian government from mar 18, 2020, was a key reason that reversed the upward trend.', ""it said that in the first nine months of 2020, the volume and value of transactions declined by almost a quarter compared to the same period in 2019. property analyst debbie choy, who is director of knight frank malaysia's johor branch, said the situation is particularly bad for condominiums and serviced apartments, of which there is an oversupply in the iskandar region."", '""many developments were targeting a large proportion of overseas buyers.', 'with the prolonged effects of covid-19 restricting movements, it has been challenging for developers or investors to offload either for sale or rent,"" said choy.', ""the situation is exacerbated by the fact that foreigners are presently not allowed to purchase homes in malaysia under the malaysia my second home program (mm2h) scheme, which has been temporarily suspended since july 2020. mm2h was suspended by the ministry of tourism, arts and culture (motac) in line with the government's decision

premium condominium located at bukit senyum in the heart of johor bahru, saw 70 per cent of its units snapped up by buyers when it was first launched in 2019. the two towers, standing at 65 and 70 storeys, have three- or four-room units of between 2,207 and 2,659 sq ft. however, after the pandemic hit, demand has dried up and owners who are not in johor are not able to find interested tenants.', 'k told cna that she had purchased the unit in 2019, with the idea of renting it out for investment returns.', 'however, after almost two years, no tenant has made a ""suitable offer"".', 'she first listed her 3-room unit at rm5,700 a month.', 'fifteen months later, she has lowered the rental price to rm3,800 and there has not been a single offer from potential tenants.', 'she

political economist with consultancy firm segi enam advisors, said that besides border closures restricting foreign buyers or tenants, locals are also grappling with the economic impact of covid-19

from daily commuting, this group is either out of work or is now based in singapore.', '""the spending power of the former johor daily commuters and singapore residents who visited johor weekly or otherwise has diminished or disappeared from the johor economy,"" said khor.', 'she noted that the impact on the johor economy meant that some johoreans have turned to the state government for financial assistance,and buying luxury condominium property is not realistic.', '""a year later, with johor\'s economic umbilical still cut off from singapore, and malaysia suffering a big wave of covid-19, informal social support activities (to help the lower-income households) have been ongoing,"" added khor.', 'even with the overall value and volume of transactions increasing prior to covid-19, khor noted there were signs that some condominium developments were struggling to sell their excess units.', 'in its report, henry butcher malaysia highlighted that johor was the state with

their homes for rm1.', '1 million to rm1.', '2 million.', 'it is spoiling the market a bit but i can understand why with the borders closed,"" said mustaqim.', '""i am concerned that this downward trend will continue and my home\'s value will be going lower and lower.', 'i would be owning a depreciating asset,"" he added.', 'however, mustaqim, who is currently in singapore due to the borders being closed, is determined to wait out the pandemic.', '""the value will rise again post-pandemic,"" said mustaqim.', 'property agents in johor have also seen their livelihoods hit with the lower volume and value of transactions during covid-19.', 'an agent who wanted to be quoted only as brian, told cna that he has been forced to take a second mortgage on his own home as the number of

agent, who specialises in selling condominiums in the central johor bahru area, said that most developments have the same problem – too many units on sale with ""almost zero"" demand.', '""some months, we have to live with zero completed transactions.', 'so, the situation is really bad for us,"" added brian.', 'the tightening of restrictions during the ongoing nationwide mco 3.', '0 meant that agents are not able to legally arrange physical viewings of homes for any interested buyers or tenants.', 'with virtual viewings being the only permissible option, it becomes even harder to make

be taken to assist industry players."", 'empty homes susceptible to crimeanother headache for owners whose properties have been left empty is their susceptibility to break-ins.', 'economist khor said that properties that are not located within gated communities may be more vulnerable.', 'investors with properties in johor but cannot be physically there are now confronting the practical problems of how to guard, maintain and have a house-sitter, she said.', '""the reality of the prolonged border closure will surely crimp some future demand,"" she added.', 'in september last year, it was reported that police had arrested two men for breaking into houses at taman bukit indah, a suburb where foreigners have been known to invest in property.', 'johor police added that the pair had specifically

considering selling the house, but she had to first set aside money to repair the damage inflicted.', '""it is sad because she already got robbed, but now she has to fork out more money to try to sell

break-ins in johor, so they tend to look for those located within gated areas where there are security checks,"" said tay.', '""but for those houses outside gated communities, especially in areas like taman bukit indah where robbery is common, they are harder to sell, and the value has depreciated faster recently,"" she addedbuyers from other states, overseas bargain hunters could spark recoverythose interviewed by cna said that there are two groups of buyers who could help pave the way towards recovery in the residential property sector.', 'the first group is potential buyers from other states.', 'choy of knight frank predicted that domestic tourism will likely recover first.', 'she noted how in the second half of 2020, the property market saw a slight rebound when movement restrictions were lifted domestically before another wave of infections hit in september.', 'choy said that many malaysians who have been stuck in kuala lumpur would then take some ""leisure time off"" and possibly buy or rent properties in the smaller cities.', 'however, she warned that the high-rise residential sector in johor would only see gradual and slow progress as the units, which are in abundant oversupply, are not priced right for locals.', '""developers have since then restructured and re-looked at planning to target more local purchasers i. e.  by reducing unit sizing and thus, the end pricing – this makes the prices more palatable for the local community,"" said choy.', 'the return of foreign buyers may also provide some relief.', 'choy highlighted the reopening of borders will provide ""a more optimistic outlook with more certainty and flexibility on travel arrangements"", especially with the currently low prices.', 'she noted that even as there will be bargain hunters from overseas, foreign buyers should note the johor land administration has stated that there is a minimum threshold of rm1 million on residential homes for non-malaysian citizens.', 'with borders remaining shut in the short term, the situation seems especially bleak for those desperate to sell their homes like gan, who cannot find a buyer despite lowering his asking price for his four-room apartment at lovell country garden.', '""it\'s a sticky situation.', 'although we had good times using it as a weekend home, ultimately buying it was a wrong decision we now regret,"" he said.',

""enforcement actions will include fines, closures even for first offence, and the revoking of food shop, public entertainment or liquor licences,"" said the ministry. it reminded patrons and operators of f&b establishments to strictly adhere to safe management measures as these places are high-risk settings where coronavirus transmission has taken place in recent weeks. mse also said the national parks board will continue to temporarily close access to some parks and sections of beaches, lawns and facilities such as hardcourts, shelters and carparks when these areas get too crowded or where people remain non-compliant with safe management measures. nparks has advised  compliance with safe management measures on more than 6,000 instances to parkgoers who were not wearing masks, and on more than 800 occasions to people who had gathered in groups of more than two, added the ministry.  these were verbally given by enforcement officers. the latest breach is steamov steamboat buffet restaurant's third offence.  it had allowed customers to dine there at 9. 30pm on may 28. the starz bistro had done so on may 22, and also allowed customers to consume alcohol after 10. 30pm that day. mse said the closure orders for both eateries will take effect when dining in is allowed to resume. it said that agencies have identified places where safe management measures are more frequently breached and have stepped up enforcement presence there. these hot spots includes parks and common areas of housing board estates such as hardcourts, basketball courts and pavilions. ""where repeated breaches of smms have been observed, agencies will close off facilities to ensure the safety of the community,"" added the ministry. for example, a pavilion at block 90 pipit road was cordoned off on may 31 after a group of more than 12 people were found gathering there for dance sessions on multiple occasions.

2021-06-13,"Djokovic conquers 'Everest,' eyes 52-year landmark at French Open.","published :
													13 jun 2021 at 10:45												writer: 
															afp paris novak djokovic can become the first man in 52 years to win all four grand slam titles twice in the french open final on sunday after conquering rafael nadal, the 'mount everest' of roland garros. world number one djokovic takes on greece's stefanos tsitsipas for the title with tennis history on the line. victory for the serb will take him alongside roy emerson and rod laver as the only men to capture the four majors more than once. it's an achievement that has proved even beyond the capabilities of nadal and roger federer. it is so rare an accomplishment that it hasn't happened since 1969 when laver completed his second calendar grand slam. djokovic can pocket a 19th slam with victory and move just one behind the record of 20 jointly held by nadal and federer. djokovic insists there will be no letdown physically or emotionally after reaching the final in paris for a sixth time with an epic triumph over 13-time champion nadal. ""it's not the first time that i play an epic semi-final in a grand slam and then i have to come back in less than 48 hours and play finals,"" said the 34-year-old. ""my recovery abilities have been pretty good throughout my career. ""his four-hour, four-set battle with nadal is already jostling for a prime spot in the list of ""greatest ever matches"" at the slams. 'never believed' -it featured a lung-busting 92-minute third set and required government intervention to allow the 5,000 fans inside court philippe chatrier to watch the match's conclusion despite it extending beyond the 11pm covid-19 curfew. the 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 triumph gave djokovic the honour of being the only man to have beaten nadal in paris more than once, having first achieved it in the 2015 quarter-finals. nadal has only lost three times in 108 matches since his title-winning debut in 2005. djokovic, the 2016 champion, said it was his best win in paris and ranked it among his ""three greatest"" ever performances. ""it's hard to find words bigger than all the superlatives you can think of for rafa's achievements at roland garros,"" said djokovic who now leads their series 30-28 and had lost three finals in the french capital to nadal. ""each time you step on the court with him, you know that you have to kind of climb mount everest to win against this guy here. ""djokovic has already admitted he's a fan of tsitsipas, proclaiming him as a grand slam champion in the making. ""he is a hard worker, dedicated, nice guy,"" said djokovic. ""he's very smart and wise.  i love the fact that he is more than just a tennis player and he's always looking to learn from experience and to understand something new about himself. ""that's the trait of a champion. ""djokovic will be playing in his 29th slam final on sunday. he holds a 5-2 record over tsitsipas, a run which includes all three meetings on clay. at last year's roland garros, djokovic won their semi-final over five sets. ""we played an epic five-setter last year in the semis here.  i know it's going to be another tough one,"" added djokovic who also defeated tsitsipas in rome on the eve of the french open. ""i'm hoping i can recharge my batteries as much as i can because i'm going to need some power and energy for that one. ""tsitsipas, 22, and 12 years younger than the serb, is in his first slam final having ended a run of three semi-final losses by defeating alexander zverev over five sets on friday. victory on sunday would make him the first greek player to win a slam title. he would also become the youngest champion in paris since nadal in 2008 and overall at the slams since juan martin del potro at the 2009 us open. ""i've never believed, have never really thought at what age this achievement might come,"" said tsitsipas.

2021-06-13,China's anti-sanctions law: What we know.,"beijing: a new chinese law against foreign sanctions is designed to boost beijing's power against international pressure, but could spark compliance dilemmas for foreign businesses operating in the world's second-largest economy. it comes just a week after us president joe biden expanded a blacklist of chinese companies in which americans are not allowed to invest. here is what we know about the law so far:what is it?the anti-foreign sanctions law was rushed into force on thursday (jun 10).  it aims to protect chinese individuals or organisations in the event that a country ""uses various pretexts or its laws"" to take ""discriminatory"" action against them. no country is specifically named.  but beijing has accused western nations of ""suppressing"" china's development, especially the united states.  it has lashed out at ""illegal and unreasonable"" sanctions over human rights and flagged an urgent need to fight back. what could it do?countermeasures listed in the law include denying visas, deportation, or seizing assets of those who formulate or comply with sanctions against chinese businesses or officials. it rules that authorities are not only able to target individuals and groups but can also take aim at their family members. the law is broad and ""significantly increases the punitive power of china's anti-sanctions measures"", said university of hong kong associate professor angela zhang. ""the broad scope of this framework means that lots of folks, like scholars, pundits, think tanks, could be sanctioned for supporting sanctions on china,"" warned julian ku, an expert on international law at hofstra university. how could it impact business?senior executives of entities on a countermeasure list could also come under pressure, with potential implications for a large number of people and businesses. ""affected businesses could lose entire access to the chinese market, and chinese citizens and institutions will need to cut ties with affected ngos and think tanks,"" zhang told afp. the law could also create severe compliance issues for multinational companies. part of the legislation prohibits those in china from going along with designated foreign sanctions.  it acts in a similar way to a european blocking statute ""which nullified the effect of us iran sanctions within the eu"", said ku. this puts foreign businesses in a bind if they cannot legally comply with both us sanctions and chinese prohibitions. why now?the law builds on earlier measures which prevent companies and individuals from complying with foreign sanctions targeting china. in an explainer on the national people's congress website, an official said the law was passed in a short period of time because there was ""an urgent need to counter the hegemonism and power politics of certain western countries"". the law will help ""counteract the containment and suppression"" china faces, the official added. beijing has long complained about us sanctions and trade restrictions affecting chinese companies.  but in recent months biden has stepped up us criticism over intellectual property theft and alleged human rights abuses in hong kong and the northwestern xinjiang region. how much of a threat is it?ku warned the law had ""some reasonable parts, and some troubling parts"". the section allowing for retaliatory sanctions ""is unprecedented compared to other countries' sanctions regimes"", he said. foreign companies are regularly caught in the crosshairs of tension between china and western nations, including recent nationalist attacks on fashion brand h&m for voicing concern about forced labour claims in xinjiang. zhang said she believes chinese authorities will not immediately wield the new powers, given that anxiety among foreign businesses could lead to more decoupling. ""if, however, foreign governments continue to press on with aggressive sanctions, then i believe china will start deploying those anti-sanctions laws to demonstrate their coercive power,"" she said. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-13,Malaysian man arrested after spending more than 20 years on the run for smuggling illegal immigrants.,"singapore: a 46-year-old man who had spent more than 20 years on the run for immigration offences he committed has been arrested, said the corrupt practices investigation bureau (cpib) on friday (jun 11). siva kumar ramachandram, who is malaysian, was arrested by the cpib with the help of the malaysian anti-corruption commission (macc) on mar 4 last year. on sep 24, 1999, siva was convicted and sentenced to five years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane for engaging in a conspiracy to smuggle illegal immigrants from singapore into malaysia through woodlands checkpoint. the conspiracy involved bribing a cisco officer to allow buses ferrying the illegal immigrants to pass through the checkpoint without immigration clearance.  the cisco officer was convicted on oct 5, 1999 and was sentenced to 12 months' jail and fined s$2,800 for corruption. siva later absconded from singapore sometime in 1999, while released on bail pending appeal of his conviction and sentence.  an arrest warrant for him was issued on mar 9, 2000, the date of his appeal hearing, which he failed to turn up for. cipb investigations revealed that in october 1999, siva left singapore for malaysia in the vehicle of an unknown individual known as ""boy"". ""boy"" had produced a passport belonging to someone else to the immigration officer at woodlands checkpoint.  this led the immigration officer into believing siva was someone else, thus allowing him to leave singapore, said the authorities. he was arrested on mar 4, 2020 and brought back to singapore.  siva was charged on apr 16 this year with offences punishable under the immigration act and the penal code. on friday, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six months' jail with effect from the expiry of his existing five-year sentence meted out in 1999, said the bureau. ""the invaluable assistance and strong support by the macc has resulted in siva's arrest on mar 4, 2020. ""cpib is grateful for the close collaboration with the macc on this case to ensure that the offender was brought to justice and there was no escaping the long arm of the law,"" it said. the bureau said singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach towards corruption and other criminal activities. ""cpib's mandate is to investigate into any act of corruption in the public and private sectors in singapore, and in the course of doing so, any other offences under any written law,"" it said. anyone who is convicted of knowingly producing any false or misleading document under the immigration act can be sentenced to jail for up to two years and be fined up to s$6,000. anyone who is convicted of failing to appear before a court of justice under the penal code can be sentenced to jail for up to six months and be fined up to s$5,000. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

															reuterscopenhagen: finland's 1-0 win over denmark in their european championship opener on saturday will be remembered for several reasons, coach markku kanerva said after their historic result was overshadowed by denmark's christian eriksen terrifying health scare. playing in their first ever major international tournament, finland claimed a shock 1-0 win after striker joel pohjanpalo headed home the winner on the hour, while keeper lucas hradecky saved a penalty in the 73rd minute. finland had only that one attempt on goal, compared with denmark's 22 shots on goal at the parken stadium. ""it was a very emotional night for us,"" kanerva said.  ""first time in a major tournament and an opening game against denmark in their home stadium.  when we heard the national anthems, it was very emotional for us. ""and then what happened with christian eriksen a very dramatic and sad incident. ""and then finally, we get a good result from the game.  of course i am happy for that.  unbelievable, we are going to remember this for a long time for different reasons. ""eriksen required cpr and emergency medical treatment after collapsing on the pitch, leading to the match being suspended for an hour and 45 minutes before it was restarted. the 29-year-old was rushed to hospital where his condition was stabilised. the danes were clearly affected by the trauma of eriksen's collapse, with some wiping away tears before the restart.  finland's pohjanpalo also refused to celebrate after scoring the winner. ""i said to them that i understood the emotions of the game and how they would feel after what had happened to christian,"" kanerva added. ""i said to them, 'try to focus as much as you can on the game'.  i said 'i know it will be difficult to do that', but they coped really well.

2021-06-13,S$15 million support to help Changi Airport workers adjust to enhanced COVID-19 safety measures.,"jewel changi airport reopens to the public on jun 14, but passenger terminals remain closed to allow the airport community to adapt to new zoning measures and safety protocols. singapore: the civil aviation authority of singapore (caas) and the changi airport group (cag) will set aside s$15 million to help airport workers adjust to enhanced safety measures put in place after more than 100 covid-19 cases were linked to the airport last month. about 5,000 workers will benefit from the s$15 million, which will be used to provide a monthly special allowance and cater meals for workers for six months, as well as defray the cost of personal protective equipment, they said. last month changi airport became singapore's largest active covid-19 cluster, with more than 100 cases, with caas and cag saying at the time that preliminary investigations suggested that theinitial transmissioncould have occurred through an airport worker who was ""assisting a family from south asia"". subsequently changi airport's passenger terminals, as well as entertainment and retail complex jewel, were closed to the public, while additional covid-19 testing was introduced for arrivals from 'very high-risk' countries and regions. in a media release on friday (jun 11), caas and cag said there have not been any new covid-19 positive cases involving airport workers since may 20. ""of the 43 airport workers who had tested positive, 42 have been discharged and the remaining worker is recovering in a hospital general ward without oxygen supplementation,"" they said. they added that they have been working closely with the health ministry and the airport community to ""review and strengthen changi airport's defences against the more transmissible covid-19 variants"". enhanced safety measures have been implemented to protect airport workers, travellers and the public, they said. ""cohorting arrangements for airport workers have been tightened through a zonal system to reduce the risk of cross infection,"" they said. ""in particular, airport workers in the passenger terminal piers, arrival immigration halls and baggage claim halls who have interactions with arriving and transfer passengers and therefore are at higher risk of exposure to the virus, are now required to remain in their work zone throughout their shift, including during their meal and rest times,"" they said. these workers are also required to be in ""higher levels"" of ppe throughout the duration of their shifts, except for meal and rest times. deep cleaning and disinfection of changi airport's passenger terminal buildings and jewel changi airport have been completed, while anenhanced segregated zoning systemannounced last month has been implemented, said caas and cag. ""airport workers have been briefed and trained on the new measures and requirements, to allow the new measures and safety protocols to be implemented smoothly,"" they said, noting there would also be regular reminders, checks and audits on health safety as an ""added safeguard"". ""the safety of our airport workers remains our top priority.  we are therefore supportive of the tightened measures to ensure they are protected in the course of their work,"" said national trades union congress deputy secretary-general cham hui fong. ""our unions will continue to work closely with the relevant stakeholders to mitigate any impact on them, and to ensure their wellbeing is taken care of,"" she added. jewel to reopen on jun 14jewel, which has been closed to the public since may 13, will reopen on jun 14. changi airport's passenger terminals will remain closed to the public to allow the airport community to adapt to the new zoning measures, which require ""significant operational adjustments"", said caas and cag. more details on the reopening of the passenger terminals will be released at a later date, they said. since may 23, airport workers in higher risk roles have had to take an additional antigen rapid test (art) between their seven-day polymerase chain reaction-based rostered routine tests. cag and caas said that since jun 3, it has been testing the use of the traciex breathalyser, which allows workers to blow into a disposable breathalyser fitted with a proprietary sensor chip instead of undergoing an art. traciex was given provisional authorisation by the health sciences authority on may 27. ""the breathalyser will then be inserted into a portable reading device for vibrational spectroscopy analysis, which will be able to tell if a person is infected with covid-19 within two minutes,"" said cag and caas. this will allow workers to receive their results faster than with the current art, they said, adding that workers would also experience less discomfort as the test is non-invasive. ""we aim to progressively replace the art for more airport workers with the traciex breathalyser in the coming months.  this will also allow us to step up the frequency of testing so that we can more quickly detect, isolate and treat any potential covid-19 cases in the airport community,"" they said. transport minister s iswaran, who visited changi airport on friday, described the new breathalyser test as a ""potential game changer"" due to its method of administration. ""we will gradually be scaling up the use of this breathalyser to validate its efficacy, and to be able to then scale up its use for a much wider range of workers,"" he said, noting workers had told him the new test was a welcome alternative to the more invasive pcr and art tests. reopening travelwhen asked about comments made by south korean authorities that the country planned to expedite travel bubble plans with singapore, mr iswaran said singapore was ""engaging in dialogue with many potential partners"". to allow for cross-border travel, key elements such as mutual recognition of vaccinations and testing protocols need to be in place, he said. meanwhile the enhanced safety measures allow the airport to adapt more quickly to emerging risks, he said, describing these measures as an important part of singapore's ""overall posture towards a calibrated and safe reopening of travel"". ""once we have those elements in place then, at the appropriate time, when the ambient conditions are there, we can then activate that plan and mobilise the airlines and other partners to facilitate the kind of cross-border travel that we want to achieve.

2021-06-13,Israel Parliament Set To Vote On Anti Benjamin Netanyahu Government.,"benjamin netanyahu has pushed israeli politics firmly to the right over the years (file)israeli lawmakers are to vote sunday on a ""change"" coalition government of bitter ideological rivals united by their determination to banish prime minister benjamin netanyahu from power. the crunch knesset vote will either terminate the hawkish premier's uninterrupted 12-year tenure or return israel to a stalemate likely to trigger a fifth general election since 2019. netanyahu, who is battling a clutch of corruption charges in an ongoing trial he dismisses as a conspiracy, has pushed israeli politics firmly to the right over the years. on saturday night, around 2,000 protesters rallied outside the 71-year-old's official residence to celebrate what they believe will be his departure from office. ""for us, this is a big night and tomorrow will be even a bigger day.  i am almost crying.  we fought peacefully for this (netanyahu's departure) and the day has come,"" said protester ofir robinski. a fragile eight-party alliance, ranging from the right-wing jewish nationalist yamina party to arab lawmakers, was early this month cobbled together by centrist politician yair lapid. on friday, all coalition agreements had been signed and submitted to the knesset secretariat, yamina announced, a moment party leader naftali bennett said brought ""to an end two and a half years of political crisis"". but the ever-combative netanyahu has tried to peel off defectors that would deprive the nascent coalition of its wafer thin legislative majority. 'peaceful transition'if the new government is confirmed, bennett, a former defence minister, would serve as premier for two years. coalition architect lapid, who heads the yesh atid party and is a former television presenter, would then take the helm. the anti-netanyahu bloc spans the political spectrum, including three right-wing, two centrist and two left-wing parties, along with an arab islamic conservative party. the improbable alliance emerged two weeks after an 11-day war between israel and hamas, the islamist group that rules the palestinian enclave of gaza and following inter-communal violence in israeli cities with significant arab populations. ""we will work together, out of partnership and national responsibility -- and i believe we will succeed,"" bennett said friday. sunday's crucial knesset session is due to open at 4:00 pm local time (1300 gmt), with bennett, lapid and netanyahu all set to speak before the vote. netanyahu has heaped pressure on his former right-wing allies to defect from the fledgling coalition while attacking the legitimacy of the bennett-lapid partnership. he has accused bennett of ""fraud"" for siding with rivals, and angry rallies by the premier's likud party supporters have resulted in security being bolstered for some lawmakers. netanyahu's bombastic remarks as he sees his grip on power slip have drawn parallels at home and abroad to former us president donald trump, who described his election loss last year as the result of a rigged vote. the prime minister has called the prospective coalition ""the greatest election fraud in the history"" of israel. his likud party said the accusations refer to bennett entering a coalition that ""doesn't reflect the will of the voters"". 'scorched earth'sunday's vote arrives hot on the heels of police crackdowns on palestinian protests over the threatened eviction of families from homes in israeli-annexed east jerusalem to make way for jewish settlers, a month after similar clashes fuelled the latest war between israel and hamas. it also comes amid right-wing anger over the postponement of a controversial jewish nationalist march. netanyahu favoured finding a way to allow the so-called ""march of the flags"", originally scheduled to take place last thursday, to proceed as planned. he took that position despite the original route envisaging the march unfolding close to flashpoint areas including the al-aqsa mosque compound, where clashes last month triggered the gaza conflict. the premier's insistence saw his opponents accuse him and his allies of stoking tensions to cling onto power via a ""scorched-earth"" campaign. if netanyahu loses the premiership, he will not be able to push through changes to basic laws that could give him immunity in regard to his corruption trial. the controversial flag march is now slated for tuesday and ongoing tensions surrounding it could represent a key initial test for any approved coalition.

""switzerland and wales, who meet in the group's second game in baku on saturday, always knew italy were the group favourites but the size of their task has suddenly looked somewhat bigger. after a build-up featuring a spine-tingling rendition of nessun dorma by opera singer andrea bocelli – channelling thoughts of italia '90 – a spectacular fireworks display and a typically raucous rendition of italy's national anthem, the 16,000-strong crowd was in fine voice by kick-off. they were given plenty to cheer too as italy made all the early running against a turkish team happy to sit deep and invite pressure.  however, mancini's side were left frustrated in their efforts to break through the wall of red shirts. giorgio chiellini had a header tipped over with a spectacular one-handed save by ugurcan cakir and immobile nodded a cross wide as italy went in at the break with 14 attempts to none from turkey – but without a goal. they kept probing and their patience was rewarded when berardi fired a cross into the six-yard box where demiral chested the ball into the net – the first time in a european championship that the tournament's opening goal was an own goal. the ever-dangerous leonardo spinazzola had a shot beaten away and manuel locatelli's low effort was palmed wide before immobile doubled italy's lead by pouncing on cakir's parry from another spinazzola effort to neatly knock in the rebound. the azzurri's dominance was rewarded again when immobile threaded a pass to insigne, who placed a precise finish into the bottom corner with 11 minutes remaining. it marked the first time italy had scored three goals in a match at the euros at their 39th attempt and capped a perfect start. mancini had told his players they should enjoy themselves and seek to entertain and that was exactly what they did for a jubilant home crowd. there was only gloom in the visiting camp as veteran coach senol gunes, who led turkey to third place at the 2002 world cup, apologised for the performance. ""i was expecting a better game, and i am disappointed and we are sorry,"" he said.  ""italy totally controlled the game.

2021-06-13,FAQ: What you need to know about the new DIY COVID-19 antigen rapid test kits.,"singapore: covid-19 antigen rapid test (art) kits for self-testing will be dispensed in pharmacies to the public from wednesday (jun 16), the ministry of health (moh) announced on jun 10. arts detect the viral proteins in the nasal swab samples of infected individuals and usually work best in the early stages of infection. four self-test kits have received interim authorisation from the health sciences authority (hsa) to be sold to the general public: the abbott panbio covid-19 antigen self-test, quickvue at-home otc covid-19 test, sd biosensor sars-cov-2 antigen self-test nasal, and sd biosensor standard q covid-19 ag home test. according to the health ministry, these tests produce results in less than 20 minutes. if you're planning to pick some up when they go on sale, here's what you need to know about these self-test kits. q: where can i get the art self-test kits?a: the kits will be available at selected unity, watsons and guardian outlets islandwide. from jun 16, these kits will be dispensed by pharmacists at selected retail pharmacies, said health minister ong ye kung on jun 10. ""we will then open up for counter sales at more retail locations progressively,"" he added. the test kits will be dispensed by the pharmacist in-store, which means customers have to consult a pharmacist before purchasing them.  they can be bought without a doctor's prescription, said hsa in an update on jun 10. according to quantum technologies global, the distributor of the quickvue tests, training will be provided to pharmacists on how to teach customers on the correct usage of the tests. all 79 guardian stores with an in-store pharmacy will carry the covid-19 art kits including the guardian store at the giant outlet in suntec city, said a dairy farm group spokesperson in response to cna's queries. customers can visit guardian's website to use the ""pharmacy"" filter to locate these stores. the abbott panbiotm covid-19 antigen self-test and the quickvue at-home otc covid-19 test will be available at guardian outlets, the spokesperson added. 39 unity pharmacies will offer the test kits from jun 16, said a fairprice spokesperson in response to cna's queries. these stores were ""specially selected"" as they have in-store pharmacists who are ""professionally trained"" to assess whether customers are suitable to use the art kits and provide information on how to use them, said the spokesperson. the abbot panbio covid-19 antigen self-test and quidel quickvue at-home otc covid-19 test kits will be available at all watsons pharmacy stores in the first phase of the test kit roll out, said a spokesperson for the company. the self-test kits will be gradually expanded to more watsons stores and watsons online in the second phase, the spokesperson said in response to cna queries. consumers will be able to locate watsons pharmacy stores using the store finder option on the company's website or via the store locator on the watsons sg mobile app. q: how much will the test kits cost and how many can i buy?sales will initially be limited to 10 art kits per person to ensure that there are ""adequate supplies for all"", said the health ministry's director of medical services kenneth mak on jun 10. but as more supplies are made available for retail sales, authorities will ""eventually allow test kits to be freely purchased"", he said. according to watsons, the pharmacy will be keeping with moh's recommended guidelines for the selling price of the kits.  this ranges from s$10 to s$13 per test kit depending on the size of the pack purchased, said the spokesperson. ""we would advise the public to keep to the guidelines of maximum 10 test kits per customer so as to ensure there would be sufficient test kits for everyone.  we would be monitoring the demands closely and stock up to meet with the consumer needs,"" the spokesperson added. the fairprice spokesperson said that details on the type of kits and pricing are still being finalised, and more information will be available soon. dairy farm's spokesperson also said the company will adhere to moh's pricing guidelines. cna has contacted the ministry for more information about the price of the self-test kits. from jun 16, quantum technologies global will have about 500,000 tests available, and more kits will be flown in from the united states in the coming weeks, said a company spokesperson in response to cna queries. abbott is ""well-positioned"" to fulfill the demand for covid-19 tests, said abbott's apac divisional vice-president for rapid diagnostics sanjeev johar. ""we expect to make millions of panbio antigen rapid tests available for singapore over the coming months, as needed,"" he added. q: how do these test kits work? what should i look out for?those using the self-test kits should collect their nasal sample using the swabs provided in the kits, said hsa in the press release on jun 10. they should then prepare their nasal sample with the buffer and tube provided.  once the sample is ready, users should use it with the test device and read the results, said hsa. while performing the test, users should follow the instructions in the instruction leaflets to get valid results, the authorities said. the instructions for all four self-test kits may differ slightly.  for example, the quickvue test uses a test strip dipped in the buffer solution, while the one manufactured by abbott involves dripping the buffer solution on a rapid test device. ""for children younger than 14 years, an adult caretaker should help collect the nasal samples and conduct the test procedures,"" said abbott. q: are these test kits effective and accurate? what should i do if i test positive?in general, arts can achieve a sensitivity of about 80 per cent for cases with higher viral loads and a specificity range of 97 to 100 per cent, said hsa. sensitivity refers to the test's ability to correctly detect covid-19 in individuals with the , while specificity refers to the test's ability to correctly identify individuals without covid-19. arts have lower sensitivity than the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) tests, which means such tests have a ""higher chance of false negative results"", said hsa in the press release. incorrect sample preparation or testing process when using the test, or a low viral protein level in the user's nasal sample – for example, one to two days after potential exposure to the virus – could also result in a false negative result, hsa added. infectious diseases expert dr leong hoe nam urged users to follow the instructions on how to use the test kits strictly and ""to the letter"". a properly done test will ""carry a similar sensitivity"" to a pcr test, especially if it's repeated every three to five days, he added. ""a negative test doesn't mean you don't have it but you're less likely to have covid-19,"" said dr leong. q: what should i do if i see a positive result?people who have a positive result on these self-test kits should ""immediately approach"" a swab and send home public health preparedness clinic (sash phpc) for a confirmatory pcr test, said moh. after that, they must self-isolate until they receive a negative pcr test result, moh added. those who test negative on their self-test art kit should continue to stay vigilant and adhere to prevailing safe management measures, said the health ministry. ""individuals who have ari symptoms should continue to visit a doctor for a full diagnosis and pcr test instead of relying on an art self-test kit.

general public: the abbott panbio covid-19 antigen self-test, quickvue at-home otc covid-19 test, sd biosensor sars-cov-2 antigen self-test nasal, and sd biosensor standard q covid-19 ag home test.', 'according to the health ministry, these tests produce results in less than 20 minutes.', ""if you're planning to pick some up when they go on sale, here's what you need to know about these self-test kits."", 'q: where can i get the art self-test kits?a: the kits will be available at selected unity, watsons and guardian outlets islandwide.', 'from jun 16, these kits will be dispensed by pharmacists at selected retail pharmacies, said health minister ong ye kung on jun 10.', '""we will then open up for counter sales at more retail locations progressively,"" he added.', 'the test kits will be dispensed by the pharmacist in-store, which means customers have to consult a pharmacist before purchasing them.', ""they can be bought without a doctor's prescription, said hsa in an update on jun 10. according to quantum technologies global, the distributor of the quickvue tests, training will be provided to pharmacists on how to teach customers on the correct usage of the tests."", ""all 79 guardian stores with an in-store pharmacy will carry the covid-19 art kits including the guardian store at the giant outlet in suntec city, said a dairy farm group spokesperson in response to cna's queries."", 'customers can visit guardian\'s website to use the ""pharmacy"" filter to locate these stores.', 'the abbott panbiotm covid-19 antigen self-test and the quickvue at-home otc covid-19 test will be available at guardian outlets, the spokesperson added.', ""39 unity pharmacies will offer the test kits from jun 16, said a fairprice spokesperson in response to cna's queries."", 'these stores were ""specially selected"" as they have in-store pharmacists who are ""professionally trained"" to assess whether customers are suitable to use the art kits and provide information on how to use them, said the spokesperson.', 'the abbot panbio covid-19 antigen self-test and quidel quickvue at-home otc covid-19 test kits will be available at all watsons pharmacy stores in the first phase of the test kit roll out, said a spokesperson for the company.', 'the self-test kits will be gradually expanded to more watsons stores and watsons online in the second phase, the spokesperson said in response to cna queries.', ""consumers will be able to locate watsons pharmacy stores using the store finder option on the company's website or via the store locator on the watsons sg mobile app."", 'q: how much will the test kits cost and how many can i buy?sales will initially be limited to 10 art kits per person to ensure that there are ""adequate supplies for all"",

release on jun 10. they should then prepare their nasal sample with the buffer and tube provided.', 'once the sample is ready, users should use it with the test device and read the results, said hsa.', 'while performing the test, users should follow the instructions in the instruction leaflets to get valid results, the authorities said.', 'the instructions for all four self-test kits may differ slightly.', 'for example, the quickvue test uses a test strip dipped in the buffer solution, while the one manufactured by abbott involves dripping the buffer solution on a rapid test device.', '""for children younger than 14 years, an adult caretaker should help collect the nasal samples and conduct the test procedures,"" said abbott.', 'q: are these test kits effective and accurate?', 'what should i do if i test positive?in general, arts can achieve a sensitivity of about 80 per cent for cases with higher viral loads and a specificity range of 97 to 100 per cent, said hsa.',

2021-06-13,Singapore-Australia travel corridor may take months to open.,"
                    friday, 11 jun 2021
                the meeting between australia's pm scott morrison and singapore leader lee hsien loong on thursday (june 10) was the first in-person meeting between them in more than a year.  the straits times/annsingapore, june 11 (bloomberg): a planned quarantine-free travel corridor between australia and singapore may take months to open because of delays to australia's covid-19 vaccination programme. the two countries are ""putting systems in place that will enable such a bubble to emerge between singapore and australia as it does now occur between australia and new zealand, "" australia prime minister scott morrison said at a joint virtual press conference after meeting singapore prime minister lee hsien loong on thursday. he cautioned that any corridor is still some time away. such a bubble hinges on vaccination rates, lee told reporters.  ""once the majority of the population is vaccinated, it becomes much easier for us to contemplate these openings up, "" he said. that means an operational air-travel corridor could be months away, at least. only about 5. 5 million out of 26 million australians have had at least one jab, meaning some border restrictions are likely to remain well into next year.  morrison's government has abandoned its original october target to inoculate the population. singapore and australia are among a handful of asia-pacific countries that have managed to contain the coronavirus and have been reluctant to ease border restrictions. australia has largely closed its shores to non-citizens and residents since last year, while singapore doesn't allow most short-term visitors to enter, except for those under programs such as a green lane for business travelers. australia's strategy of eliminating covid-19 cases within the community has come under increasing pressure due to leaks of the virus into the community from hotels used to quarantine australians returning from overseas, triggering localised lockdowns.  melbourne, the second-most populous city with more than five million people, exited a two-week lockdown on friday. morrison said discussions between the nations have included giving priority to students from singapore to return to australia to complete their studies.  that would be a ""first opportunity"" for increased travel between the nations, he said. ""when all the preparations are ready, then we can start small with an air-travel bubble to build confidence, "" lee said at the media conference. morrison was on an official visit to the city-state, and is due in the u. k.  to attend the group of seven leaders' summit this weekend.  bloomberg

2021-06-13,COVID-19 Jabs of Pfizer & Moderna May Lead to Inflamed Heart.,"the covid-19 vaccine task force of the u. s.  centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) stated that it has observed increased cases of heart inflammation in adolescents and younger adults, especially aged 12 to 24, following inoculation with authorized mrna-based covid-19 vaccines from moderna mrna, and pfizer pfe/biontech bntx. several hundreds of cases of myocarditis and pericarditis, both conditions of heart inflammation, were reported to the u. s.  government's vaers (vaccine adverse event reporting system) following dose 1 of any mrna-based vaccine in the last two months.  please note that vaers is a national early warning system to detect possible safety problems in u. s.  licensed vaccines.  the number of cases increased further after the second dose of these vaccines.  moreover, the cases occurred in higher number of younger patients following dose 2 compared to dose 1.  the cdc stated that similar inflammation cases were not reported following vaccination with j&j's jnj adenovirus-based covid-19 vaccine. per a reuters report, the israel's health ministry raised the alarm when it reported a likely link of heart inflammation in young men vaccinated with pfizer's bnt162b earlier this month.  following this report, the cdc and health regulators in other countries started investigating such cases. although the number of reported cases is small compared to total inoculations with mrna vaccines, they were higher than expected in the younger age groups. we note that the cdc is yet to link these adverse events to mrna vaccines and has scheduled a meeting of the advisory committee on immunization practices (acip) on jun 18 to discuss and assess the heart inflammation reports.  moreover, the government authority has recommended continuation of vaccination for everyone of age 12 or older given the risk of covid-19 illness and related complications. however, we note that the cdc report also stated that more than 50% of heart inflammation cases were reported in the age group of 12-24 that has received only 8. 8% of vaccine doses.  this suggests that any adverse outcome from the acip meeting scheduled next week can hamper vaccination with mrna vaccines in the adolescent patient group, and hurt prospects of these vaccine developers.  however, the percentage of inflammation cases suggests that the risk from these vaccines is significantly lower than their benefits.  a cdc study claims that these vaccines are 91% effective.  moreover, most patients facing inflammation issues quickly felt better following medication and rest. we remind investors that pfizer/biontech's covid-19 vaccine received authorization for emergency use in adolescents last month from the fda.  moderna filed for a similar authorization in the united states, europe and canada earlier this month. meanwhile, pfizer and biontech have pledged two billion doses of their covid-19 vaccines to ensure equitable access to their vaccines globally.  as part of the pledge, the company plans to supply 200 million doses in 2021 and 300 million doses in the first half of 2022 to the u. s.  government at not-for-profit price.  the government will donate these doses to low- and lower middle-income countries and organizations that support them. while moderna and pfizer carry a zacks rank #3 (hold), biontech sports a zacks rank of 1 (strong buy).  you can see the complete list of today's zacks #1 rank stocks here. in addition to the stocks you read about above, would you like to see zacks' top picks to capitalize on the internet of things (iot)? it is one of the fastest-growing technologies in history, with an estimated 77 billion devices to be connected by 2025.  that works out to 127 new devices per second. zacks has released a special report to help you capitalize on the internet of things's exponential growth.  it reveals 4 under-the-radar stocks that could be some of the most profitable holdings in your portfolio in 2021 and beyond. click here to download this report free >>want the latest recommendations from zacks investment research? today, you can download 7 best stocks for the next 30 days.  click to get this free report johnson & johnson (jnj) : free stock analysis report pfizer inc.

2021-06-13,Football: Eriksen's former cardiologist says he had no history of heart concerns.,"denmark midfielder christian eriksen, who was hospitalised after collapsing during his side's euro 2020 opener against finland on saturday (jun 12), had no prior heart issues during his time with premier league club tottenham hotspur, his former cardiologist said. eriksen, 29, collapsed in the 42nd minute of the match while running near the left touchline after a denmark throw-in and was given life-saving cardiac massage treatment on the pitch, with officials later saying that the player was stable and awake. dr sanjay sharma of st.  george's university of london said eriksen had returned normal tests since 2013, but the sight of the inter milan playmaker falling to the ground had briefly raised concerns that doctors had missed something. ""i thought, 'oh my god? is there something there that we didn't see?' but i have looked at all the test results and everything looked perfect,"" sharma told the mail on sunday. ""from the day we signed him, it was my job to screen him and we tested him every year.  so certainly his tests up to 2019 were completely normal, with no obvious underlying cardiac fault.  i can vouch for that because i did the tests.

""it brought back stuff that i have put down in me, this emotion that's down there.  to watch it from that distance and not know what was going to happen,"" muamba told the bbc.

ST reporter tries it out, Health News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore from june 16, self-administered covid-19 test kits will be sold in pharmacies here as increased testing becomes part of the ""new normal"" way of life with the coronavirus. having previously undergone five different types of covid-19 swabs, including one done by a robot, i decided to try one of these do-it-yourself test kits to see what the process was like, and how it compared with the other types of tests. the kit i tried was the abbott panbio covid-19 antigen self-test.  another test that will be available is the quidel quickvue at-home otc covid-19 test. these two will be sold at watsons outlets for around $10 to $13 per test kit. two more, the sd biosensor sars-cov-2 antigen self-test nasal, and the sd biosensor standard q covid-19 ag home test, have been approved for use here by the health sciences authority. the abbott panbio sample kit came in a blue rectangular box the size of a pencil case.  inside, there were an instruction manual, a swab, a test device, a tiny bottle of solution, and a tube to hold the mixture.  a resealable plastic bag was also provided for waste disposal. before starting, i had to wash and dry my hands.  then, i had to squeeze liquid from the bottle into the tube, making sure it was filled up to a specific level. setting the tube of liquid aside, i went on to the swab.  removing the stick from its sealed packaging, i took a deep breath and gently pushed it into my nostril. this was the most difficult step for me as i was not sure whether the swab had gone sufficiently deep inside. the instructions said to insert it about 2cm deep, until resistance was felt, but being paranoid i was not 100 per cent confident that i was feeling enough resistance.  i should perhaps have done this in front of a mirror. i then rotated the swab five times as instructed, ensuring i felt it gently rub the insides of my nose. this step had to be repeated for the other nostril with the same swab.  at this point, i was a little more confident of my abilities, and felt more relaxed. next, i put the stick into the tube of liquid and swirled it, before breaking off the swab along a demarcated line and leaving it in the tube. i then squeezed five droplets from the tube into the test device.  i did not need to worry about spilling as there was more than enough liquid in the tube. almost instantly, the display face of the test device began to turn red.  it felt like i was carrying out a science experiment at home.

fifteen minutes later, i checked the device and saw that nearly all the redness had disappeared, leaving a single line on the control indicator a negative result.  a positive result would show two red lines. with a sigh of relief, i sealed the used equipment in the resealable bag and threw it in the bin.  the entire kit can be used only once, and no, i didn't want to keep it as a souvenir. overall, i found the test quick and simple to use.  it was definitely much less uncomfortable than the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) swab tests i had taken in the past because the swab did not have to be put all the way up my nose, and for me at least it was completely painless. while i was initially surprised by the number of steps required, the manual was very detailed, contained helpful diagrams, and was easy to follow.

dr ling li min, an infectious diseases specialist at rophi clinic, told me that although there may be some minor variations between the four approved kits, all are antigen rapid tests (arts) and should work the same way. unlike pcr tests, which detect genetic material from the coronavirus, arts look for antigens, which are the protein shells that cover the virus, she explained. dr ling, who was previously a senior consultant at the national centre for infectious diseases and tan tock seng hospital, said there are membranes in the test kit containing antibodies. when the solution is dripped on the test kit, it flows through the membranes.  if there are antigens present, the antibodies will bind with them and form a line on the display.

while arts are faster and less uncomfortable than pcr tests, they are less sensitive.  dr ling said that generally, pcr tests can detect the virus in someone who has symptoms in their first week of illness about 90 to 95 per cent of the time.  arts can do this for an estimated 70 to 80 per cent of cases. however, dr ling noted that arts have a specificity rate of nearly 100 per cent, which means that a positive result is very likely correct. ""if it's positive, you must really quickly go and see a doctor.  the chance of a false positive is very, very low,"" she said. she cautioned that those using diy test kits must read and follow the instructions even if they have used a different brand before as there may be some variations, and the reliability of the result depends on people doing the test correctly. but while such kits may not be suitable for those who are unable to follow instructions or have trouble carrying out the test on their own, such as the very old or young, dr ling said they have an important part to play in the nation's overall strategy to combat covid-19. this is because such kits can help increase the frequency of tests done here, potentially allowing cases to be detected and tackled before they turn into clusters. from a psychological point of view, they can also help give peace of mind to people who want to know if they are infected, she said. dr ling added: ""if we do it well and properly, and if enough people buy into it, it's one way to keep from needing heightened restrictions every now and then, and we can carry on with our lives. . .  simply through more testing that people are going to be comfortable with.

2021-06-13,"'Life goes on, it's just tennis,' says Nadal after French Open reign ends.","paris: rafael nadal shrugged off his epic loss to novak djokovic at the french open insisting ""life goes on"" as the 13-time champion suffered just his third ever defeat in 108 matches in paris over 16 years. in their 58th career clash, world number one djokovic triumphed 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 in the semi-final and stays on course to capture a 19th major and become the first man in over 50 years to win all four slams twice. nadal, the defending champion and chasing a record-setting 21st grand slam title, refused to dwell on the consequences of his 4-hour 11-minute loss. ""i am sad to have lost in the most important tournament of the year for me, but life goes on, it is nothing more than a defeat on a tennis court,"" said 35-year-old nadal. ""if everything goes well, tomorrow i will be at home with my family and friends, and then we will see what is next. ""nadal said he plans to be back in 2022 although admitting that time is not on his side if he wants to re-establish his paris dominance. had he made sunday's championship match, he would have been the oldest roland garros finalist in the modern era. ""although it is a very important tournament for me, i am aware that you cannot win it 15 or 16 times,"" he added. ""next year i will come again, god willing, with the belief and with the necessary work to be able to give myself another chance. ""in their 58th career meeting, and ninth at the french open, nadal had looked comfortably on course for victory when he raced to a 5-0 lead in the first set. but 2016 champion djokovic, the man now responsible for two of nadal's losses in paris having also triumphed in the 2015 quarter-finals, hit back. ""did not hurt him""as the match progressed into the later heavier, humid and slower conditions, the world number one flourished. he claimed a titanic 92-minute third set which had seen him serve for it at 5-4 and then have to save a set point in the 12th game. in the fourth set, he was 0-2 down before racing away with the next six games for his second win in paris over nadal in nine meetings. that sequence also included defeats in the 2012, 2014 and 2020 finals. djokovic will now be playing in his sixth roland garros final and 29th at the slams. ""in the end, of course, if you win the third set you can say that was the key, because it changes the dynamic,"" said nadal. ""at times, my ball did not hurt him.  you have to give him credit, congratulate him, but i know i can play better on this court. ""when asked if he had faced the best djokovic performance of their 15-year rivalry, he was adamant. ""no, that's what i feel.  he has not faced my best self either. ""there were games on the limit, games that anyone could win, and today it was for him. ""despite that, there is a degree of evidence that nadal is beginning to lose more epics than he wins at the slams. at the australian open in february, he lost to stefanos tsitsipas from two sets up in a five-set quarter-final defeat. tsitsipas, who faces djokovic in sunday's final, is 13 years younger than nadal. in the wimbledon semi-finals in 2018, nadal lost a final set 10-8 to djokovic after quitting injured in the fifth set of his australian open semi against marin cilic earlier that same year. even gilles muller of luxembourg beat him at wimbledon in 2017, courtesy of a 15-13 final set. ""it doesn't matter,"" added a rueful nadal.  ""that's tennis.  the player who gets used to the conditions better is the player who deserves to win.

2021-06-13,"What it is like to take a DIY Covid-19 test, Health News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. from wednesday, self-administered covid-19 test kits will be sold in pharmacies here as increased testing becomes part of the ""new normal"" way of life with the coronavirus. having previously undergone five different types of covid-19 swabs, including one done by a robot, i decided to try using a do-it-yourself (diy) test kit to see what the process was like, and how it compared with the other types of tests. the kit i tried was the abbott panbio covid-19 antigen self-test.  another test that will be available here is the quidel quickvue at-home otc covid-19 test. these will be sold at watsons outlets for about $10 to $13 a kit. two others, the sd biosensor sars-cov-2 antigen self-test nasal and the sd biosensor standard q covid-19 ag home test, have been approved for use here by the health sciences authority. the abbott panbio sample kit came in a blue rectangular box the size of a pencil case.  inside were an instruction manual, a swab, a test device, a tiny bottle of solution and a tube to hold the mixture.  a resealable plastic bag was also provided for waste disposal. before starting, i had to wash and dry my hands.  then i had to squeeze liquid from the bottle into the tube, making sure it was filled up to a specific level. setting the tube of liquid aside, i went on to the swab.  removing the stick from its sealed packaging, i took a deep breath and gently pushed it into my nostril. this was the most difficult step for me as i was not sure whether the swab had gone sufficiently deep inside. the instructions said to insert it about 2cm deep, until resistance was felt, but being paranoid i was not 100 per cent confident that i was feeling enough resistance.  i should perhaps have done this in front of a mirror. i then rotated the swab five times as instructed, ensuring that i felt it gently rubbing against the insides of my nose. this step had to be repeated for the other nostril with the same swab.  at this point, i was a little more confident of my abilities and felt more relaxed. next, i put the stick into the tube of liquid and swirled it before breaking off the swab along a demarcated line and leaving it in the tube. i then squeezed five droplets from the tube into the test device.  i did not need to worry about accidentally spilling it as there was more than enough liquid in the tube. almost instantly, the display face of the test device began to turn red.  it felt like i was carrying out a science experiment at home. fifteen minutes later, i checked the device and saw that nearly all the redness had disappeared, leaving a single line on the control indicator a negative result.  a positive result would show two red lines. with a sigh of relief, i sealed the used equipment in the resealable bag and threw it in the bin.  the entire kit can be used only once, and no, i did not want to keep it as a souvenir. overall, i found the test quick and simple to use.  it was definitely much less uncomfortable than the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) swab tests i had taken in the past because the swab did not have to be put all the way up my nose, and for me at least it was completely painless. while i was initially surprised by the number of steps required, the manual was detailed, had helpful diagrams and was easy to follow. dr ling li min, an infectious diseases specialist at rophi clinic, told me that although there may be some minor variations between the four kits approved for use here, all are antigen rapid tests (arts) and should work the same way. unlike pcr tests, which detect genetic material from the coronavirus, arts look for antigens, which are the protein shells that cover the virus, she explained. dr ling, who was previously a senior consultant at the national centre for infectious diseases and tan tock seng hospital, said there are membranes in the test kit containing antibodies. when the solution is dripped onto the test kit, it flows through the membranes.  if there are antigens present, the antibodies will bind with them and form a line on the display. while arts are faster and less uncomfortable than pcr tests, they are less sensitive.  dr ling said that generally, pcr tests can detect the virus in someone who has symptoms in their first week of illness about 90 per cent to 95 per cent of the time.  arts can do this for an estimated 70 per cent to 80 per cent of cases. however, dr ling noted that arts have a specificity rate of nearly 100 per cent, which means that a positive result is very likely correct. ""if it is positive, you must really quickly go and see a doctor.  the chance of a false positive is very, very low,"" she said. she cautioned that those using diy test kits must read and follow the instructions even if they have used a different brand before as there may be some variations, and the reliability of the result depends on people doing the test correctly. but while such kits may not be suitable for those who are unable to follow instructions or have trouble carrying out the test on their own, such as the very old or young, dr ling said they have an important part to play in the nation's overall strategy to combat covid-19. this is because such kits can help increase the frequency of tests done here, potentially allowing cases to be detected and tackled before they turn into clusters. from a psychological point of view, they can also help give peace of mind to people who want to know if they are infected, she said. dr ling said: ""if we do it well and properly, and if enough people buy into it, it is one way to keep from needing heightened restrictions every now and then, and we can carry on with our lives. . .  simply through more testing that people are going to be comfortable with.

self-administered covid-19 test kits will be sold in pharmacies here as increased testing becomes part of the ""new normal"" way of life with the coronavirus.', 'having previously undergone five different types of covid-19 swabs, including one done by a robot, i decided to try using a do-it-yourself (diy) test kit to see what the process was like, and how it compared with the other types of tests.', 'the kit i tried was the abbott panbio covid-19 antigen self-test.', 'another test that will be available here is the quidel quickvue at-home otc covid-19 test.', 'these will be sold at watsons outlets for about $10 to $13 a kit.', 'two others, the sd biosensor sars-cov-2 antigen self-test nasal and the sd biosensor standard q covid-19 ag home test, have been approved for use here by the health sciences authority.', 'the abbott panbio sample kit came in a blue rectangular box the size of a pencil case.', 'inside were an instruction manual, a swab, a test device, a tiny bottle of solution and a tube to hold the mixture.', 'a resealable plastic bag was also provided for waste disposal.', 'before starting, i had to wash and dry my hands.', 'then i had to squeeze liquid from the bottle into the tube, making sure it was filled up to a specific level.', 'setting the tube of liquid aside, i went on to the swab.', 'removing the stick from its sealed packaging, i took a deep breath and gently pushed it into my nostril.', 'this was the most difficult step for me as i was not sure whether the swab had gone sufficiently deep inside.', 'the instructions said to insert it about 2cm deep, until resistance was felt, but being paranoid i was not 100 per cent confident that i was feeling enough resistance.', 'i should perhaps have done this in front of a mirror.', 'i then rotated the swab five times as instructed, ensuring that i felt it gently rubbing against the insides of my nose.', 'this step had to be repeated for the other nostril with the same swab.', 'at this point, i was a little more confident of my abilities and felt more relaxed.', 'next, i put the stick into the tube of liquid and swirled it before breaking off the swab along a demarcated line and leaving it in the tube.', 'i then squeezed five droplets from the tube into the test device.', 'i did not need to worry about accidentally spilling it as there was more than enough liquid in the tube.', 'almost instantly, the display face of the test device began to turn red.', 'it felt like i was carrying out a science experiment at home.', 'fifteen minutes later, i checked the device and saw that nearly all the redness had disappeared, leaving a single line on the control indicator a negative result.', 'a positive result would show two red lines.', 'with a sigh of relief, i sealed the used equipment in the resealable bag and threw it in the bin.', 'the entire kit can be used only once, and no, i did not want to keep it as a souvenir.', 'overall, i found the test quick and simple to use.', 'it was definitely much less uncomfortable than the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) swab tests i had taken in the past because the swab did not have to be put all the way up my nose, and for me at least it was completely painless.', 'while i was initially surprised by the number of steps required, the manual was detailed, had helpful diagrams and was easy to follow.', 'dr ling li min, an infectious diseases specialist at rophi clinic, told me that although there may be some minor variations between the four kits approved for use here, all are antigen rapid tests (arts) and should work the same way.', 'unlike pcr tests, which detect genetic material from the coronavirus, arts look for antigens, which are the protein shells that cover the virus, she explained.', 'dr ling, who was previously a senior consultant at the national centre for infectious diseases and tan tock seng hospital, said there are membranes in the test kit containing antibodies.', 'when the solution is dripped onto the test kit, it flows through the membranes.', 'if there are antigens present, the antibodies will bind with them and form a line on the display.', 'while arts are faster and less uncomfortable than pcr tests, they are less sensitive.', 'dr ling said that generally, pcr tests can detect the virus in someone who has symptoms in their first week of illness about 90 per cent to 95 per cent of the time.', 'arts can do this for an estimated 70 per cent to 80 per cent of cases.', 'however, dr ling noted that arts have a specificity rate of nearly 100 per cent, which means that a positive result is very likely correct.', '""if it is positive, you must really quickly go and see a doctor.', 'the chance of a false positive is very, very low,"" she said.', 'she cautioned that those using diy test kits must read and follow the instructions even if they have used a different brand before as there may be some variations, and the reliability of the result depends on people doing the test correctly.', ""but while such kits may not be suitable for those who are unable to follow instructions or have trouble carrying out the test on their own, such as the very old or young, dr ling said they have an important part to play in the nation's overall strategy to combat covid-19."", 'this is because such kits can help increase the frequency of tests done here, potentially allowing cases to be detected and tackled before they turn into clusters.', 'from a psychological point of view, they can also help give peace of mind to people who want to know if they are infected, she said.', 'dr ling said: ""if we do it well and properly, and if enough people buy into it, it is one way to keep from needing heightened restrictions every now and then, and we can carry on with

2021-06-13,Man who assaulted police officer 'did not like' his face.,"singapore — a secret society member who brutally assaulted a police officer and caused him to suffer a traumatic brain injury with help from his twin brother was jailed for two years, nine months and four weeks on friday (11 june). muhammad farhan jaffri and his twin brother muhammad fiqkri jaffri, both 26, attacked sergeant chong jiawei, 27, a ground response officer who was on patrol duty on 23 february last year. the attack left chong unconscious and incapacitated, and he was given 29 days of leave due to his injuries. farhan, who pleaded guilty to five charges of causing grievous hurt and hurt to a public servant, vandalism, being a member of a secret society and using abusive language on a public servant, was also given three strokes of the cane and fined $3,500.  four charges of a similar nature were considered for his sentencing.  fiqkri's case is still pending before the courts.  he faces seven charges, including causing grievous hurt to a public servant.  on 23 february last year, at about 4am, farhan, who was drunk, was having an argument with his wife at the void deck of block 755 jurong west street 74 when a member of the public called the police over the commotion. four police officers, including chong, were dispatched to the location, and they saw farhan's wife in tears.  a female police officer was checking on the wife when farhan became defensive.  at this point, fiqkri arrived and approached the officers aggressively, pointing his finger at the officers and demanding to know why they were questioning his brother. fiqkri asked farhan and his wife to return to his unit and asked the police officers to ""shut up"".  farhan left but verbally abused the female police officer first. within minutes, farhan returned and shouted that he did not like the faces of the officers.  his twin asked farhan whose face he did not like and farhan gestured at chong's face. fiqkri turned to chong and swung his fist at the officer's face.  chong fell to the ground and farhan joined him in assaulting the police officer.  farhan and fiqkri rained punches and kicks on the officer, despite attempts by the other officers to restrain the brothers. the brothers hurt another male officer, who was on reservist, during the struggle.  their violence prompted the female police officer to draw her baton and call for reinforcement.  they finally managed to handcuff fiqkri.  two other police officers arrived and handcuffed farhan. after farhan was escorted into the police vehicle, he yelled and knocked his head on the window repeatedly.  he then kicked the window three times, causing the right rear window to shatter.  at that point in time, one officer was standing guard beside the right rear seat of the vehicle.  the damage cost $201.  farhan has since made full restitution. chong was conveyed to hospital.  his medical report, dated 9 march last year, stated that as a result for the attack, chong slumped to the ground and briefly lost consciousness.  he was diagnosed with abrasions over his eyelid, laceration over his ear, facial bruises, and a concussion.  he was admitted for two days into the neurosurgery ward for monitoring. due to his traumatic head injury, chong was given 29 days of hospitalisation leave.  the other officer who was injured had bruises and abrasion over his head.  both officers' medical bills were covered by service insurance. deputy public prosecutor chng luey chi sought a jail term of between 39 months and 4 weeks, and 39 months and 6 weeks, along with three strokes of the cane and a fine of $3,500 against farhan. citing chong's victim impact statement, dpp chng told the court that the police officer was deployed to an administrative role for a month before returning to a frontline role. ""this was to help the victim build up confidence in the execution of his duties as a frontline officer.  moreover, the incident had caused the victim worries about how his supervisors might perceive his abilities,"" said dpp chng. the manner of the attack was ""sustained, brutal, and cruel"", said dpp chng, who noted that farhan had attacked the officer simply because he ""did not like"" chong's face. voluntarily causing grievous hurt to a public servant carries a jail term of up to 15 years, and fine or caning.  causing hurt to a public servant carries a jail term of seven years and fine or caning.  stay in the know on-the-go: join yahoo singapore's telegram channel at http://t. me/yahoosingaporeother singapore stories:hsa busts vision empire illegal mask manufacturing facilitysingapore and australia to work towards air travel bubble, with priority on studentssingapore-hk atb review in july, no 'firm plans' for south korea travel bubblecyclist who punched lorry driver along jalan eunos fined $5,600man assaulted private hire car driver in road rage incidentchina's quick rollout of a law against foreign sanctions has left european and american companies shocked and facing ""irreconcilable"" compliance issues, two top business groups said friday, despite beijing saying the move would unlikely impact investment. the ministry of health (moh) on friday (11 june) confirmed nine new covid-19 cases in singapore, bringing the country's total case count to 62,245. få flere penge i hverdagen ved at samle din gæld.  indsend en ansøgning her og få et tilbud.  indfri lånet når du ønsker det. it is compulsory to have your car insured in singapore.  why not make the most of it by looking for the best car insurance plan in town when your policy is up for renewal? while it can be tempting to simply renew your existing car [. . . ] the post 5 best car insurance plans in singapore (2021) appeared first on singsaver blog we compare, you save. second minister for education maliki osman has taken to facebook to express his shock and disappointment at alleged islamophobic remarks made by a ngee ann polytechnic (np) lecturer. a 24-year-old man who was seen naked in public in several photos and videos circulating online has been arrested by the police. kia proceed betager med flot design, imponerende udstyr og stor power. what if china were to cut off the united states and europe from access to rare minerals that are essential to electric vehicles, wind turbines and drones?newly-crowned french open champion barbora krejcikova hailed her mentor and former wimbledon champion jana novotna who died in 2017, saying: ""at the end of her life, i had to be there.

2021-06-13,'It doesn't get any better'.,"italy star ciro immobile basked in his goal against turkey on friday as he and his team-mates embraced fans returning to the stands after more than a year of battling the coronavirus. immobile scored the second of italy's goals, leading the way in a 3-0 win that also included a finish from lorenzo insigne and an unfortunate own goal from merih demiral. italy's euro 2020-opening win came at the stadio olimpico, home of immobile's club team lazio, making the striker's goal even sweeter. ""seeing the fans celebrate after all this time was wonderful, we finally got to come together after so long of this damned virus,"" immobile told rai sport. ""i think we showed patience this evening.  turkey are a strong side and caused problems for many top teams.  we tried to tire them out in the first half, moving the ball left and right, trying to spread them. ""unfortunately, we regularly hit their brick wall, especially as we're not that good in the air.  turkey were more tired after the break, and after the goal they had to open up some spaces, so that's when our quality emerged. ""scoring a goal on the euros debut in my stadium, it doesn't get better. ""immobile wasn't the only one moved by friday's match, as man of the match leonardo spinazzola admitted it was an emotional day. italy was one of the countries hit hardest by the coronavirus over the last year, and seeing fans in the stadium once again was something special to the italy defender. ""the emotions started on the bus towards the stadium, seeing all the people in the streets.  it really did give us goosebumps,"" he told sky sport italia. ""it was a perfect performance.  we were patient, we moved the ball around well.  then afterwards i saw my son in the stands, it was emotional. ""  italy kickstarted the tournament in style with the 3-0 win in what was their first ever three-goal performance at the euros. the azzurri are seen by many as a contender to make a deep run into the tournament, although they haven't received the same attention as some of the other tournament favourites. friday's result will no doubt give them some momentum heading through the rest of the group stages and perhaps even into the knockout rounds going forward. ""when you start this adventure, you need some tension, some goosebumps, the desire to get out there.  i imagined it'd be like this because of the path we took to get here,"" defender leonardo bonucci told sky sport italia. ""now this is the first in a long journey, so we keep our feet on the ground, as it's going to be a run of very close games, the opponents will get to know us better, but we know that we can have our say.

2021-06-13,Commentary: The merits of Singapore’s new carbon trading marketplace.,"climate impact x is a welcome addition to the country's climate action initiatives that provide new economic opportunities, help price discovery and can aid future compliance, say energy researchers. singapore: singapore took another big step in advancing the green agenda last month. the country on may 20 announced plans to position itself as a hub for carbon services. climate impact x (cix) is a joint venture between the development bank of singapore, singapore exchange, standard chartered bank and temasek holdings. first envisioned by the emerging stronger taskforce's alliance for action on sustainability, cix will provide a marketplace for trading carbon credits commencing in late 2021. singapore is well-suited to hosting a carbon marketplace.  it is an ideal base for multinational companies working on projects that generate emission credits across the region. as a regional leader for commodities trading, singapore also deals with many energy majors and traders who will form a large part of the clientele for carbon market ancillary services. there are already around 30 firms here offering carbon consulting services, which include low-carbon project development, consulting and verification for the registration of certified emissions-reduction credits, carbon footprint measurement, project financing and legal services. the launch of a carbon marketplace can attract more of such consultancies in a key growth industry. (what will cix bring to the table of carbon trading and climate action? find out on the climate conversations. )a welcome addition to singapore's climate action initiativescix is a welcome addition to the suite of emission-cutting initiatives and institutions in singapore that helps the country accelerate its peak and net-zero emissions timelines. under the paris agreement, singapore'snationally determined contributionis to peak emissions at 65 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent around 2030.  singapore also seeks to halve peak emissions to 33 million tonnes by 2050 and achieve net zero emissions as soon as viable during the second half of the century. a key innovation of cix includes provisions for trading nature-based solutions. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid. nature-based climate solutions like mangroves, wetlands and forests can absorb vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. a recent study by researchers at the nus centre for nature-based climate solutions estimates reforestation in southeast asia can contribute to 3. 4 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions reductions per year.  reforestation, coupled with supply chain transparency and harmonised standards for carbon offsets, can translate into a ready source of carbon credits. as an exchange focused on such carbon credits, cix will enhance the climate finance ecosystem within singapore and expand the range of mechanisms for firms to manage and price their carbon externalities.  google, microsoft and amazon are said to be in talks to use cix in their journey to become net-zero emitters. moreover, it offers another way for singapore to widen the international scope of its environmental management activities. the right price for carboncix can aid with the adjustment of singapore's carbon tax – which came into effect in january 2019 – by expanding the array of tools used for pricing carbon in singapore. this will permit the singapore government some freedom when discussing future, probably upward revision to the current tax, since local firms will have the ability to defray their ""carbon costs"" in other ways. the current tax rate of s$5 per tonne of co2 can be contested for three reasons.  first, the abatement costs are typically considered much higher, and ideally, carbon price would reflect the cost of abatement.  a world bank report published in may notes that a price of us$40 to us$80 (s$50 to s$100) per tonne of co2 is needed to meet the 2 degrees celsius goal. second, the s$5 price tag might not fully capture carbon embedded in international supply chains and trade. this has spurred debate around the need for carbon border adjustment mechanisms – a tool for ensuring that domestic and imported goods price their embodied emissions equally, thereby discouraging trade with high-polluting countries that do not have effective carbon pricing mechanisms of their own. third, singapore's carbon pricing is arguably not a sufficiently liquid mechanism because it changes infrequently. the government has plans to increase the tax rate to between s$10 and s$15 per tonne by 2030.  the tax level and trajectory post-2023 will be reviewed by 2022, in consultation with industry and expert groups in order to give businesses and opportunity to adjust to changes. there is wisdom in introducing market-based mechanisms to facilitate the price discovery process and allow emissions to be priced into commercial decisions. in the absence of such a mechanism, finding the right price for carbon is complex.  it requires striking a balance between reducing the carbon footprint of industries and increasing the costs of doing business, which may negatively impact the competitiveness of singapore's economy. however, with the pandemic still evolving, the success of singapore's carbon services hub should not be assumed.  increased and quantifiable demand for carbon offsets also suggest an upward trend in emissions-intensive activities in the near term. getting companies to play ballthe cix is also a first step to getting companies to play ball on singapore's climate obligations. demand for carbon offsets could arise from several sources.  companies currently paying carbon taxes may purchase credits to defray their carbon tax liability. similarly, firms or other speculators may purchase credits to trade later for a premium, should this be allowed under the carbon pricing act. retail trade from individuals seeking socially responsible investment options can also be expected. yet singapore must not forget there are no industry-level mandatory reduction targets.  many carbon commitments by corporations in the region are currently voluntary, which may limit market participation. regulation can steward strong market participation.  with rapid global expansion of climate finance, compliance concerns have also grown because of ""greenwash"" – when companies over-inflate the environmental credentials of their projects. the devil is in the details.  regulators must provide robust mechanisms for project verification, monitoring and compliance enforcement not only to prevent greenwash, but also to ensure fair benchmarking across all projects. this could be industry initiated, where carbon credit and offset suppliers commit to co-develop and implement greenhouse gas quantification and reporting methodologies for their respective sectors.  regulators will then be able to assess the methodologies that improve transparency in carbon credit transactions. having recognised the complexity of scaling up global carbon markets, the global institute on finance's taskforce on scaling voluntary carbon markets has launched a consultation on creating ""high-integrity"" markets, due to end in late june.  it seeks to establish ""a threshold standard for high-quality credits, clear legal standards and uniting existing, fragmented carbon credit markets in one impactful, well-run system"". to ensure the integrity and quality of its credits, cix will work with global partners including the taskforce on scaling voluntary carbon markets and the natural climate solutions alliance. it will also use cutting-edge data analytics, such as satellite monitoring, machine learning and blockchain technology to ensure the environmental integrity of credits traded on cix. global rating agencies might be roped in to provide independent environmental ratings for nature-based projects which will issue carbon credits. it is important singapore provides a well-run and trusted market for carbon offsets while expanding emissions-reduction efforts. however, to meet its own national targets, companies must ultimately commit to less carbon-intensive production models and not simply ""pay to play"" by exploiting offsets. melissa low is research fellow at the energy studies institute, national university of singapore.  david

opportunities, help price discovery and can aid future compliance, say energy researchers."", 'singapore: singapore took another big step in advancing the green agenda last month.', 'the country on may 20 announced plans to position itself as a hub for carbon services.', 'climate impact x (cix) is a joint venture between the development bank of singapore, singapore exchange, standard chartered bank and temasek holdings.', ""first envisioned by the emerging stronger taskforce's alliance for action on sustainability, cix will provide a marketplace for trading carbon credits commencing in late 2021. singapore is well-suited to hosting a carbon marketplace."", 'it is an ideal base for multinational companies working on projects that generate emission credits across the region.', 'as a regional leader for commodities trading, singapore also deals with many energy majors and traders who will form a large part of the clientele for carbon market ancillary services.', 'there are already around 30 firms here offering carbon consulting services, which include low-carbon project development, consulting and verification for the registration of certified emissions-reduction credits, carbon footprint measurement, project financing and legal services.', 'the launch of a carbon marketplace can attract more of such consultancies in a key growth industry.', '(what will cix bring to the table of carbon trading and climate action?', 'find out on the climate conversations.', "")a welcome addition to singapore's climate action initiativescix is a welcome addition to the suite of emission-cutting initiatives and institutions in singapore that helps the country accelerate its peak and net-zero emissions timelines."", ""under the paris agreement, singapore'snationally determined

emissions as soon as viable during the second half of the century."", 'a key innovation of cix includes provisions for trading nature-based solutions.', 'it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.', 'nature-based climate solutions like mangroves, wetlands and forests can absorb vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.', 'a recent study by researchers at the nus centre for nature-based climate solutions estimates reforestation in southeast asia can contribute to 3.', '4 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions reductions per year.', 'reforestation, coupled with supply chain transparency and harmonised standards for carbon offsets, can translate into a ready source of carbon credits.', 'as an exchange focused on such carbon credits, cix will enhance the climate finance ecosystem within singapore and expand the range of mechanisms for firms to manage and price their carbon externalities.', 'google, microsoft and amazon are said to be in talks to use cix in their journey to become net-zero emitters.', 'moreover, it offers another way for singapore to widen the international scope of its environmental management activities.', ""the right price for carboncix can aid with the adjustment of singapore's carbon tax – which came into effect in january 2019 – by expanding the array of tools used for pricing carbon in singapore."", 'this will permit the singapore government some freedom when discussing future, probably upward revision to the current tax, since local firms will have the ability to defray their ""carbon costs"" in other ways.', 'the current tax rate of s$5 per tonne of co2 can be contested for three reasons.', 'first, the abatement costs are typically considered much higher, and ideally, carbon price would reflect the cost of abatement.', 'a world bank report published in may notes that a price of us$40 to us$80 (s$50 to s$100) per tonne of co2 is needed to meet the 2 degrees celsius goal.', 'second, the s$5 price tag might not fully capture carbon embedded in international supply chains and trade.', 'this has spurred debate around the need for carbon border adjustment mechanisms – a tool for ensuring that domestic and imported goods price their embodied emissions equally, thereby discouraging trade with high-polluting countries that do not have effective carbon pricing mechanisms of their own.', ""third, singapore's carbon pricing is arguably not a sufficiently liquid mechanism because it changes infrequently."", 'the government has plans to increase the tax rate to between s$10 and s$15 per tonne by 2030.  the tax level and trajectory post-2023 will be reviewed by 2022, in consultation with industry and expert groups in order to give businesses and opportunity to adjust to changes.', 'there is wisdom in introducing market-based mechanisms to facilitate the price discovery process and allow emissions to be priced into commercial decisions.', 'in the absence of such a mechanism, finding the right price for carbon is complex.', ""it requires striking a balance between reducing the carbon footprint of industries and increasing the costs of doing business, which may negatively impact the competitiveness of singapore's economy."", ""however, with the pandemic still evolving, the success of singapore's carbon services hub should not be assumed."", 'increased and quantifiable demand for carbon offsets also suggest an upward trend in emissions-intensive activities in the near term.', ""getting companies to play ballthe cix is also a first step to getting companies to play ball on singapore's climate obligations."", 'demand for carbon offsets could arise from several sources.', 'companies currently paying carbon taxes may purchase credits to defray their carbon tax liability.', 'similarly, firms or other speculators may purchase credits to trade later for a premium, should this be allowed under the carbon pricing act.', 'retail trade from individuals seeking socially responsible investment options can also be expected.', 'yet singapore must not forget there are no industry-level mandatory reduction targets.', 'many carbon commitments by corporations in the region are currently voluntary, which may limit market participation.', 'regulation can steward strong market participation.', 'with rapid global expansion of climate finance, compliance concerns have also grown because of ""greenwash"" – when companies over-inflate the environmental credentials of their projects.', 'the devil is in the details.', 'regulators must provide robust mechanisms for project verification, monitoring and compliance enforcement not only to prevent greenwash, but also to ensure fair benchmarking across all projects.', 'this could be industry initiated, where carbon credit and offset suppliers commit to co-develop and implement greenhouse gas quantification and reporting methodologies for their respective sectors.', 'regulators will then be able to assess the methodologies that improve transparency in carbon credit transactions.', 'having recognised the complexity of scaling up global carbon markets, the global institute on finance\'s taskforce on scaling voluntary carbon markets has launched a consultation on creating ""high-integrity"" markets, due to end in late june.', 'it seeks to establish ""a threshold standard for high-quality credits, clear legal standards and uniting existing, fragmented carbon credit markets in one impactful, well-run system"".', 'to ensure the integrity and quality of its credits, cix will work with global partners including the taskforce on scaling voluntary carbon markets and the natural climate solutions alliance.', 'it will also use cutting-edge data analytics, such as satellite monitoring, machine learning and blockchain technology to ensure the environmental integrity of credits traded on cix.', 'global rating agencies might be roped in to provide independent environmental ratings for nature-based projects which will issue carbon credits.', 'it is important singapore provides a well-run and trusted market for carbon offsets while expanding emissions-reduction efforts.', 'however, to meet its own national targets, companies must ultimately commit to less carbon-intensive production models and not simply ""pay to play"" by exploiting offsets.', 'melissa low is research fellow at the energy

""they understand the challenge, the need for many of the adjustments that they have to make.  there is a certain optimism, that we can get through this. ""asked if there could be more financial support for the sector, mr iswaran said the government remains committed to help, but any aid will be based on an assessment of the situation going forward. responding to queries, cag also said tenants in airport terminals will continue to have their rental fees waived until they are allowed to reopen. jewel changi airport will open from monday, but the terminals will stay closed to the public for now to give the staff some time to get used to the new measures. mr iswaran said the change in operations at the airport is a major one.

2021-06-13,'One of my greatest': Djokovic hails French Open masterpiece against 'Everest' Nadal.,"novak djokovic compared defeating rafael nadal at the french open to scaling mount everest as he hailed friday's epic semi-final triumph over the 13-time champion as ""one of my greatest victories"". djokovic condemned nadal to only his third loss in 16 years and 108 matches at roland garros to reach his sixth paris final after a classic showdown which even beat the country's covid-19 curfew. in their 58th career clash, djokovic triumphed 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 and stays on course to capture a 19th major and become the first man in over 50 years to win all four slams twice. djokovic, the 2016 champion in paris who had also beaten nadal in the 2015 quarter-finals, will face stefanos tsitsipas in sunday's final in what will be his 29th championship match at the slams. tsitsipas had earlier become the first greek to reach a grand slam final with a 6-3, 6-3, 4-6, 4-6, 6-3 victory over germany's alexander zverev. defending champion nadal, 35, who would have been the oldest finalist at the french open in the modern era, remains tied on 20 majors with roger federer. ""it was a privilege to face rafa in such an incredible match,"" said djokovic after four hours and 11 minutes of intense action. ""tonight it was my greatest ever match in paris. ""it was his second win in nine meetings at roland garros with nadal, a sequence which also included devastating losses in the 2012, 2014 and 2020 finals. ""definitely one of the top three matches that i ever played in my entire career,"" said djokovic. ""considering the quality of tennis, playing my biggest rival on the court where he has had so much success and has been the dominant force in the last 15-plus years, and the atmosphere which was completely electric.  just amazing. ""it was nadal's first defeat in 14 semi-finals in the french capital. ""probably it was not my best day today, even if i fought,"" said nadal. ""sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.  i had a big chance.  there were some crazy points but there was fatigue there. ""djokovic finished with 50 winners; nadal committed 55 unforced errors under a relentless assault. ""it's hard to find words bigger than all the superlatives you can think of for rafa's achievements in roland garros,"" added 34-year-old djokovic who now leads their series 30-28. ""each time you step on the court with him, you know that you have to kind of climb mount everest to win against this guy here. ""nadal bemoaned the humid conditions which became heavier and slower as the evening progressed. ""we had been playing with very warm and high bounces.  during the night the situation goes a little bit the other way,"" he said. ""so the bounce is a little less.  the ball gets less top-spin.  that's more favourable for him. ""djokovic had two break points in the opening game of the first set which stretched to 10 minutes but was unable to convert. curfew-buster -nadal made him pay, sprinting away for a 5-0 lead before the top seed got on the board. djokovic clung on, retrieving one break to get to 2-5 but nadal eventually prevailed after one hour on court even if he required seven set points to edge ahead. as a sign of the tension of the occasion, nadal complained to chair umpire eva asderaki-moore that he needed more time to collect his towel. djokovic aired his bemusement at the amount of clay on the baselines. the old rivals exchanged breaks in the second and third games of a big-hitting second set but it was djokovic who repeated the feat for a 4-2 lead before levelling the tie. twice in the third set djokovic edged ahead, only to be reeled back in by nadal who broke back in the 10th game as the world number one served for the set. djokovic then had to save a set point with an ice-cool drop shot in the 12th game. ""you cannot play better clay court tennis than this.  it's perfect,"" tweeted an admiring andy murray, the former world number one who lost the 2016 final to djokovic. the 92-minute third set ended with djokovic taking the tiebreak. in a further twist on a dramatic evening, the 5,000 spectators inside court philippe chatrier were allowed to watch the conclusion of the match despite it passing the 11pm covid-19 curfew. ""in agreement with the national authorities, the match will come to an end in your presence,"" said a stadium announcer told delighted fans. nadal broke in the first game of the fourth set but djokovic levelled for 2-2 and broke again for 4-2. he finished it off on a second match point when nadal hit wide and long. dj/jcchina's quick rollout of a law against foreign sanctions has left european and american companies shocked and facing ""irreconcilable"" compliance issues, two top business groups said friday, despite beijing saying the move would unlikely impact investment. it is compulsory to have your car insured in singapore.  why not make the most of it by looking for the best car insurance plan in town when your policy is up for renewal? while it can be tempting to simply renew your existing car [. . . ] the post 5 best car insurance plans in singapore (2021) appeared first on singsaver blog we compare, you save. få flere penge i hverdagen ved at samle din gæld.  indsend en ansøgning her og få et tilbud.  indfri lånet når du ønsker det. a 24-year-old man who was seen naked in public in several photos and videos circulating online has been arrested by the police. second minister for education maliki osman has taken to facebook to express his shock and disappointment at alleged islamophobic remarks made by a ngee ann polytechnic (np) lecturer. newly-crowned french open champion barbora krejcikova hailed her mentor and former wimbledon champion jana novotna who died in 2017, saying: ""at the end of her life, i had to be there.

2021-06-13,Nearly two thirds of Brazilians oppose hosting Copa America amid pandemic.,"rio de janeiro:     nearly two thirds of brazilians oppose the country hosting the upcoming copa america soccer tournament, a poll showed on friday, amid concerns over the country's dire covid-19 outbreak. the south american football confederation last week unexpectedly relocated the tournament, which kicks off on sunday, with brazilian president jair bolsonaro's backing. brazil stepped up after co-hosts colombia were dropped because of civil unrest and argentina withdrew after a surge in coronavirus infections. bolsonaro has played down the severity of the pandemic and fought against lockdowns to control an outbreak that has killed more than 480,000 brazilians.  public health experts, supreme court justices and footballers questioned the wisdom of hosting the tournament with a pandemic raging, while high-profile sponsors have pulled out. according to an xp/ipespe poll, 64per cent of respondents were against hosting the cup, while 29per cent were in favor.  among bolsonaro's critics, 83per cent were against the tournament in brazil, while 35per cent of his supporters also did not support the competition. ahead of next year's elections, former leftist president luiz inacio lula da silva appears to be strengthening his lead over bolsonaro, the poll showed.  although neither men have announced their candidacy, the 2022 election is widely expected to be a run-off between the two polarizing figures. in the first round vote, lula saw his share rise to 32per cent, up three percentage points from a may poll.  bolsonaro's first-round support slipped one percentage point to 28per cent.  in a simulated second-round matchup, lula's support rose to 45per cent from 42per cent in the previous survey, while bolsonaro's fell to 36per cent from 40per cent. the poll was based on 1,000 interviews, conducted from june 7-10, with a margin of error of 3. 2 percentage points.

""now we don't have to juggle such small numbers.  we can carry out lessons with four swimmers to one coach.  that ratio is a huge difference to us because when it's one-to-one, we're definitely losing money. ""the multi-ministry task force on thursday had indicated that mass participatory sports events such as runs could also be allowed to resume from june 21, with a maximum of 250 participants if pre-event testing is implemented. if participants are not tested before the event, only 50 people will be allowed to take part. national agency sportsg's latest update permitting sports competitions as long as different sessions are adequately separated within a day or across multiple days to avoid congregation was welcomed by organisers like lld sports development and management founder lyn yeo. her company is hoping to get approval for the cartimes singapore junior development tour championship.  the golf event at laguna national was postponed from its original may 31-june 2 date. she said: ""june is typically the busiest tournament season for junior golfers and we are hoping with great excitement that we are able to resume. ""some measures that organisers plan to have in place include temperature screening and safe entry protocols, as well as restricting each flight to two buggies, which have been installed with a full partition. players and officials will also be required to wear masks throughout their rounds. for gyms and fitness studios, many of whom are closed due to current restrictions, they will be allowed to restart operations from june 21. staff from these places where clients are unmasked will be required to undergo regular covid-19 testing, which is part of the regular fast and easy testing regimen for staff involved in ""higher-risk mask-off"" activities.  this will be introduced in july to reduce transmission during phase three (heightened alert). sportsg also announced that the occupancy limit for sport and recreational facilities will be increased to one person per 10 sq m from one person per 16 sq m, capped at 50 people. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-13,Israel's Netanyahu poised to lose power to new government.,"israel's parliament is expected to approve the formation of a new government later on sunday, ending 12 years of rule by pm benjamin netanyahu. the prospective government an unprecedented coalition of parties has a razor-thin majority of one seat. it would also end more than two years of political paralysis in which three elections resulted in stalemate. right-wing nationalist naftali bennett is poised to become pm in a power-sharing deal with a centrist leader. under the coalition agreement, mr bennett, who heads the yamina party, will hold office until september 2023, when he will hand over to yair lapid, leader of yesh atid, for a further two years. mr netanyahu israel's longest-serving leader, who has dominated its political landscape for years would remain head of the right-wing likud party and become leader of the opposition.  he has railed against the likely new government, calling it a ""dangerous coalition of fraud and surrender"" and has vowed to ""overthrow it very quickly"". meanwhile, his trial on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust allegations he denies continues. mr netanyahu has served a record-breaking five terms, first from 1996 to 1999, then continuously from 2009 to 2021. he called an election in april 2019 but failed to win enough support to form a new coalition government.  two more elections followed, each of which ended inconclusively.  the third election resulted in a government of national unity where mr netanyahu agreed to share power with the then-opposition leader benny gantz.  but the arrangement collapsed in december, triggering a fourth election. although likud emerged as the largest party in the 120-seat parliament, mr netanyahu was again unable to form a governing coalition and the task was handed to mr lapid, whose party had emerged as the second largest.  opposition to mr netanyahu staying in power had grown, not just among the left and centre but also among right-wing parties that are ordinarily ideologically aligned to likud, including yamina. although yamina came joint fifth in the election with only seven seats, its support was critical if any potential coalition government was to have a majority in parliament.  after weeks of negotiations, mr lapid brought yamina on board as part of a constellation of parties whose only common goal was to remove mr netanyahu from office. the agreement involving eight factions with the 61 seats required for a majority was signed on 2 june, just half an hour before a deadline was due to expire, effectively sealing mr netanyahu's fate. in appearance, mr bennett's government would be unlike any which has preceded it in israel's 73-year history.  the alliance contains parties which have vast ideological differences, and perhaps most significantly includes the first independent arab party to be part of a potential ruling coalition, raam.  it is also expected to have a record number of eight female ministers. the inclusion of raam and left-wing non-arab israeli parties means there could be friction on issues such as israeli policies towards palestinians yamina and another right-wing party, new hope, are staunch supporters of jewish settlement in the israeli-occupied west bank, for instance.  there could also be difficulties over social policies while some parties want to advance gay rights, such as recognising same sex marriages, raam, an islamist party, is against this.  in addition, some parties want to relax religious restrictions more extensively than yamina a national-religious party will likely allow. mr bennett has indicated his government would focus on areas where agreement was possible, like economic issues or the coronavirus pandemic, while avoiding more contentious matters. ""nobody will have to give up their ideology,"" he recently said, ""but all will have to postpone the realisation of some of their dreams. . .  we'll focus on what can be achieved, rather than arguing about what cannot.

															reutersst petersburg: romelu lukaku struck twice as belgium confirmed their status as one of the favourites for euro 2020 with a confident 3-0 victory over russia on saturday. despite being without key performer kevin de bruyne, world number one ranked belgium were rarely in trouble against a russia side that struggled to impose themselves. roberto martinez's belgium top group b on three points, ahead on goal difference of finland who beat denmark in the group's other game in copenhagen. the red devils are unbeaten in 10 games in all competitions and have suffered just one defeat in their last 24 outings.  they have also scored in each of their last 31 games. the visitor's grabbed the lead in the 10th minute when andrei semyonov failed to deal with a ball into the box from leander dendoncker, and lukaku turned and fired into the bottom corner. lukaku celebrated his goal by running to the television camera and shouting ""chris, chris, i love you"" in tribute to christian eriksen, the danish midfielder and his club team-mate at inter milan, who had been rushed to hospital after collapsing during the earlier game in the group. belgium were calm in possession and finding plenty of time and space against a russia side who struggled to get a firm grip on the game. the russians reached the quarter-finals in the world cup they hosted in 2018 but the energy of those performances was missing, despite playing at home in front of more than 26,000 fans. stanislav cherchesov struggled to find either the tempo to their attacks or a way to provide quality service to striker artem dzyuba who was too often left isolated. it was no surprise when the second goal came, in the 34th minute, when russia keeper anton shunin could only parry thorgan hazard's shot towards thomas meunier, who made no mistake. russia applied some pressure after the interval but the beligans coped without too much panic and the game already felt decided before lukaku wrapped up the win with a well-taken effort after racing on to a through ball from meunier. lukaku said the eriksen situation had left him in tears before the game. ""i cried a lot because i was scared, obviously.  you live strong moments together.  i spent more time with him than with my family,"" he said. ""my thoughts are with him, his girlfriend, his two kids and his family,"" he added. ""i enjoyed the game but for me, it was difficult to play because my mind was with christian.  i hope he is healthy and i dedicate this performance to him,"" added the former manchester united striker. cherchesov conceded his team had struggled after falling behind to lukaku's opener. ""our tournament is continuing.  we are doing our job.  we chose our system, it worked partly but then started to break down.  the belgians scored and then it was difficult to get the ball off them. ""the russians host finland on wednesday and will need to quickly get their campaign on track. ""we will get out of the situation.  we put ourselves there, so we must now get out of it,"" cherchesov added. lukaku and the belgian team had taken the knee before the kick-off but the anti-racist gesture was met with jeers and whistles from the crowd. heavy to very heavy rain is expected in the north and northeast of thailand on sunday due to tropical storm ""koguma"", the thai meteorological department announced in its 5am weather bulletin. paris: after flying into the financial turbulence of the covid pandemic, the airline sector expects passenger traffic to take off despite concerns about the industry's impact on climate change. most thais lack confidence in govt's handling of covid crisis and see political meddling in vaccine distribution, says nida poll.

2021-06-13,Soccer-Mancini's calls pay off as 'perfect' Italy make Euro 2020 statement.,"rome:     roberto mancini might be laughing now, but the italy coach will not find it so easy to play down his team's chances of winning euro 2020 if they continue like they started. the azzurri put in a dominant, swashbuckling display as they flattened turkey 3-0 in rome's stadio olimpico on friday to start their campaign in style. the victory marked their 28th consecutive game without defeat, leaving mancini two games away from equalling double world cup winning manager vittorio pozzo's all-time unbeaten record from the 1930s. but when asked if his side were now among the tournament favourites, mancini laughed. ""it was important to start well here in rome and i think we satisfied everyone, for the fans and all the italians watching.  (but) there are six games to go and there are a lot of good teams,"" he said. the second part of mancini's answer showed that while he does not want his players to face the pressure that comes with being favourites, his ambition is nevertheless to reach the final in six games' time. that does not seem like an unlikely proposition after an opening day performance that could not have gone much better, as all of mancini's big selection decisions paid off. ""italy were almost perfect, dominating possession and creating a lot of chances without ever leaving themselves at risk,"" 2006 world cup winner alessandro del piero told sky italia. the question of who should lead the line has long been a cause of debate in italy, but lazio striker ciro immobile answered his critics in his club's home stadium by scoring his first major tournament goal before setting up lorenzo insigne for italy's third. leonardo spinazzola's selection at left back ahead of chelsea's emerson proved to be a great call as the as roma man also shone on a familiar pitch, earning the man of the match award after terrorising the turks' right flank for 90 minutes. domenico berardi was preferred to federico chiesa on the right wing and was heavily involved; his awkward cross led to merih demiral's own goal to calm any italian nerves. by fulltime, the azzurri had scored three goals in a european championship match for the first time and all of mancini's decisions were justified. it was a magical night for the italians present in the 16,000-strong crowd, and the anger and disappointment of the failure to qualify for the 2018 world cup is now a distant memory. based on the opening day evidence, mancini will not be able to laugh off italy's title-winning credentials for long.

2021-06-13,Taiwan president's ex-bodyguards sentenced in smuggling case.,"a taiwanese court on friday handed prison terms to a dozen former presidential security agents and airline employees over their roles in a cigarette smuggling scandal on the island two years ago. a bodyguard in president tsai ing-wen's entourage tried to bring in 9,800 cigarette cartons as he returned from an official trip accompanying tsai to the caribbean. the president said at the time that she had no idea her security team was involved and ordered an investigation. the agent, identified as wu tsung-hsien of the national security bureau, received the heaviest sentence of 10 years and four months on corruption and tax evasion charges, according to taipei district court. wu tried to pass the cigarettes off as cargo from tsai's presidential plane in an effort to smuggle them past customs, authorities said. it was later discovered that the scam was not a one-off when china airlines released figures showing huge amounts of duty-free cigarettes were routinely purchased during presidential visits. the defendants ""deprived the government of tax revenue, and seriously damaged the nation's image"", judge huang pei-chen told a virtual press conference. the value of duty evaded on the cigarettes amounted to nearly tw$8. 2 million ($273,000), according to the court. wu's colleague and main accomplice chang heng-chia was sentenced to 10 years and two months while six other ex-agents received jail terms ranging from six years and two months to seven years. four airline employees implicated in the scandal were handed prison terms ranging from two years to five years and four months. they can appeal the ruling. the bureau's internal investigation found that most agents bought a few dozen cartons of cigarettes into the island on the trip -- the majority ordering between 11 and 50 cartons. around 100 others involved in presidential security who have bought cigarettes into taiwan reached deferred prosecution agreements in 2019 and last year. taiwan's customs law limits travellers to a maximum of five cartons of cigarettes -- and only one can be tax-free. aw/axnchina's quick rollout of a law against foreign sanctions has left european and american companies shocked and facing ""irreconcilable"" compliance issues, two top business groups said friday, despite beijing saying the move would unlikely impact investment. the ministry of health (moh) on friday (11 june) confirmed nine new covid-19 cases in singapore, bringing the country's total case count to 62,245. få flere penge i hverdagen ved at samle din gæld.  indsend en ansøgning her og få et tilbud.  indfri lånet når du ønsker det. it is compulsory to have your car insured in singapore.  why not make the most of it by looking for the best car insurance plan in town when your policy is up for renewal? while it can be tempting to simply renew your existing car [. . . ] the post 5 best car insurance plans in singapore (2021) appeared first on singsaver blog we compare, you save. second minister for education maliki osman has taken to facebook to express his shock and disappointment at alleged islamophobic remarks made by a ngee ann polytechnic (np) lecturer. a 24-year-old man who was seen naked in public in several photos and videos circulating online has been arrested by the police. kia proceed er den frække familiebil, der imponerer med klassens måske flotteste design, rå kraft og en lang udstyrsliste. what if china were to cut off the united states and europe from access to rare minerals that are essential to electric vehicles, wind turbines and drones?newly-crowned french open champion barbora krejcikova hailed her mentor and former wimbledon champion jana novotna who died in 2017, saying: ""at the end of her life, i had to be there.

2021-06-13,Risk of heart inflammation after second dose of mRNA Covid-19 vaccine “very small”: S’pore expert committee.,"they occur more often in men compared to women. authordatecategorysingapore – according to the expert committee on covid-19 vaccination in singapore, there is a ""very small risk"" of heart inflammation after receiving the second dose of an mrna covid-19 vaccine; however, the ""benefits continue to outweigh the risks. ""the expert committee is closely monitoring international reports regarding the second dose of an mrna covid-19 vaccine being associated with a small risk of myocarditis and pericarditis in young men, said the ministry of health (moh) in a media release on friday (jun 11). myocarditis and pericarditis are inflammatory conditions affecting the heart muscles and the outer lining of the heart, respectively. they occur more often in men compared to women.  patients have shown symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or abnormal heartbeats, said moh. although most cases are mild, with patients recovering without the need for significant intervention and do not suffer long-term effects, ""very rarely severe cases may result in damage to the heart. ""increased occurrences of myocarditis and pericarditis after the second dose of mrna covid-19 vaccinations have been observed overseas in israel and the united states (us) in young men below the age of 25 years. the risk of this has been estimated to be 1. 6 cases per 100,000 doses for mrna vaccines in the us, which is comparable to the risk of anaphylaxis observed in singapore. locally, the health sciences authority (hsa) has reported four cases involving young men aged between 18 to 30 years. moh noted that the incidents occurred at the upper end of the expected range for the age group.  most of the cases were reported within a few days after receiving the second dose of the vaccine. all of the men have recovered or been discharged well from the hospital. myocarditis and pericarditis are separate and distinct conditions from heart attacks caused when blood flow to the heart is blocked. ""we have reviewed the currently available international and local data,"" said moh. ""our assessment is that the benefits of receiving the mrna covid-19 vaccines, i. e. , reduction in covid-19 infections and severe complications even if infected, continue to outweigh the risks of vaccination. ""as a precaution, adolescents and younger men, in particular, should avoid strenuous physical activity for one week after their second dose. ""during this time, they should seek medical attention promptly if they develop chest pain, shortness of breath, or abnormal heartbeats,"" advised the expert committee. /tisgread related: about 2,000
