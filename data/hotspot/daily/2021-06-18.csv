                singapore (the straits times/ann): sales of self-administered covid-19 test kits started at all major pharmacies in singapore on wednesday (june 16). all 79 guardian pharmacy stores islandwide have been stocked with two antigen rapid test (art) kits: the abbott panbiotm covid-19 antigen self-test and the quickvue at-home otc covid-19 test. a guardian spokesman said: ""both brands are approved by the health sciences authority (hsa).  the instructions on how to use these two brands differ, hence customers are advised to follow the specific instruction leaflet carefully for the brand they purchase. ""the same two test kits are also available at watsons singapore and unity stores. their retail prices range from s$10 to $13 per test kit, as recommended by the ministry of health (moh). the abbott panbio test kit costs $13 at guardian.  the same kit costs $12. 80 at unity and $13. 10 at watsons.  it is cheaper to purchase the tests in boxes of 10 or more. there were few buyers for the test kits when the straits times checked guardian, watsons and unity pharmacy outlets in jurong east, bukit panjang, potong pasir and toa payoh on wednesday morning (june 16). retiree j.  brown, 60, visited a watsons pharmacy at bukit panjang plaza on wednesday to purchase covid-19 test kits for her family as they are returning to britain in september this year. ""instead of going all the way (to the test centre), it's easier and more convenient if you have the kits,"" said brown, whose husband works in the oil and gas industry and whose daughter works in a school.  ""we can test ourselves one to two weeks before we leave so that we can avoid problems when we go to the airport.  at least you know that you are 90 per cent negative. ""eric lim, 33, who works as a kitchen staff at a japanese restaurant, said he plans to buy three kits next month.  he has planned a cruise trip to nowhere in that month. ""i plan to use one kit to test myself before i go on my trip and the other two to occasionally check on myself as my grandparents live with me.  i don't want to risk spreading anything to them,"" said lim. he told st he will buy more kits if he is able to use them with ease. jordan lim, 30, director of red ginger, said that he intends to purchase 150 sets of the test kits for his employees across his four eateries islandwide. he said it gives them the convenience of administering the test once every two weeks without having to go to a test centre. but he is concerned about the ongoing cost of testing, saying: ""purchasing the test kits will only add on to our operational cost.  with the current pandemic, our revenue has significantly decreased so we're unsure if we can absorb the costs of the testing kits in the long run. ""the self-administered testing kits are meant to make testing fast, easy and accessible as singapore gradually resumes more activities. the self-administered tests will allow moh to detect infected cases more quickly, in particular among asymptomatic individuals and those concerned that they might have been exposed to covid-19. sales across all pharmacies are currently limited to 10 art kits per person to ensure there are adequate supplies for all. the guardian spokesman said its pharmacies have sufficient stock to cater to the expected demand. ""the limit of 10 kits has been set to ensure sufficient stocks for everyone. . .  our pharmacists will exercise discretion with regards to the sale of test kits and we will encourage customers to shop safely and purchase only what they need,"" she said.  ""we will continue to closely monitor the situation and adapt our measures where needed. ""individuals who have a positive result for their art self-test should immediately approach a swab and send home public health preparedness clinic for a confirmatory polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test, moh said. they are then required to self-isolate until they receive a negative pcr test result. meanwhile, those who test negative on their self-test art should still stay vigilant and adhere to prevailing safe management measures. individuals who have acute respiratory infection symptoms have also been urged to visit a doctor for a full diagnosis and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test instead of relying on an art self-test kit. the hsa has also noted that arts have a lower sensitivity than pcr tests and a higher chance of false negative results.  in general, arts can achieve a sensitivity of about 80 per cent for cases with higher viral loads and a specificity range of 97 per cent to 100 per cent, it added. sensitivity refers to a test's ability to identify those infected as positive, while specificity refers to a test's ability to correctly identify those not infected as negative.  -- the straits times/ann

""the rate of decline in infections has slowed and because of the emergence of variants, there is a risk that cases may increase,"" prime minister yoshihide suga told a news conference.  ""given the circumstances, we need to be vigilant to ensure there is no rebound, and remain focused in implementing anti-virus measures. ""japan's emergency measures have been far less strict than the lockdowns and circuit breakers overseas.  museums, gyms, shopping malls, cinemas and theatres are among those that remain open with few restrictions, and there is no compulsory location check-ins nor pre-event testing. but tokyo and osaka have been under either a covid-19 emergency or ""quasi-emergency"" for all but four weeks so far this year, and public patience is fast wearing thin. they will not get any respite, however, with the ""quasi-emergency"" said to be necessary for the authorities to curb movement to prevent a spike in cases as the clock ticks down on the olympic games. an 8pm curfew on dine-in service at eateries will remain under ""quasi-emergency"" areas, though a blanket ban on alcohol sales will be relaxed to allow such sales until 7pm for parties of up to two people. but fines of up to 300,000 yen (s$3,640) on non-compliant eateries are being seen as a slap on the wrist by those who are flouting the guidelines to satiate public demand, and to stay afloat amid the slow disbursement of grants for compliance. mr suga's vow to achieve a 70 per cent reduction in people making the daily commute to work has also come to naught with more companies mandating in-person attendance.  parks and other public spaces are packed, with little to differentiate from normalcy beyond masks and curfews. a study by the national institute of infectious diseases released on wednesday suggested that the latest emergency has shown ""little statistical effect"" in tokyo.   still, mr suga said: ""we must ask you to continue these restrictions and i hate to do this, but in order to regain normalcy in our lives, i need to ask for your understanding and cooperation. ""he added that his persistence on the olympic games was not an issue of ""personal pride or the economy"". ""mankind has faced the daunting challenge of covid-19, and now is the time to unite and show the world hat we can overcome this difficulty through the efforts and wisdom of the people,"" he said. japan reported a total of 1,554 cases on thursday, down from the fourth-wave peak of 7,234 cases on may 8.  this was led by 452 cases in tokyo, 185 in kanagawa and 124 in chiba.  okinawa logged 97 cases, while there were 99 in aichi and 95 in osaka.  join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright Â© 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-17,Israel strikes Gaza in response to incendiary balloons.,"gaza city: israel carried out air strikes on the gaza strip early on wednesday (jun 16) after militants in the palestinian territory sent incendiary balloons into the south of the country, in the first major conflict between the two sides since a flare-up in may in which hundreds were killed. the strikes were the first under the new coalition government headed by naftali bennett, whotook over on sundayafter ousting former prime minister benjamin netanyahu. and they come as more than a thousand ultranationalist demonstrators bearing israeli flags poured into jerusalem's flashpoint old city on tuesday, with scores of police deployed and international monitors urging calm. according to palestinian sources, israel's air force targeted at least one site east of khan yunis in the south of the gaza strip, which is home to about two million people. an afp photojournalist in khan yunis saw the explosions. the israeli defence force said that in response to the ""arson balloons"", its ""fighter jets struck military compounds belonging to the hamas terror organisation"". it added that ""facilities and meeting sites for terror operatives"" in khan yunis were targeted.  there was no indication of casualties so far. local firefighters said the incendiary balloons caused around 20 fires in southern israel. the violence marks the first major flare-up between israel and palestinian militants since a ceasefire came into place in may, ending 11 days of heavy fighting that killed 260 palestinians, according to gaza authorities, and 13 people in israel, the police and army there said. restraintin annexed east jerusalem, more than one thousand people took to the streets in a delayed and controversial march by nationalist and far-right activists. the us and un had called for restraint before the march, which bennett's new administration had authorised. with tensions high, israeli police were deployed in heavy numbers, blocking roads and firing stun grenades and foam-tipped bullets to remove palestinians from the main route. medics said 33 palestinians were wounded and police said two officers were injured and 17 people arrested. the demonstration triggered protests in the west bank and gaza strip and prompted rebukes and warnings from israel's allies. the so-called march of the flags celebrates the anniversary of the city's ""reunification"" after israel captured east jerusalem from jordan in 1967 and annexed it, a move not recognised by most of the international community. tuesday's demonstration was originally scheduled for early may but cancelled twice amid police opposition and threats from hamas, the islamist group that controls the palestinian enclave of gaza. throngs of mostly young religious men sang, danced and waved flags at the damascus gate entrance to the old city that was cleared of its usual palestinian crowds. some chanted ""death to arabs"" before others quieted them. 'provocation'the march comes just two days after netanyahu was ousted after 12 straight years in power, toppled by an ideologically divided coalition including, for the first time in israel's history, an arab party. bennett is himself a jewish nationalist but netanyahu's allies accused the new premier of treachery for allying with arabs and the left. some demonstrators on tuesday carried signs reading ""bennett the liar"". yair lapid, the architect of the new government, tweeted he believed the march had to be allowed but that ""it's inconceivable how you can hold an israeli flag and shout, 'death to arabs' at the same time. ""mansour abbas, whose four-seat raam islamic party was vital to the coalition, called tuesday's march a ""provocation"" that should have been cancelled. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-17,Denmark set for 'emotional Belgium game as Dutch target Euro 2020 knockouts.,"published :
													17 jun 2021 at 18:45												writer: 
															afp paris denmark host the world's top-ranked side belgium at euro 2020 on thursday with the trauma of christian eriksen's collapse still raw, while the netherlands can move into the last 16 on their return to a major tournament. five days after eriksen required emergency medical treatment to revive him at copenhagen's parken stadium, denmark play group b leaders belgium looking to move on from a harrowing 1-0 defeat by finland. ""it will be very emotional to return to the parken, we expect to have incredible support from our fans and from the whole country,"" said denmark coach kasper hjulmand. ""we have to be ready for that and use this energy in a positive way. ""denmark fans will stage a minute's applause in the 10th minute in support of eriksen. ""what's crazy is that the hospital where christian is staying is not far from the stadium.  he can see the stadium and he might even be able to hear everything that is happening there,"" added hjulmand. the 29-year-old eriksen is to be fitted with a defibrillator after suffering a cardiac arrest during his team's opening game. ""after christian has been through different heart examinations it has been decided that he should have an icd (heart starter),"" the danish football federation announced ahead of thursday's 1600gmt kick-off. belgium striker romelu lukaku, who scored twice in their 3-0 win over russia and shouted a message of support to eriksen into a pitchside camera, said the players would kick the ball out of play for the minute's applause.

2021-06-17,China mourns passing of heroic pig that survived 2008 quake.,"shanghai: a pig that became an unlikely national icon in china after surviving 36 days under rubble from a powerful 2008 earthquake has died at the age of 14, sparking an outpouring of emotion on thursday (jun 17). ""zhu jianqiang"", or ""strong pig"", shot to fame after being discovered alive after the 7. 9-magnitude earthquake in south-western sichuan province on may 12, 2008. the earthquake left nearly 90,000 people dead or missing, and the pig's miraculous story, subsisting on a bag of charcoal and rainwater, was hailed as an inspiring symbol of the will to survive. witnesses said that the young zhu jianqiang had lost so much weight by the time it was pulled from the rubble that it looked more like a goat. a local museum near the city of chengdu had purchased the famous pig for 3,008 yuan (us$450) and kept it as a tourist attraction while it lived out its days. it succumbed to ""old age and exhaustion"" on wednesday night, the museum said on china's twitter-like weibo platform. in human terms, it was 100 years old, the global times said, citing its breeder. the celebrity porker was named china's animal of the year in 2008 because it ""vividly illustrated the spirit of never giving up"". the weibo hashtag ""strong pig died"" had drawn nearly 300 million views by midday on thursday and was rising fast. weibo users hailed it as ""the most famous pig in history"".

2021-06-17,Japan ending Tokyo COVID-19 emergency one month before Olympics.,"tokyo: japan's government on thursday (jun 17) approved lifting tokyo's virus emergency just over a month before the olympics, but set new restrictions that could sharply limit fans at games events. the state of emergency in place in tokyo began in late april and largely limits bar and restaurant opening hours and bans them from selling alcohol. that measure will now end in the capital and eight other regions on jun 20, prime minister yoshihide suga announced.  it will stay in place in okinawa. ""the number of infections nationwide has been declining since mid-may and the situation in terms of hospital beds is steadily improving,"" he said. ""on the other hand, in some regions, there are signs that the fall in the number of infections is slowing,"" suga added. in place of the emergency, the government will implement so-called ""quasi-emergency"" measures in tokyo and six other areas until jul 11. the measures will slightly relax the rules on alcohol, allowing sales until 7pm, but still asks restaurants and bars to shut at 8pm. crucially, with just five weeks until the pandemic-postponed games open, tokyo is likely to maintain strict limits on the number of spectators allowed at large events. the current state of emergency allows only 5,000 people or 50 per cent of venue capacity, whichever is smaller. and on wednesday, the government approved an upper limit of 10,000 spectators for areas not under any restrictions. those rules are likely to guide olympic organisers when they decide in the coming days how many domestic fans, if any, will be allowed to attend. overseas fans have already been banned from the games for the first time, and organisers said they would wait to rule on domestic spectators until the emergency was lifted. the issue is controversial.  while cases in japan have fallen from their fourth wave peak, some medical professionals fear that crowds of olympic spectators could fan a new surge. a report expected soon from some of the government's top medical advisers will argue holding the games without fans would be safest, national broadcaster nhk said on thursday. the experts will urge that additional rules are imposed if spectators are allowed, nhk said. ""respond flexibly""suga noted that professional baseball and football games have continued with limited spectators throughout the emergency ""and there have been few clusters"". but he also warned that measures could be tightened if the situation worsens. ""if there are signs that the medical system is stretched because of another expansion (of infections), we will respond flexibly, including by reinforcing measures,"" he told a news conference. japan has seen a comparatively small virus outbreak, with slightly more than 14,000 deaths while avoiding harsh lockdowns. just over 6 per cent of the population is fully vaccinated so far. given the likely restrictions, olympic organisers have given up on selling any more tickets and are weighing a lottery system to determine which ticket-holders will be able to attend events, kyodo news agency reported. millions of tickets were sold in japan last year before the postponement, and while several hundred thousand applications for refunds were processed after the games were postponed, the number of ticket-holders is still likely to exceed any spectator caps at many events. with just over a month until the games open, organisers are attempting to build confidence that the biggest international event since the pandemic began will be safe for participants and the public. newly updated virus rulebooks released this week warn athletes they could be expelled from the games if they violate requirements like mask-wearing and daily testing. organisers say more than 80 per cent of athletes will be vaccinated and they will be barred from interacting with the japanese public. recent polls have suggested a slight shift in public opposition to holding the games, with more now in favour of it going ahead than cancelling it. previous surveys that offered postponement as an option tended to show most japanese preferred either another delay or cancellation. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-17,Dickson Yeo detained under ISA for trying to provide reports on Singapore for 'foreign state'.,"singapore: singaporean dickson yeo was detained under the internal security act (isa) on jan 29 for acting as a paid agent for a ""foreign state"", the internal security department (isd) said on tuesday (jun 15). while isd did not name the foreign state, yeo, 40, was last year sentenced to 14 months' prison in the us for spying for china against the us. isdarrested yeo after he was deported to singaporeon dec 30 last year after he served his sentence.  it interviewed him to establish if he had engaged in activities prejudicial to singapore's security. the department said on tuesday that yeo carried out intelligence activities against singapore from 2016 until his arrest in the us in 2019.  he was tasked to source for information and provide reports on issues of interest to his foreign handlers, including information relating to singapore. ""towards this end, he had approached various individuals in singapore in an attempt to obtain information for the purpose of writing his reports,"" isd said. yeo also set up a front company in singapore as a cover for his information-gathering activities as well as recruitment for his foreign handlers.  he also tried, but failed, to get a job in the singapore government. ""isd's investigations established that yeo had worked for the intelligence apparatus of a foreign state and had carried out various taskings given to him by his foreign handlers in exchange for monetary gains. ""yeo admitted to being fully aware that his foreign handlers were working for the intelligence apparatus of the foreign state. ""isd said investigations are ongoing and that yeo's ""continued detention is necessary to facilitate probes into the full extent of his activities"". yeo was jailed in the us on oct 9 last year after admitting to operating illegally as a foreign agent, which can bring up to 10 years in prison. he was given a relatively light sentence and credited for 11 months already spent in prison because of his cooperation with us authorities and the threat of contracting covid-19 in jail, a us federal judge said then. in his plea, yeo admitted to working between 2015 and 2019 for chinese intelligence, spotting and assessing americans with access to ""valuable non-public information"". they included a civilian working on the us air force's f-35b stealth fighter project, a pentagon army officer with afghanistan experience, and a state department official, all of whom were paid as much as us$2,000 to write reports for yeo. yeo told these people that the reports were for clients in asia, without revealing that they were in fact for the chinese government. yeo also told us investigators that his previous intelligence work targeted other asian countries before focusing on the us. mha said on jul 26 last year that its investigations into yeo's activities did not reveal any direct threat to singapore's security. recruited while studying at lkysppyeo was recruited by chinese intelligence operatives while studying for a phd at the national university of singapore's lee kuan yew school of public policy (lkyspp) in 2015, according to us court documents.  he went on to work for the chinese after he visited beijing to give a presentation on politics. former top singapore diplomat bilahari kausikan said that yeo's phd supervisor at lkyspp was huang jing.  the professor was identified in 2017 as an ""agent of influence for a foreign country"" by singapore's ministry of home affairs (mha). without naming the country, mha said huang ""knowingly interacted with intelligence organisations and agents of the foreign country, and cooperated with them to influence the singapore government's foreign policy and public opinion in singapore"". huang gave what he claimed was ""privileged information"" about the foreign country to prominent and influential singaporeans, including a senior member of lkyspp, with the aim of influencing their opinions in favour of that country, mha said. huang was permanently banned from singapore and had his permanent residency status revoked, mha said.  huang left singapore in 2017. lkyspp told cna on tuesday evening that it has strengthened ""oversight and risk-awareness procedures"" in relation to its education and research. ""we maintain an enhanced oversight on academic collaborations and partnerships, both local and overseas, and will also continue to keep a heightened awareness among all our staff and students on the risks of foreign interference,"" a spokesperson said. the past incidents involving a former staff member and student showed how different sectors of society, including education, could be potential targets for ""foreign subversion"", the spokesperson added. ""the school will not tolerate any acts or activities of foreign interference that threaten the country's national security or interests. ""on tuesday, isd said the singapore government takes a ""very serious view of anyone who enters into a clandestine relationship with a foreign government"". this includes those who engage in activities at the behest of the foreign power that may harm singapore's national security and interests, including bilateral relations, it said. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

mcdonald's is continuing its collaboration with pop-music phenomenon bts, adding new merchandise such as t-shirts and tote bags with images drawn by the band. the items set to go on sale tonight are part of the fast-food giant's marketing push for its bts meal and follow other bts-themed merchandise that sold swiftly after a may debut.  the new ""saucy collection,"" which includes t-shirts, tote bags and cushions, features personified mcdonald's menu options (think: ice cream cones with heart-sign hands) drawn by members of the k-pop supergroup.  the new ""melting collection"" features merchandise with pop art inspired by bts's hit song ""butter. ""
mcdonald's rolled out the meal in may, along with an initial lineup of merchandise that included hoodies, pajamas and bags featuring the band's logo and colors alongside the golden arches. the bts meal â 10 chicken mcnuggets, two special dipping sauces, fries and a coke â is being offered through june 20.  it is the latest meal inspired by celebrities' signature orders, following meals chosen and promoted by travis scott and j balvin.  the bts meal is the first such meal being sold in dozens of countries after the first two were sold last year in the u. s. 
specialty merchandise gives mcdonald's another way to strengthen its connections with the fans of the celebrities it partners with.  the new bts items will be priced between $12 and $110 when they go on sale through the weverse shop app tonight at 7 p. m.  edt. in this article:mike juang covers the world of ad tech for ad age.  he joined ad age after writing and producing at cnbc, cheddar and bloomberg, and holds a master's from nyu and from the university of edinburgh.

2021-06-17,"Delta variant of Covid-19 could have contributed to spread at S'pore's wet markets: Experts, Singapore News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore a wet market can fit a large number of people in a compact space and people have continued to flock to them even during the recent period of heightened alert. it is not surprising, therefore, that covid-19 cases have surfaced there, said experts. the increased number of cases recently might also be due to a variant of covid-19 that spreads more easily, they added. the cluster at 115 bukit merah view market and hawker centre is linked to 56 cases, said the ministry of health (moh) on thursday (june 17), making it the third-largest open cluster. precautions have also been taken at other wet markets after positive cases were found. stallholders at the nearby redhill market and food centre had to undergo mandatory covid-19 tests earlier this week. testing was also conducted for people working at the telok blangah drive food centre and market, which has been closed for disinfection till friday. associate professor alex cook, vice-dean of research at the national university of singapore's (nus) saw swee hock school of public health, said some wet markets may be quite compact relative to the number of visitors, which would heighten the risk of spread, even with natural ventilation. he noted that the recent wet market clusters have a mix of three types of cases: those who work in the market or at a stall, those who visit the market, and household contacts of a case connected to the market. the household contacts were not really infected because of the market per se, even though they are epidemiologically linked to the market clusters, he said. ""so the risk of infection within a wet market isn't quite as high as it may appear from the size of these clusters,"" he added. professor paul tambyah, president of the asia-pacific society of clinical microbiology and infection, said the spread in open-air wet markets suggests that airborne transmission is indeed rare as most authorities agree for all strains of the virus. as for whether wet markets should be avoided, he said: ""the key has to be vaccination.  that is how every single viral disease from smallpox to measles to polio has been controlled. ""a possible link has been established between the bukit merah and telok blangah markets. moh said on monday that a singaporean man, 42, who works as a hawker at the telok blangah food centre is a family member of another singaporean man, 47, who works as a cooking assistant at the bukit merah market. an infected person had also visited the redhill market and food centre from june 8 to 10, according to moh data. professor teo yik ying, dean of the nus' saw swee hock school of public health, said it is highly likely that the cases at the bukit merah and redhill markets are linked, given their proximity to each other. he added that malls and supermarkets have been where outbreaks were detected recently. ""i do not see them as a new weak link, but rather as a consequence of singapore having to deal with a much more infectious delta variant that is driving these outbreaks. ""recent evidence from britain has suggested that the delta variant has a reproductive number of five to eight, which is much higher than the wild-type variant that the world saw early last year, with an r0 of two to three, he said. the reproductive number, or r0, of a virus is a measure of its transmission, or the number of new infections generated by each case. an r0 rate of 1, for example, means on average each infected person will infect one other person they come in contact with. the moh told the straits times earlier this month that as at the end of may, 550 covid-19 cases in singapore were infected with the delta variant of the coronavirus first detected in india. the number included 428 local cases, and 122 imported ones. prof teo said the increased transmissibility of the delta variant means there is a possibility of a large outbreak event happening whenever infected cases are moving about in the community. ""if these cases were going to work or going about their social activities, then i expect the venues that are associated with the large outbreaks will be linked to workplaces or public spaces for social activities. ""but precisely because the default continues to be working from home and social activities are kept to a minimum now, people are frequenting malls, supermarkets, and wet markets for necessities and food.  this is why we are seeing outbreaks in such venues,"" he said. residents in telok blangah and bukit merah have expressed concern about the growing number of cases in the neighbourhood, as well as people who do not comply with safety rules. compliance officer gideon goh, 37, who lives in bukit merah, told the straits times that he had seen elderly people smoking or talking in groups in his neighbourhood, with masks that are not properly worn. mr goh, who recently reported such behaviour via the oneservice app, said: ""while we can report such non-compliant behaviour, if you want to avoid conflict, there's not very much that you can do apart from avoiding these people. ""he added: ""i think it also takes a little bit more of a community effort.  if there is a stronger sense of frowning upon certain behaviour by passers-by, then they know that they are in the minority and are more likely to follow the rules,"" he said. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright Â© 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

'it is not surprising, therefore, that covid-19 cases have surfaced there, said experts.', 'the increased number of cases recently might also be due to a variant of covid-19 that spreads more easily, they added.', 'the cluster at 115 bukit merah view market and hawker centre is linked to 56 cases, said the ministry of health (moh) on thursday (june 17), making it the third-largest open cluster.', 'precautions have also been taken at other wet markets after positive cases were found.', 'stallholders at the nearby redhill market and food centre had to undergo mandatory covid-19 tests earlier this week.', 'testing was also conducted for people working at the telok blangah drive food centre and market, which has been closed for disinfection till friday.', ""associate professor alex cook, vice-dean of research at the national university of singapore's (nus) saw swee hock school of public health, said some wet markets may be quite compact relative to the number of visitors, which would heighten the risk of spread, even with natural ventilation."", 'he noted that the recent wet market clusters have a mix of three types of cases: those who work in the market or at a stall, those who visit the market, and household contacts of a case connected to the market.', 'the household contacts were not really infected because of the market per se, even though they are epidemiologically linked to the market clusters, he said.', '""so the risk of infection within a wet market isn\'t quite as high as it may appear from the size of these clusters,"" he added.', 'professor paul tambyah, president of the asia-pacific society of clinical microbiology and infection, said the spread in open-air wet markets suggests that airborne transmission is indeed rare as most authorities agree for all strains of the virus.', 'as for whether wet markets should be avoided, he said: ""the key has to be vaccination.', 'that is how every single viral disease from smallpox to measles to polio has been controlled.', '""a possible link has been established between the bukit merah and telok blangah markets.', 'moh said on monday that a singaporean man, 42, who works as a hawker at the telok blangah food centre is a family member of another singaporean man, 47, who works as a cooking assistant at the bukit merah market.', 'an infected person had also visited the redhill market and food

redhill markets are linked, given their proximity to each other."", 'he added that malls and supermarkets have been where outbreaks were detected recently.', '""i do not see them as a new weak link, but rather as a consequence of singapore having to deal with a much more infectious delta variant that is driving these outbreaks.', '""recent evidence from britain has suggested that the delta variant has a reproductive number of five to eight, which is much higher than the wild-type variant that the world saw early last year, with an r0 of two to three, he said.', 'the reproductive number, or r0, of a virus is a measure of its transmission, or the number of new infections generated by each case.', 'an r0 rate of 1, for example, means on average each infected person will infect one other person they come in contact with.', 'the moh told the straits times earlier this month that as at the end of may, 550 covid-19 cases in singapore were infected with the delta variant of the coronavirus first detected in india.', 'the number included 428 local cases, and 122 imported ones.', 'prof teo said the increased transmissibility of the delta variant means there is a possibility of a large outbreak event happening whenever infected cases are moving about in the community.', '""if these cases were going to work or going about their social activities, then i expect the venues that

""his majesty expressed the opinion that a parliament sitting must be held as soon as possible. . .  parliament is an important platform for elected representatives to discuss various issues relating to the covid-19 pandemic,"" the palace said. his fellow sovereigns concurred, adding that they were of ""one mind"" that ""there is no need to place the nation under emergency rule after aug 1"". however, it is the king who has to assent or reject the government's advice on an emergency, and sultan abdullah was silent on the matter of an extension in his statement. it is not known if tan sri muhyiddin himself raised the issue in his audience with the king on tuesday or in previous meetings. nonetheless, a source close to one of the royal households noted ""the reason it's made that way is the issue (of an emergency) is not within the jurisdiction of the council of rulers, but the king"", hence the opinion is not expressed by sultan abdullah so that his discretion may be reserved. both the king and the other rulers also issued separate statements last october, when the government's initial request for an emergency was rejected. while sultan abdullah said such a decree was not necessary then, he called on politicians to ensure the passage of budget 2021 to ensure the nation's fight against covid-19 would not be undermined.  the other rulers, however, stressed on ""justice and limiting any element of abuse of power"". parliament last sat in december to narrowly approve this year's budget and mr muhyiddin's tenuous grip on a legislative majority has not been tested since, raising questions over his legitimacy. the emergency, which came into effect on jan 11, was imposed as malaysia struggled to contain the coronavirus outbreak after a spike in september. but critics say it has only entrenched the muhyiddin administration, whose parliamentary majority remains in doubt after a series of defections in both directions, as measures to tackle the disease did not require an emergency. the fact that may saw the most covid-19 deaths in a month has further fuelled the view that the emergency has not helped the fight against the pandemic. mr muhyiddin had on tuesday unveiled his national recovery plan, which outlines criteria in terms of daily infections, healthcare capacity and vaccination rates for the government to progressively loosen an ongoing lockdown. ""i pledge my commitment that the parliamentary session can convene. . .  around the months of september or october, subject to stringent sops (standard operating procedures),"" he had said. ""my stance from the very beginning has always been that the democratic parliamentary system should be able to function once again after the covid-19 cases are well under control and when we are close to achieving herd immunity. ""but both the king and his fellow rulers indicated the importance of ""a government that is stable and enjoys public confidence and support of the majority"". the royal statements have spurred opponents like umno president ahmad zahid hamidi, whose party wants to withdraw from government and force polls it believes will result in its return to dominance. ""umno supports and views seriously his majesty's call for the need to establish a stable and strong government that is capable of functioning effectively in addressing covid-19 and reviving the economy,"" he said in an immediate response. opposition leader anwar ibrahim said: ""i await the next step from the government led by muhyiddin yassin to call parliament as soon as possible.

""the polytechnic has officially charged the staff in question for serious breach of our staff code of conduct, and is proceeding to terminate his service,"" said an np spokesperson in a statement to cna on thursday (jun 17). the staff member is also accused of makingislamophobic remarksin class in 2017, according to an online post by an np alumna. ""we have completed our internal investigations for both incidents,"" the school said.  np said the school's staff members are ""expected to respect cultural, ethnic and religious differences in our society"". ""they must uphold secularity and impartiality at all times.  this is in line with our staff code of conduct which includes strict guidelines on personal and professional conduct,"" it added. ""the disciplinary action meted out against the staff in question reflects our commitment to provide a safe, inclusive and respectful environment for our campus community. ""np apologises to alumnain the statement, np also apologised to its alumna who alleged that the same staff member had made islamophobic remarks in class in 2017. ""when the incident came to our attention last week, we reached out to our alumna immediately to express our regret for her experience in 2017,"" said np, adding that the school immediately offered counselling support to her. ""we have since met her to get more details of her experience and would like to apologise for the distress that she suffered, and thank her for her assistance in our internal investigations,"" the spokesperson added. np added that police investigations were ongoing and that the school would fully cooperate with authorities. on jun 9, ms nurul fatimah iskandar shared her account on instagram and facebook of comments made about islam by her then-lecturer tan boon lee in class in 2017.  in her post, ms nurul also said she had made a complaint against the lecturer, but nothing happened after that. ""as part of our investigations, we also wanted to understand why our alumna's feedback had not been acted upon, to tighten our feedback processes and ensure that gaps and areas of improvement are duly addressed,"" said np. ""in our conversation with her, she indicated that she could not recall whether she had emailed her feedback on the incident or raised it during a post-course focus group discussion (fgds) in 2017. ""fgds are typically held at the end of every semester to seek students' feedback on courses and lecturers,"" the polytechnic said. np added that it has conducted a search of its various feedback channels, and worked with the alumna for her to check her np mailbox archives, but have not been able to locate any records of the feedback. ""nonetheless, we are committed to preventing a similar incident from occurring again, and will ensure that students are made aware of the appropriate channels for them to provide feedback in a safe manner,"" it said. ""we will also advise our staff on how to manage and report feedback that they may receive outside of these channels, as appropriate. ""np suspended the staff member from teaching duties on jun 7 after a video of him making racist remarks towards an interracial couple surfaced online.  the police said at the time that a 60-year-old man was assisting with investigations. in its statement, the school said that it has various channels for students to provide anonymous feedback, including a whistle-blowing email channel for students. ""other channels for student feedback include a general enquiry asknp email, course experience dialogues as well as various student surveys conducted periodically,"" said np. ""in addition, students can share their feedback with their staff advisors at any time.  we would like to assure students that all feedback will be taken seriously and handled in confidence. ""np added that moving forward, it will make all feedback channels more accessible and visible on its website, and publicise them on campus digital screens as well. ""we will review our internal feedback monitoring processes to identify and resolve any gaps in teaching and learning practices and to ensure that matters of concern can be flagged in a timely manner,"" said np.

2021-06-17,"Shenzhou-12: Chinese astronauts board space station module in historic mission, East Asia News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. jiuquan, china (reuters, afp, xinhua) three chinese astronauts on thursday (june 17) flew to an unfinished space station in china's first crewed mission since 2016, expanding the country's already growing near-earth presence and challenging us leadership in orbital space. the astronauts rode to tianhe â the module that will be the living quarters of china's completed space station â on shenzhou-12, or ""divine vessel"".  the crew boarded the module, where they will live for three months, the longest stay in low-earth orbit by any chinese national. china's space station, due to be finished by end-2022, will be the only alternative to the two-decade-old, us-led international space station (iss), which may be retired in 2024. if the iss â backed mainly by the united states, russia, japan, europe and canada â is decommissioned, china would be the operator of the only active space station. that would potentially give it greater power in shaping future norms and regulations for near-earth space, which is already teeming with chinese satellites. ""at this current stage, we haven't considered the participation of international astronauts, but their future participation will be guaranteed,"" said dr zhou jianping, chief designer of china's manned space programme. ""i'm aware that many countries have expressed their wish in this regard,"" dr zhou told foreign reporters at the shenzhou launch site in northwestern gansu province. shenzhou-12 is the third of 11 missions â four of which will be crewed â needed to complete china's first full-fledged space station.  construction began in april with the launch of tianhe, the first and largest of three modules. barred by us law from working with nasa and by extension on the iss, china has spent the past decade developing technologies to build its own space station, in addition to planning missions to the moon, mars and other planets. china plans to allow hong kong astronauts to join future missions, dr zhou also said. the astronauts nie haisheng, 56, liu boming, 54, and tang hongbo, 45, are to work and stay on tianhe, the living quarters of the future space station, for three months the longest stay in low earth orbit by any chinese national. during their sojourn on the cylinder-like tianhe, slightly bigger than a city bus, the three men will test the module's technologies, including its life-support system. the men will also be monitored for how they fare in space physically and psychologically for an extended period of time. an upcoming mission to the space station will last six months. ""this will be the first crewed flight in the space station (construction) phase, and i'm lucky to be able to have the 'first baton',"" mr nie told reporters in jiuquan a day before the launch. the veteran astronaut has been hailed by his team as a bastion of stability and a teacher figure who constantly challenges others with tough questions. ""as long as we have him in our hearts, we have nothing to fear,"" fellow astronaut wang yaping, who is part of the shenzhou-12 backup team, told state media previously. ""in our crew, elder brother nie is like the needle that stills the sea,"" she said. like mr nie, mr liu was from the first batch of astronauts selected in the 1990s for china's space programme. known for his intellect, mr liu is often addressed by his colleagues as ""little zhuge"", the renowned military strategist who lived in china two millennia ago. on the shenzhou-7 mission in 2008, mr liu famously used a crowbar to prise open the hatch after it refused to open. mr tang, a former air force pilot, 45, was from a later batch of astronauts, and trained for more than a decade before being selected for his first spaceflight on shenzhou-12. ""i've waited for 11 years, and finally i'm ready, and i can contribute my strength,"" mr tang told reporters on wednesday. their shenzhou-12 spacecraft will dock with the tianhe main section of the space station, which was placed in orbit on april 29. the module has separate living spaces for each of them, a treadmill for exercise, and a communication centre for e-mails and video calls with ground control. it is china's first crewed mission in nearly five years. the launch represents a matter of huge prestige in china, as beijing prepares to mark the 100th anniversary of the ruling communist party on july 1 with a massive propaganda campaign. to prepare for the mission, the crew has undergone more than 6,000 hours of training, including hundreds of underwater somersaults in full space gear. the first crew will test and maintain the systems on board, conduct spacewalks and undertake scientific experiments. tiangong will be much smaller than the iss, and is expected to have a lifespan of at least 10 years. since 2003, china has launched six crewed missions and sent 11 astronauts into space, including mr zhai zhigang, who carried out china's first space walk ever on the 2008 shenzhou mission. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright Â© 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

""we need vaccination acceleration in order to achieve communal immunity, which we hope can stop the covid-19 spread,"" president joko widodo said while visiting a vaccination centre just outside the capital jakarta. widodo said he ordered his cabinet ministers and local governments to increase the number of people vaccinated each day to 1 million by next month.  he said indonesia is currently vaccinating half a million people a day. indonesia, the world's fourth-most populous country, aims to inoculate more than 181 million of its 270 million people by march 2022, but authorities have only fully vaccinated 11. 8 million people and partially vaccinated another 9. 6 million others. national covid-19 task force spokesman wiku adisasmito said the slow progress can be put down to the limited global vaccine supply, the unpreparedness of the national health system and vaccine hesitancy.  the government has received 92. 2 million vaccine doses so far. indonesia reported 12,624 new covid-19 infections on thursday, the biggest increase since jan 30, health ministry data showed.  another 277 fatalities were added to the death toll from the disease. the increase in cases has been blamed on travel during last month's eid al-fitr holiday as well as the arrival of new virus variants, such as the delta version first found in india. in jakarta, the number of hospital beds occupied has shot up to 75 per cent this week from 45 per cent last week, government data shows. the who in its situation report on thursday noted that indonesia's drastic increase in bed occupancy rates is a major concern and necessitates the implementation of stricter public health and social measures, including large-scale social restrictions. ""with increased transmission due to variants of concern, urgent action is needed to contain the situation in many provinces,"" it said. indonesian health officials say they've detected the delta variant in jakarta, central java and east java provinces.  they say they have spotted three of the four variants of concern flagged by the who. adisasmito said that a spike in coronavirus infections has been seen this week in jakarta, banten, west java, central java, yogyakarta and east java provinces.  all are located on java, the most populous of indonesia's more than 17,000 islands. indonesia has reported more than 1. 9 million covid-19 cases since the pandemic began, with more than 53,700 deaths, the highest toll in southeast asia.  those numbers are thought to be an undercount due to a lack of widespread testing. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-17,"Employment grows more than expected in Q1, but uncertainties weigh on recovery: MOM.","singapore: total employment in singapore grew by more than estimated in the first quarter of this year, but economic uncertainties and covid-19 restrictions are expected to weigh on the pace of labour market recovery in the second quarter, said the ministry of manpower (mom) on thursday (jun 17). according to final figures for the quarter, total employment â excluding migrant domestic workers â grew by 12,200. this is higher than the figure of 4,800 reported in preliminary estimates in april, when mom said that total employment grew for the first time after four consecutive quarters of decline. the improved figures were due to a higher-than-anticipated rise in resident employment of 23,700.  at the same time, the economy continued to shed foreign workers, with non-resident employment declining by 11,500.  however, the pace at which non-resident employment fell moderated from previous quarters. resident employment increases were broad-based across industries, led by information and communications, food and beverage services, health and social services, administrative and support services, public administration and education, as well as professional services. ""these are good signs, which we are happy to see.  however, our path to recovery will not be a straight road.  we will be met with some twists and potential roadblocks,"" said minister for manpower tan see leng. ""in fact, last month's tightened measures in phase 2 (heightened alert) is expected to lead to some kinks.  recovery is also expected to be more uneven across sectors than earlier expected. ""decline in foreign labour ""cyclical""speaking after a visit to the procter and gamble innovation centre, dr tan said that the outlook remains ""guarded"" due to covid-19 restrictions in phase 2 (heightened alert), which singapore is just emerging from. domestic sectors like retail and food and beverage in particular would be impacted by the restrictions, he noted.  dining-in at f&b outlets, which has stopped since may 16, was to resume from jun 21 under a two-step reopening plan.  but that timeline is being evaluated as more covid-19 cases have emerged. export-oriented sectors like manufacturing, however, are expected to do well, said dr tan: ""even though we are guarded, we are cautiously optimistic, because external sectors in terms of the exports . . .  i think we're still seeing quite a lot of good news coming on that front. ""mom said that seasonally adjusted unemployment rates continued to improve, but unemployment rates remained elevated in march.  the overall unemployment rate in march was 2. 9 per cent, with the resident unemployment rate dipping from 4. 1 per cent to 4 per cent, and the citizen unemployment rate at 4. 2 per cent. the resident long-term unemployment rate, referring to people who have been unemployed for more than six months, remained unchanged at 1. 1 per cent. on foreign workers, permanent secretary for manpower aubeck kam said that ongoing border restrictions continue to put ""significant pressure"" on foreign employment, but this was ""cyclical"" and not a structural phenomenon. ""we do expect the number of foreign workers to grow at some point.  the prolonged decline is really a function of the border restrictions, and will not be representative of the demands of the different sectors,"" he said, adding that the drop in foreign employment in q1 was across different sectors. mr kam said that the fall in foreign worker numbers also has some bearing on projections in the second quarter as the output in some sectors like construction, which is reliant on foreign labour, will be reduced. responding to a reporter's question on when border restrictions may be relaxed so firms can hire the foreign workers they need, dr tan said that this depends on many factors and a ""key variable"" is the covid-19 situation in the countries where the workers are from.  he added that there is a ""risk quota"" to determine the inflow of workers. ""it is a daily, weekly and monthly calibration and titration according to the risks of the imports from these countries, versus what we can deal (with) in terms of our healthcare facilities,"" he said. more job vacancies, fewer retrenchmentsthe number of job vacancies increased further to 68,400 in march and the rise was reported in all industries, said mom. in particular, job vacancies were seen in manufacturing (mainly in fabricated metal products, machinery & equipment and electronics), public administration and education, construction, information and communications, as well as financial services. the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed people improved from 0. 75 in december 2020 to 0. 96, or nearly one job vacancy for every unemployed person in march.  this is within the pre-pandemic range, which was 0. 82 to 1. 09 from 2018 to 2019, said mom. the number of retrenchments fell to 2,270, and the six-month re-entry rate among retrenched residents (66 per cent) rose in q1 this year for the second consecutive quarter. ""more than half of retrenchments which occurred in q1 2021 were due to restructuring and re-organisation, while retrenchments due to recession or downturn in industry made up a smaller proportion compared to a quarter ago,"" said mom. as business activities picked up, the number of employees who were placed on short work-weeks or temporarily laid off also halved from 8,710 in the fourth quarter of 2020 to 4,020 in the last quarter. however, the level remains high compared to pre-pandemic quarters, which averaged 740 in 2018 and 2019. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

12,200. this is higher than the figure of 4,800 reported in preliminary estimates in april, when mom said that total employment grew for the first time after four consecutive quarters of decline.', 'the improved figures were due to a higher-than-anticipated rise in resident employment of 23,700.  at the same time, the economy continued to shed foreign workers, with non-resident employment declining by 11,500.  however, the pace at which non-resident employment fell moderated from previous quarters.', 'resident employment increases were broad-based across industries, led by information and communications, food and beverage services, health and social services, administrative and support services, public administration and education, as well as professional services.', '""these are good signs, which we are happy to see.', 'however, our path to recovery will not be a straight road.', 'we will be met with some twists and potential roadblocks,"" said minister for manpower tan see leng.', '""in fact, last month\'s tightened measures in phase 2 (heightened alert) is expected to lead to some kinks.', 'recovery is also expected to be more uneven across sectors than earlier expected.', '""decline in foreign labour ""cyclical""speaking after a visit to the procter and gamble innovation centre, dr tan said that the outlook remains ""guarded"" due to covid-19 restrictions in phase 2 (heightened alert), which singapore is just emerging from.', 'domestic sectors like retail and food and beverage in particular would be impacted by the restrictions, he noted.', 'dining-in at f&b outlets, which has stopped since may 16, was to resume from jun 21 under a two-step reopening plan.', 'but that timeline is being evaluated as more covid-19 cases have emerged.', 'export-oriented sectors like manufacturing, however, are expected to do well, said dr tan: ""even though we are guarded, we are cautiously optimistic, because external sectors in terms of the exports .', '.', '.', ""i think we're still seeing quite a lot of good news coming on that front."", '""mom said that seasonally adjusted unemployment rates continued to improve, but unemployment rates remained elevated in march.', 'the overall unemployment rate in march was 2.', '9 per cent, with the resident unemployment rate dipping from 4.', '1 per cent to 4 per cent, and the citizen unemployment rate at 4.', '2 per cent.', 'the resident long-term unemployment rate, referring to people who have been unemployed for more than six months, remained unchanged at 1.', '1 per cent.', 'on foreign workers, permanent secretary for manpower aubeck kam said that ongoing border restrictions continue to put ""significant pressure"" on foreign employment, but this was ""cyclical"" and not a structural phenomenon.', '""we do expect the number of foreign workers to grow at some point.', 'the prolonged decline is really a function of the border restrictions, and will not be representative of the demands of the different sectors,"" he said, adding that the drop in foreign employment in q1 was across different sectors.', 'mr kam said that the fall in foreign worker numbers also has some bearing on projections in the second quarter as the output in some sectors like construction, which is reliant on foreign labour, will be reduced.', 'responding to a reporter\'s question on when border restrictions may be relaxed so firms can hire the foreign workers they need, dr tan said that this depends on many factors and a ""key variable"" is the covid-19 situation in the countries where the workers are from.', 'he added that there is a ""risk quota"" to determine the inflow of workers.', '""it is a daily, weekly and monthly calibration and titration according to the risks of the imports from these countries, versus what we can deal (with) in terms of our healthcare facilities,"" he said.', 'more job vacancies, fewer retrenchmentsthe number of job vacancies increased further to 68,400 in march and the rise was reported in all industries, said mom.', 'in particular, job vacancies were seen in manufacturing (mainly in fabricated metal products, machinery & equipment and electronics), public administration and education, construction, information and communications, as well as financial services.', 'the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed people improved from 0.', '75 in december 2020 to 0.', '96, or nearly one job vacancy for every unemployed person in march.', 'this is within the pre-pandemic range, which was 0.', '82 to 1.', '09 from 2018 to 2019, said mom.', 'the number of retrenchments fell to 2,270, and the six-month re-entry rate among retrenched residents (66 per cent) rose in q1 this year for the second consecutive quarter.', '""more than half of retrenchments which occurred in q1 2021 were due to restructuring and re-organisation, while retrenchments due to recession or downturn in industry made up a smaller proportion compared to a

2021-06-17,Playwright Alfian Sa'at questions PA's selective quoting of Sarah Bagharib's remarks in interview on Hari Raya standee fiasco.,"playwright alfian sa'at on tuesday night (15 june) questioned what appears to be the people's association (pa)'s selective quoting of communications specialist sarah bagharib's remarks in an interview with nanyang technological university professor walid j.  abdullah on the hari raya standee fiasco. pa had used ms sarah's wedding photograph as a prop in its hari raya aidilfitri display at an hdb estate in tiong bahru.  while the standee was subsequently removed and the pa offered her a public apology, the organisation later said it rejects ms sarah's ""accusations"" of racism, branding the incident ""culturally insensitive"" and an ""isolated case"". posting on facebook on monday, pa referenced her interview with assistant professor walid, claiming that ms sarah mentioned that the incident has perpetuated a culture of racism. ""it is not right to raise the allegation of racism, without basis, to stoke emotions and sentiments,"" said pa. the organisation claimed that it had explained to ms sarah that while it acknowledges that its staff ""should have been more culturally sensitive"", it is not right to paint ""sweeping conclusions from this incident"". doubling down on its point that ms sarah's case was an isolated one, pa said that it finds ms sarah's public call for messages or suggestions that they would like to have relayed to the organisation in their meeting an ""odd"" one. ""we do not see why our meeting should be appropriated as a platform for her to funnel the views and comments of persons unrelated to the incident,"" said pa, adding that it is of the view that ms sarah's purpose in agreeing to meet its representatives ""has gone far beyond the radin mas incident"". pa said that it will not be following through with the meeting as there is ""no point"" in doing so, in light of the above. ""we agree it is important for our staff and volunteers to be sensitive to and knowledgeable about the cultures of all our ethnic groups.  we are now looking at establishing a resource panel to guide and advise our staff on cultural matters.  we will also step up training efforts to enhance staff and volunteers' understanding and appreciation of our different cultures,"" it added. pa also claimed that ms sarah's 1 june email had falsely alleged that it was ""hasty in sharing the name of the vendor"" in order to ""distance and deflect blame"" from itself. ""the vendor had identified himself directly to ms sarah on 28 may, and apologised.  this was before pa issued our statement on 29 may,"" it said. ""it is regrettable that ms sarah did not clarify this point during her instagram live interview with mr walid j.  abdullah on 7 june.  instead she persisted in conveying the impression that pa had deflected blame from itself,"" pa added. the short length of the quotes attached by pa in its follow-up post, said mr alfian, had aroused his suspicion, as ""to build a case against someone it is always important to be able to reproduce what they said in full"". ""scanning through pa's statement, one would be forgiven if one thought that ms sarah was the one who made the claim that what pa did ""perpetuate[d] [a] racist culture"".  but she was actually sharing something someone else had written,"" he noted. ms sarah had in fact quoted a female chinese clinical psychologist's comment, who wrote:""this whole thread is written with much labour, can we chinese singaporeans please appreciate the labour and educate ourselves on our conditioned racism? it's long overdue towards our friends in minority communities who have to put up with our ignoranceâwhich continues to perpetuate the racist culture that hurts them. ""the comment in itself did not state that the act of putting up the offending decorations in itself had perpetuated a culture of racism â rather, it is the cultural ignorance in the process of doing so that is racist, said mr alfian. ms sarah, he added, did not directly make remarks such as ""this racist incident"" or ""and other similar racist incidents"" in the interview. instead, she said:""allyship plays a big part in promoting true racial harmonyâone that goes beyond ""racial tolerance"".  i am so, so grateful to allies who have used their voices to stand in solidarity with razif and i, and ethnic minority communities, in the aftermath of this incident (and other racist attacks and incidents that have been filmed). """"i think ms sarah has been at pains to assert that all singaporeans, and not just minorities, are stakeholders in the issue.  hers isn't some kind of minority grievance whose aim is to indict an entire majority community,"" said mr alfian. referencing pa's claim that its error was not born out of racism, but rather out of ""cultural insensitivity"", the playwright said that the model of ""racial harmony"" that the organisation has been operating on ""would not recognise that something is racist unless it ""disrupts"" harmony"". ""of course the people at pa would want to distance themselves from ""obvious"" racists like beow tan, tan boon lee and the gong lady,"" he said, adding that pleading ""cultural insensitivity"" is a way of justifying ""racism that is not tantamount to public nuisance"". addressing pa's claim that ms sarah had spoken about its ""staff and volunteers"" being ""blind to racism"", mr alfian said that he could not find the alleged statement anywhere in the whole interview. ""what i found instead was this, 9 minutes from the end.  walid jokes with her about whether she'd have a teh tarik with melvin yong (the mp on the banner),"" he said. quoting ms sarah:""there was a light-up event, at tiong bahru arcade, where the standee was as well, and i wonder if he saw it? there was a light up hari raya event, at that very stage.  with his face, and the kampung thing, coconut tree and all of it.  so i wondered if he saw the standee, what he thought about it.  if he did, and he didn't say anything, or think twice, to think that something was wrong about it.  if i had teh tarik with him then i'd like to know if he did see that.  and if he did, and he didn't say anything about it, then something is definitely wrong, right?while there was a comment on internalised racism â on how ""we've been so conditioned to think in a certain way. . . that there's nothing wrong with this because people are colour blind, or blind to racism at play.  or there's nothing wrong, because it doesn't impact them"" â mr alfian noted that there was ""no mention of pa staff or volunteers"". ""it's a stretch, but maybe she was questioning whether the mp had noticed that something was wrongâand it's important to underline that these are questions, not accusations,"" he said. the playwright questioned whether much of the supposed efforts on those who speak of ""racial harmony"" are mostly concentrated on the ""in progress"" part than in doing ""the actual work"". ""because for me, one of the most important work is dialogueâreal dialogue with those on the other side of the aisle, not stage-managed ones of vetted questions and screened guest lists.  i dream of the day when pa can have a dialogue with ms sarah, or when zaobao editors can have one with the scholars who wrote in to them on their coverage of racial issues.  it's a dream that's entirely within reach,"" he said. professor walid, in his comment on mr alfian's post, highlighted that ms sarah was ""responding to a comment"" left by a viewer during the livestream ""when she talked about internalised racism"". ""because ig live does not save comments, and we were taking many comments, we do not even know what that specific comment refers to,"" he added. other commenters remarked that pa staff involved in the saga ""need to take a critical reading class"" and that by ""unilaterally cancelling a planned meeting"" with ms sarah, the organisation is ""essentially indicating that they do not want to do the hard work of authentic dialogue"".  one of the ""smear campaigns constructed out of selective quotations"" referred to by mr alfian in his post earlier include pro-establishment factions such as facebook page singapore matters citing his social media post from 2012, in which mr alfian had reportedly told today that he ""would love to become a malaysian"". in june last year, mr alfian also had to issue a refutation against the ""pro-malaysia activist"" narrative made against him. among the points made by mr alfian include his past criticism in 2014 on how the bumiputera policy ""has been hijacked and corrupted"" by ""umnoputras"" through ""cronyism, nepotism and corruption"". ""of all the accusations in that post, this one is the most obviously defamatory.  i had to comb through all my posts to see what i had written about 'bumiputera policies'.  and there's not a single post that mentions endorsement of the policy, nor my wish for it to be implemented in singapore.  if anything, there is awareness of how it has been hijacked and corrupted,"" he wrote. touching on the claim that he had ""mocked"" singapore's approach in the maritime dispute with malaysia in 2019 as ""jingoism"", mr alfian clarified that his comments expressed his ""dovish"" anxiety over military escalation in the johor straits at the time. ""i expect our elected officials to exhaust all diplomatic channels for solutions rather than to rely on 'jingoism'âextreme nationalism, in the form of aggressive or warlike foreign policy,"" he wrote. in his commentary on his poem ""singapore you are not my country"", mr alfian highlighted that then-education minister ong ye kung did not quote the poem in full when the latter cited it in parliament in october 2019. in delivering his speech on the cancellation of a yale-nus programme which mr alfian was initially invited to run, mr ong quoted part of mr alfian's poem ""singapore you are not my country"", which was written in 1998, to give parliament ""a flavour"" of the literary figure's ""thinking"". mr ong said:""singapore, i assert you are not a country at all,
do not raise your voice against me, i am not afraid of your anthem""later part of the poem says:"". . . how can you call yourself a country,
you terrible hallucination of highways and cranes and condominiums
ten minutes' drive from the mrt?""""this is a poem, and we might concede some artistic licence.  but mr alfian sa'at continues this attitude consistently in his activism. ""mr alfian in a facebook post later clarified that the line quoted by mr ong, when placed in context, appears as seen below:do not raise your voice against me,
i am not afraid of your anthem
although the lyrics are still bleeding from
the bark of my sapless heart. mr alfian elaborated that the context in which the line ""i am not afraid of your anthem"" appears describes the anthem's presence in his upbringing as a singaporean and how it ""bleeds from my heart"". contrary to what the line appears to suggest on the surface, 'i am not afraid of your anthem' actually reveals the fear of vulnerability and of having the anthem ""rouse patriotic feelings in me"", he added. ""i am afraid of this patriotic love because it is so involuntarily, it comes from a primordial and irresistible place from deep inside,"" said mr alfian.  ""i am afraid of these volcanic feelings because i want to protect myself from loving something too much. """"just stopping on the word 'anthem' might suggest that i am somehow rejecting symbols of the state,"" he said. the aforementioned yale-nus programme, which was renamed ""dialogue and dissent in singapore"", was originally set to take place from 29 september to 5 october in 2019. contrary to the allegations made in a yale report on the cancellation, which he said painted him as ""defiant and intransigent"", mr alfian said that he was open to removing certain elements from the original programme itinerary and substituting such elements with others, in light of sensitivities arising from contemporary developments at the time. an example of such, according to mr alfian, included removing the screening of a documentary on hong kong civil rights activist joshua wong after a yale-nus representative â who he addressed as ""person d"" â on 11 sep raised concerns pertaining to the ongoing protests in the city.

'posting on facebook on monday, pa referenced her interview with assistant professor walid, claiming that ms sarah mentioned that the incident has perpetuated a culture of racism.', '""it is not right to raise the allegation of racism, without basis, to stoke emotions and sentiments,"" said pa. the organisation claimed that it had explained to ms sarah that while it acknowledges that its staff ""should have been more culturally sensitive"", it is not right to paint ""sweeping conclusions from this incident"".', 'doubling down on its point that ms sarah\'s case was an isolated one, pa said that it finds ms sarah\'s public call for messages or suggestions that they would like to have relayed to the organisation in their meeting an ""odd"" one.', '""we do not see why our meeting should be appropriated as a platform for her to funnel the views and comments of persons unrelated to the incident,"" said pa, adding that it is of the view that ms sarah\'s purpose in agreeing to meet its representatives ""has gone far beyond the radin mas incident"".', 'pa said that it will not be following through with the meeting as there is ""no point"" in doing so, in light of the above.', '""we agree it is important for our staff and volunteers to be sensitive to and knowledgeable about the cultures of all our ethnic groups.', 'we are now looking at establishing a resource panel to guide and

""i want to say that the image of president biden that our press and even the american press paints has nothing in common with reality,"" putin told the graduates. ""he was on a long trip, had flown across the ocean, and had to contend with jet lag and the time difference.  when i fly it takes its toll.  but he looked cheerful, we spoke face-to-face for two or maybe more hours.  he's completely across his brief,"" said putin.   ""biden is a professional, and you have to be very careful in working with him to make sure you don't miss anything.  he doesn't miss anything, i can assure you. ""earlier, putin's spokesman said on thursday the summit had also laid the ground for what he described as really tough technical talks on a potential prisoner swap between russia and the united states. dmitry peskov, the spokesman, said the lists of prisoners to be potentially exchanged still needed to be sorted out but was much wider than those publicly discussed. he said negotiations would obviously have to be conducted quietly and in secret. peskov, who attended the summit himself, said it had broadly unfolded as russia had expected and that the meeting, from a kremlin viewpoint, had gone smoothly.  ""it went off rather well, with a plus sign,"" dmitry peskov told the ekho moskvy radio station.   ""it was productive in the sense that the two leaders had the chance to directly explain their positions, more or less understand where they can cooperate, and where right now they can't cooperate because of categorical differences in their views.  that also happened and that's also a plus,"" he said.  peskov singled out a joint statement that reaffirmed the two countries' belief that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. ""it may be a short statement but. . . it reflects the special responsibility of our two countries not only before our own peoples but, as pretentious as it may sound, before the whole world,"" said peskov. russia's deputy foreign minister said separately that moscow expected arms control talks with the united states, that were agreed at the summit, to start within weeks. he said moscow felt reassured by the joint statement on the need to never wage nuclear war and to start arms control talks. ""the confirmation of the formula that there can be no winner in a nuclear war and that one must not be waged is a significant achievement,"" ryabkov told the kommersant daily newspaper.  ""frankly speaking, we had growing concerns in recent years about washington's readiness to support this.  this is not a figure of speech or lofty words but simply a reflection of reality.

2021-06-17,"Hong Kong police arrest Apple Daily executives, seize reporting materials in national security law raid, East Asia News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. hong kong nine months after the apple daily newsroom was raided, hundreds of officers again swept the office early thursday morning (june 17)  and arrested five top executives under national security charges, in what the local journalist body calls ""a heavy blow to press freedom"". hong kong police said 500 officers raided the anti-government tabloid's tseung kwan o office at 7. 30am, going through reporters' documents and notes, with apple daily streaming the event live online. in a briefing, senior superintendent steve li said  at least 30 articles published in 2019 may have breached national security by calling for foreign sanctions against the hong kong and central governments. this is the first time where authorities said news articles could potentially violate the security law. supt li, who heads the police force's national security department, said secretary for security john lee had issued  an order to freeze hk$18 million (s$3. 8 million)  worth of assets from apple daily limited, apple daily printing limited and ad internet limited. five executives of apple daily and next digital editor-in-chief ryan law, chief executive cheung kim hung, chief operating officer chow tat kuen, deputy chief editor chan pui man and chief executive editor cheung chi wai were detained on allegations of colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security. next digital publishes apple daily, a well-read tabloid that is often critical of hong kong and mainland chinese leadership. said mr li: ""we have very strong evidence that the questionable articles play a very crucial part for the conspiracy which provides the ammunition for foreign countries and institutions or organisations to impose sanctions to hong kong and the people's republic of china. ""he also warned the public that they could face prosecution for sharing the reports on social media. hours after the raid,  the secretary for security told the public and media to cut all ties with the five arrested executives. ""if you stand with these suspects, you will pay a hefty price.  you should cut ties with the suspects or you'll regret it very much,""  said mr lee. without elaborating on whether the articles were news reports or opinion pieces, he added that the operation was aimed at those who use reporting as a ""tool to endanger"" national security. ""no one should use news reporting as a disguise or safe haven to endanger national security.  the hong kong government will use all legal measures to prevent, interdict, and suppress such activities,"" he said. the hong kong journalists association (hkja) said  that the police sweep is a heavy blow to  press freedom. chairman chris yeung described the raid as ""horrible"", saying that it will spread fear among the news industry. ""if news reporting materials are not protected by the law, self-censorship among journalists will become more and more common,"" he said. the european union said the raid shows that china is using its new national security law to silence the media and freedom of expression. ""this morning's raid on the offices of newspaper apple daily and the arrests of five of its senior management further demonstrates how the national security law is being used to stifle media freedom and freedom of expression in hong kong,"" nabila massrali, eu spokesperson for foreign affairs and security policy said in a statement. ""it is essential that all the existing rights and freedoms of hong kong residents are fully protected, including freedom of the press and of publication,"" she added. similarly, british foreign secretary dominic raab accused china of using the law to target dissent, rather than deal with public security. ""today's raids and arrests at apple daily in hong kong demonstrate beijing is using the national security law to target dissenting voices, not tackle public security,"" british foreign secretary dominic raab said. ""freedom of the press is one of the rights china promised to protect in the joint declaration and should be respected,"" he said. taiwan's foreign minister jaushieh joseph wu wrote on social media that he is saddened to witness the raid  on the news tabloid, which is a desperately endangered symbol of freedom in hong kong.  the raid is  the latest blow to media tycoon jimmy lai, the tabloid's owner and a vocal beijing critic, whose assets are already frozen under the security law and who is serving prison sentences for taking part in illegal assemblies. lai, whose meetings with former united states vice-president mike pence and other top american officials in 2019 outraged china, has been a persistent thorn for beijing who views him as a traitor. he is the highest-profile figure in the pro-democracy camp and was part of a 2019 full-court press of hong kong pro-democracy figures who urged the us to pass laws imposing sanctions if beijing eroded hong kong's semi-autonomous status.  the security law clearly outlaws seeking sanctions from foreign governments. trading in shares of next digital were suspended on thursday and it is unclear how apple daily's operations will be affected.

""based on the data available at the directorate-general of immigration, it is confirmed that the two people are the same,"" said ago spokesman leonard eben ezer simanjuntak. in his home country of indonesia, adelin was notorious among environmentalists as the destroyer of forests in sumatra. ""he's a big fish.  his business in the downstream and upstream logging sector and his illegal logging activities, including business in oil palm plantations, have destroyed forests and caused state losses,"" mr arie rompas, forest campaign team leader of environmental group greenpeace indonesia, told the straits times. mr leonard said adelin has been a fugitive since 2008 and was listed on the interpol red notice. in august 2008, indonesia's supreme court found him guilty of corruption and illegal logging in north sumatra province, and sentenced him to 10 years in prison and a fine of 110 billion rupiah (s$10 million). the verdict overturned a previous acquittal by a lower court, medan district court, in november 2007 which had sparked public outcry nationwide on concerns that witness testimonies were not properly considered by the judges and field investigation was lacking. adelin, the son of the owner of pt mujur timber, a wood-processing company in sibolga, north sumatra, has been on the wanted list of the north sumatra prosecutor's office since july 2012. mr leonard also said adelin and his bodyguards had resisted arrest at the indonesian embassy in beijing in 2006, beating up the embassy staff before fleeing. as such, indonesia's attorney-general hopes the indonesian law enforcement officers will be allowed ""a special pick-up of this high-profile fugitive"" from singapore, he added. according to the ica, the indonesian embassy had offered to repatriate adelin to indonesia via private air transportation on june 16. ""however, ica had declined this arrangement as the repatriation of all undesirable foreigners is independently conducted by singapore authorities,"" the ica spokesman said. ""in accordance with ica's established procedure, adelin lis will be repatriated to his country of origin as soon as his commercial flight arrangement is confirmed.

""i have already sent him a message and he has let us know that he is ok.  i have already asked the coach if i could visit him in the hospital, we will see if that is possible,"" lukaku told a news conference on wednesday. but the belgian emphasised there would be no sympathy on the pitch for denmark, who have been rattled by the incident during their opening game against finland which they then lost.

2021-06-17,Locatelli brace eases Italy into Euro 2020 last 16.," share copiedmanuel locatelli of italy celebrates during the euro 2020 group a match against switzerland in rome, italy, june 16, 2021.  /cfpmanuel locatelli bagged a brace of goals for the first time in his career as imperious italy defeated switzerland 3-0 at the stadio olimpico on wednesday to become the first side into the last-16 of euro 2020. midfielder locatelli started and finished the move from which he opened the scoring, netting from close range following sassuolo team mate domenico berardi's excellent run down the right wing.  he then rifled a shot into the bottom corner of the net from the edge of the box early in the second half. ciro immobile added a late third to secure back-to-back 3-0 wins for italy in the tournament, which extends their unbeaten run to 29 games, the last 10 of which have been victories where they have scored 31 goals and conceded none. italy lead group a with six points after two rounds of matches and are ahead of wales (four), switzerland (one) and turkey (zero).  they can seal top spot with a draw in their final group game against wales on sunday when the swiss face turkey. the italians outclassed their opponents and delighted the home crowd who have now seen their side score three times in a european championship match for the second game in a row having never done so previously. italy skipper giorgio chiellini, making his 14th european championship appearance, more than any other outfield player for italy, thought he had scored when he powered past two defenders to fire in from close range only for his effort to be ruled out for handball. the italians were not to be denied, however, even after chiellini went off injured, with locatelli launching a move with a brilliant pass and then finishing it off after berardi had cut in from the right in the 26th minute. the swiss pressed high after the break in search of an equalizer but it was italy who scored again with locatelli rifling in from the edge of the box for his second goal of the evening. italy keeper gianluigi donnarumma stopped a double effort from steven zuber in the 64th minute to protect their flawless record over the last 10 games, before immobile twice fired narrowly wide. the italy striker did get onto the scoresheet in the 89th, however, thumping in his shot from 20 meters to beat keeper yann sommer. switzerland have now won none of their last nine matches against italy and last beat their neighbors 28 years ago. wales players celebrate after winning the euro 2020 group a match against turkey in baku, azerbaijan, june 16, 2021.  /cfpelsewhere on wednesday, wales captain gareth bale inspired a scintillating 2-0 victory for his side over turkey, giving the dragons a big leap towards the european championship knockout stages and reviving memories of their 2016 run to the semi-finals. midfielder aaron ramsey missed two early chances, but made no mistake just before halftime when he chested down bale's perfect ball over the defence to slot past the goalkeeper. wales could have doubled the lead at the hour mark when bale was tripped by zeki celik and awarded a penalty, but the welsh skipper skied his effort after a stuttering run up. wales were rewarded for their superiority throughout when they scored right at the death as a corner was played short and defender connor roberts was on hand to divert another bale pass past goalkeeper ugurcan cakir. russia defeated finland 1-0 with a first-hald goal from aleksei miranchuk, as they bounced back from losing their opening

2021-06-17,"PA's decision to cancel planned meeting ""disappointing""; dialogue more than just about intellectual property rights infringement, says Sarah Bagharib.","source: sarah bagharib @sarahbagharib / instagramthe people's association (pa)'s decision to cancel a planned meeting pertaining to the organisation's use of her wedding photograph as a prop in its hari raya aidilfitri display at an hdb estate in tiong bahru is ""disappointing"", said communications specialist sarah bagharib. while the standee was subsequently removed and the pa offered her a public apology, the organisation later said it rejects ms sarah's ""accusations"" of racism, branding the incident ""culturally insensitive"" and an ""isolated case"". pa's move to cancel the meeting, said ms sarah in an instagram post on tuesday (15 june), resulted in ""a missed opportunity for constructive dialogue"". such a move has also hampered chances of having ""thoughts and suggestions of members of the community to be relayed"" to the organisation, she added. ""this incident didn't just affect my husband and i through the 'culturally insensitive' depiction of hari raya celebrations, but also the wider community that celebrates hari raya.  we are all equal stakeholders in the work that pa does,"" said ms sarah. however, ms sarah said that she will not be deterred by pa's decision to cancel the meeting. ""we will continue to advocate for deeper intercultural understanding and greater social cohesion in our everyday lives as singaporeans,"" she said. a post shared by sarah bagharib (@sarahbagharib)posting on facebook on monday, pa referenced her interview with assistant professor walid, claiming that ms sarah mentioned that the incident has perpetuated a culture of racism. ""it is not right to raise the allegation of racism, without basis, to stoke emotions and sentiments,"" said pa. the organisation claimed that it had explained to ms sarah that while it acknowledges that its staff ""should have been more culturally sensitive"", it is not right to paint ""sweeping conclusions from this incident"". doubling down on its point that ms sarah's case was an isolated one, pa said that it finds ms sarah's public call for messages or suggestions that they would like to have relayed to the organisation in their meeting an ""odd"" one. ""we do not see why our meeting should be appropriated as a platform for her to funnel the views and comments of persons unrelated to the incident,"" said pa, adding that it is of the view that ms sarah's purpose in agreeing to meet its representatives ""has gone far beyond the radin mas incident"". pa said that it will not be following through with the meeting as there is ""no point"" in doing so, in light of the above. ""we agree it is important for our staff and volunteers to be sensitive to and knowledgeable about the cultures of all our ethnic groups.  we are now looking at establishing a resource panel to guide and advise our staff on cultural matters.  we will also step up training efforts to enhance staff and volunteers' understanding and appreciation of our different cultures,"" it added. pa also claimed that ms sarah's 1 june email had falsely alleged that it was ""hasty in sharing the name of the vendor"" in order to ""distance and deflect blame"" from itself. ""the vendor had identified himself directly to ms sarah on 28 may, and apologised.  this was before pa issued our statement on 29 may,"" it said. ""it is regrettable that ms sarah did not clarify this point during her instagram live interview with mr walid j.  abdullah on 7 june.  instead she persisted in conveying the impression that pa had deflected blame from itself,"" pa added. the short length of the quotes attached by pa in its follow-up post, said playwright alfian sa'at, was suspicious, as ""to build a case against someone it is always important to be able to reproduce what they said in full"". ""scanning through pa's statement, one would be forgiven if one thought that ms sarah was the one who made the claim that what pa did ""perpetuate[d] [a] racist culture"".  but she was actually sharing something someone else had written,"" he noted. ms sarah had in fact quoted a female chinese clinical psychologist's comment, who wrote:""this whole thread is written with much labour, can we chinese singaporeans please appreciate the labour and educate ourselves on our conditioned racism? it's long overdue towards our friends in minority communities who have to put up with our ignoranceâwhich continues to perpetuate the racist culture that hurts them. ""the comment in itself did not state that the act of putting up the offending decorations in itself had perpetuated a culture of racism â rather, it is the cultural ignorance in the process of doing so that is racist, said mr alfian. ms sarah, he added, did not directly make remarks such as ""this racist incident"" or ""and other similar racist incidents"" in the interview. instead, she said:""allyship plays a big part in promoting true racial harmonyâone that goes beyond ""racial tolerance"".  i am so, so grateful to allies who have used their voices to stand in solidarity with razif and i, and ethnic minority communities, in the aftermath of this incident (and other racist attacks and incidents that have been filmed). """"i think ms sarah has been at pains to assert that all singaporeans, and not just minorities, are stakeholders in the issue.  hers isn't some kind of minority grievance whose aim is to indict an entire majority community,"" said mr alfian. referencing pa's claim that its error was not born out of racism, but rather out of ""cultural insensitivity"", the playwright said that the model of ""racial harmony"" that the organisation has been operating on ""would not recognise that something is racist unless it ""disrupts"" harmony"". ""of course the people at pa would want to distance themselves from ""obvious"" racists like beow tan, tan boon lee and the gong lady,"" he said, adding that pleading ""cultural insensitivity"" is a way of justifying ""racism that is not tantamount to public nuisance"". addressing pa's claim that ms sarah had spoken about its ""staff and volunteers"" being ""blind to racism"", mr alfian said that he could not find the alleged statement anywhere in the whole interview. ""what i found instead was this, 9 minutes from the end.  walid jokes with her about whether she'd have a teh tarik with melvin yong (the mp on the banner),"" he said. quoting ms sarah:""there was a light-up event, at tiong bahru arcade, where the standee was as well, and i wonder if he saw it? there was a light up hari raya event, at that very stage.  with his face, and the kampung thing, coconut tree and all of it.  so i wondered if he saw the standee, what he thought about it.  if he did, and he didn't say anything, or think twice, to think that something was wrong about it.  if i had teh tarik with him then i'd like to know if he did see that.  and if he did, and he didn't say anything about it, then something is definitely wrong, right?while there was a comment on internalised racism â on how ""we've been so conditioned to think in a certain way. . . that there's nothing wrong with this because people are colour blind, or blind to racism at play.  or there's nothing wrong, because it doesn't impact them"" â mr alfian noted that there was ""no mention of pa staff or volunteers"". ""it's a stretch, but maybe she was questioning whether the mp had noticed that something was wrongâand it's important to underline that these are questions, not accusations,"" he said. the playwright questioned whether much of the supposed efforts on those who speak of ""racial harmony"" are mostly concentrated on the ""in progress"" part than in doing ""the actual work"". ""because for me, one of the most important work is dialogueâreal dialogue with those on the other side of the aisle, not stage-managed ones of vetted questions and screened guest lists.  i dream of the day when pa can have a dialogue with ms sarah, or when zaobao editors can have one with the scholars who wrote in to them on their coverage of racial issues.  it's a dream that's entirely within reach,"" he said.

2021-06-17,Kingâs powers and the Constitution.,"
                    thursday, 17 jun 2021
                is the article 150 power to declare or revoke an emergency or to set up a national operations council as in 1969 a discretionary or a non-discretionary function?our constitution has invested the yang di-pertuan agong with vast powers and functions in the executive, legislative and judicial fields and in relation to islam. a computer check indicates that the words ""yang di-pertuan agong"" occur in the federal constitution 274 times!if all of these 274 mentions indicate the existence of discretionary powers, then his majesty is obviously an absolute and not a constitutional monarch. it is submitted that the proper approach to constitutional interpretation is that no provision conferring power and function on the king should be interpreted literally or in isolation but must be read in the light of articles 40(1) and 40(1a), which require his majesty to act on advice. articles 40 and 40(1a) must be grafted onto every article where the words ""yang di-pertuan agong"" occur unless the provision explicitly confers discretion. the powers and functions of our king are divisible into two broad categories:> non-discretionary functions, which are exercised on advice and constitute the bulk of his functions. concerning these, the monarch may advise, caution, warn and delay but must, in the last resort, accept the advice rendered; and> discretionary powers, which are exercised in his own judgment. the king may consult anyone including his brother rulers, the prime minister, attorney general, respected public or private figures, or any experts he may choose to summon to the palace.  but ultimately, the mantle of responsibility falls on his great shoulders. discretionary functions are mentioned in article 40(2) and cover the following critical matters of state: appointment of a prime minister; withholding of consent to a request for dissolution of parliament; convening of the conference of rulers; and ""any other case mentioned in this constitution"". it is submitted that the words ""any other case mentioned in this constitution"" must mean ""any other case (explicitly) mentioned"", for example concerning the appointment of the public service commission under article 139(4); appointment of the education service commission under article 141a(2); appointment of other commission members under article 143(1)(a); and appointment of state governors under the 8th schedule, item 19a. in several situations, the king's personal discretion is necessarily implied. these situations are the right under article 40(1) to ask for any information from the government; delaying legislation by 30 days under article 66(4a); appointment of a caretaker prime minister after parliament is dissolved under article 43(2); and appointment of an interim, minority, provisional or unity government if there is a deeply fractured or ""hung parliament"" with no faction commanding an absolute majority. in the past few weeks, the question on many lips is whether the article 150 power to declare or revoke an emergency or to set up a national operations council as in 1969 is a discretionary or non-discretionary function. it is submitted that the king's emergency powers are exercisable on advice. despite the subjective language of clause (1) of article 150 (""if the yang di-pertuan agong is satisfied""), it is noticeable that nowhere in article 150 is there any explicit mention of personal discretion. in several court cases, like stephen kalong ningkan v tun abang haji openg and tawi sli (no 2) (1967), m madhavan nair (1975), and teh cheng poh (1979), it has been ruled that emergency powers are subject to article 40(1). in teh cheng poh, there is this telling statement from the privy council that when one finds in the constitution or federal law powers conferred upon the yang di-pertuan agong that are expressed to be exercisable if he is of opinion or is satisfied, the reference to his opinion or satisfaction is, in reality, a reference to the collective opinion or satisfaction of members of the cabinet. despite the above judicial decisions, there are contrasting views that article 150 powers are independent of the prime minister's advice. these views are anchored on several facts. first, in 1983, then prime minister datuk seri dr mahathir mohamad pushed through parliament the constitution (amendment) act 1983, which amended article 150 to read: ""if the prime minister is satisfied that a grave emergency exists he shall advise the yang di-pertuan agong accordingly and the yang di-pertuan agong shall then issue a proclamation"". this amendment elicited strong opposition from the conference of rulers and was repealed in early 1984. the story behind the repeal lends credence to the view that emergency powers under article 150 are not subject to the prime minister's advice and are personal to the monarch. second, in october 2020, the present yang di-pertuan agong is known to have refused the prime minister's advice to proclaim an emergency. the refusal was not challenged in a court of law by the prime minister and sets a political precedent of the throne supplying a check and balance against the political executive's use of emergency powers. third, the emergency ordinance of jan 14, this year, in section 2 establishes an ""independent special committee"" appointed by the king ""to advise the yang di-pertuan agong on the continuing existence of the grave emergency"". why have this independent committee if the king is bound by cabinet advice?fourth, in the case of pp v mohd amin mohd razali (2000), the learned judge, zulkefli j. , suggested that in relation to article 150's emergency powers, though the king is bound by the advice of the prime minister, the prime minister whose advice is binding on the king must be one with democratic legitimacy in parliament. on may 15, 1969, there was no parliament and the prime minister was a caretaker prime minister without parliamentary backing. the judge ruled that in some circumstances, like during the dissolution of parliament when the prime minister is a mere caretaker, the king is not bound by the advice of the prime minister and can act independently. perhaps the mohd amin mohd razali precedent will also apply if the prime minister is an interim prime minister (like dr mahathir was in february 2020). what about our circumstances today?there is a duly appointed prime minister and cabinet in place.  an emergency is in operation. under section 11 of the ordinance of jan 14, the prime minister and cabinet have the security of tenure as long as the emergency lasts, i. e.  till aug 1. parliament is in suspension under section 14 of the ordinance. but on aug 1, the laws about parliament to reconvene will kick in. the guarantee of security of tenure for the prime minister will expire.  it is a matter of conjecture whether the prime minister will seek an extension of the emergency. what if the prime minister faces a vote of no-confidence in the reconvened house (or if the house is not in session), a challenge to his authority under the datuk seri nizar jamaluddin precedent of 2009 in perak?is the king entitled under the constitution's spirit of parliamentary democracy to advise the prime minister to settle the issue of confidence first before seeking an extension to the existing emergency proclamation or the issuance of a new one?what if, after aug 1, the prime minister loses a vote of no-confidence in the house and nobody else can secure a stable majority in the ""hung parliament""?will this be a ground for the king to act independently to proclaim a new emergency due to the collapse of civil government and to set up a national operations council?these are untested and untried issues.  what adds further complexity is that under article 150(8), the satisfaction of the yang di-pertuan agong cannot be challenged in a court of law. the writer is the holder of the tunku abdul rahman chair at um, and the tun hussein onn chair at isis malaysia.  the views expressed here are entirely his own.

                  thursday, 17 jun 2021\n                is the article 150 power to declare or revoke an emergency or to set up a national operations council as in 1969 a discretionary or a non-discretionary function?our constitution has invested the yang di-pertuan agong with vast powers and functions in the executive, legislative and judicial fields and in relation to islam.', 'a computer check indicates that the words ""yang di-pertuan agong"" occur in the federal constitution 274 times!if all of these 274 mentions indicate the existence of discretionary powers, then his majesty is obviously an absolute and not a constitutional monarch.', 'it is submitted that the proper approach to constitutional interpretation is that no provision conferring power and function on the king should be interpreted literally or in isolation but must be read in the light of articles 40(1) and 40(1a), which require his majesty to act on advice.', 'articles 40 and 40(1a) must be grafted onto every article where the words ""yang di-pertuan agong"" occur unless the provision explicitly confers discretion.', 'the powers and functions of our king are divisible into two broad categories:> non-discretionary functions, which are exercised on advice and constitute the bulk of his functions.', 'concerning these, the monarch may advise, caution, warn and delay but must, in the last resort, accept the advice rendered; and> discretionary powers, which are exercised in his own judgment.', 'the king may consult anyone including his brother rulers, the prime minister, attorney general, respected public or private figures, or any experts he may choose to summon to the palace.', 'but ultimately, the mantle of responsibility falls on his great shoulders.', 'discretionary functions are mentioned in article 40(2) and cover the following critical matters of state: appointment of a prime minister; withholding of consent to a request for dissolution of parliament; convening of the conference of rulers; and ""any other case mentioned in this constitution"".', 'it is submitted that the words ""any other case mentioned in this constitution"" must mean ""any other case (explicitly) mentioned"", for example concerning the appointment of the public service commission under article 139(4); appointment of the education service commission under article 141a(2); appointment of other commission members under article 143(1)(a); and appointment of state governors under the 8th schedule, item 19a.', ""in several situations, the king's personal discretion is necessarily implied."", 'these situations are the right under article 40(1) to ask for any information from the government; delaying legislation by 30 days under article 66(4a); appointment of a caretaker prime minister after parliament is dissolved under article 43(2); and appointment of an interim, minority, provisional or unity government if there is a deeply fractured or ""hung parliament"" with no faction commanding an absolute majority.', 'in the past few weeks, the question on many lips is whether the article 150 power to declare or revoke an emergency or to set up a national operations council as in 1969 is a discretionary or non-discretionary function.', ""it is submitted that the king's emergency powers are exercisable on advice."", 'despite the subjective language of clause (1) of article 150 (""if the yang di-pertuan agong is satisfied""), it is noticeable that nowhere in article 150 is there any explicit mention of personal discretion.', 'in several court cases, like stephen kalong ningkan v tun abang haji openg and tawi sli (no 2) (1967), m madhavan nair (1975), and teh cheng poh (1979), it has been ruled that emergency powers are subject to article 40(1).', 'in teh cheng poh, there is this telling statement from the privy council that when one finds in the constitution or federal law powers conferred upon the yang di-pertuan agong that are expressed to be exercisable if he is of opinion or is satisfied, the reference to his opinion or satisfaction is, in reality, a reference to the collective opinion or satisfaction of members of the cabinet.', ""despite the above judicial decisions, there are contrasting views that article 150 powers are independent of the prime minister's advice."", 'these views are anchored on several facts.', 'first, in 1983, then prime minister datuk seri dr mahathir mohamad pushed through parliament the constitution (amendment) act 1983, which amended article 150 to read: ""if the prime minister is satisfied that a grave emergency exists he shall advise the yang di-pertuan agong accordingly and the yang di-pertuan agong shall then issue a proclamation"".', ""this amendment elicited strong opposition from the conference of rulers and was repealed in early 1984. the story behind the repeal lends credence to the view that emergency powers under article 150 are not subject to the prime minister's advice and are personal to the monarch."", ""second, in october 2020, the present yang di-pertuan agong is known to have refused the prime minister's advice to proclaim an emergency."", ""the refusal was not challenged in a court of law by the prime minister and sets a political precedent of the throne supplying a check and balance against the political executive's use of emergency powers."", 'third, the emergency ordinance of jan 14, this year, in section 2 establishes an ""independent special committee"" appointed by the king ""to advise the yang di-pertuan agong on the continuing existence of the grave emergency"".', ""why have this independent committee if the king is bound by cabinet advice?fourth, in the case of pp v mohd amin mohd razali (2000), the learned judge, zulkefli j. , suggested that in relation to article 150's emergency powers, though the king is bound by the advice of the prime minister, the prime minister whose advice is binding on the king must be one with democratic legitimacy in parliament."", 'on may 15, 1969, there was no parliament and the prime minister was a caretaker prime minister without parliamentary backing.', 'the judge ruled that in some circumstances, like during the dissolution of parliament when the prime minister is a mere caretaker, the king is not bound by the advice of the prime minister and can act independently.', 'perhaps the mohd amin mohd razali precedent will also apply if the prime minister is an interim prime minister (like dr mahathir was in february 2020).', 'what about our circumstances today?there is a duly appointed prime minister and cabinet in place.', 'an emergency is in operation.', 'under section 11 of the ordinance of jan 14, the prime minister and cabinet have the security of tenure as long as the emergency lasts, i. e.  till aug 1. parliament is in suspension under section 14 of the ordinance.', 'but on aug 1, the laws about parliament to reconvene will kick in.', 'the guarantee of security of tenure for the prime minister will expire.', 'it is a matter of conjecture whether the prime minister will seek an extension of the emergency.', 'what if the prime minister faces a vote of no-confidence in the reconvened house (or if the house is not in session), a challenge to his authority under the datuk seri nizar jamaluddin precedent of 2009 in perak?is the king entitled under the constitution\'s spirit of parliamentary democracy to advise the prime minister to settle the issue of confidence first before seeking an extension to the existing emergency proclamation or the issuance of a new one?what if, after aug 1, the prime minister loses a vote of no-confidence in the house and nobody else can secure a stable majority in the ""hung parliament""?will this be a ground for the king to act independently to proclaim a new emergency due to the collapse of civil government and to set up a national operations council?these are untested and untried issues.', 'what adds further complexity is that under article 150(8), the satisfaction of the yang di-pertuan agong cannot be challenged in a court of law.', 'the writer is the holder of the tunku abdul rahman chair at um, and the tun hussein onn chair at isis malaysia.', 'the views expressed here are entirely his own.', 'tags / keywords:\nemergency powers; yang dipertuan

""the us, for instance, dealt poorly with respect to the health crisis,"" he said.  ""others tried to tackle the health crisis but the economy suffered, like hong kong, singapore and australia. ""the us, however, implemented effective fiscal and monetary policy, providing ample liquidity to support economic activity, which helped cushion the blow of the pandemic despite a high number of infections, cabolis said. the annual rankings, which use hard data and surveys with executives, measure the prosperity and competitiveness of 64 nations on economic performance, government efficiency, business efficiency and infrastructure. the swiss-based imd ranked the us economy at 10, unchanged from last year, while taiwan's economy reached the top 10 the first time since the rankings began 33 years ago, moving from 11th last year to eighth this year. singapore's economy is still the top performer in asia, although it lost its number one spot to switzerland this year, sliding to fifth. while china is becoming increasingly competitive, there is room to improve its infrastructure, environment, education and health system, cabolis said. ""if we think about the eradication of poverty, this is a major win for the country, so to continue advancing these, it will definitely improve competitiveness,"" cabolis said. hong kong economy grows 7. 9 per cent in first quarter, higher than projectedhong kong saw a slight decline in its overall economic performance compared with last year, amid a worsening investment and employment environment, the imd report said. its private sector productivity and public finances also declined, although the city still scored high for government efficiency. closing its borders to contain the pandemic has had a strong impact on hong kong's talent pool, cabolis said. ""hong kong relies a lot on [connecting with] the global environment, issues of mobility, especially with respect to employment, are fundamental,"" cabolis said, adding the same was true for singapore. responding to the slide down the competitiveness rankings, the hong kong government said the city continued to serve as a ""gateway, springboard and intermediary"" into china. ""as a small and open economy, hong kong has faced unprecedented challenges over the past couple of years.  yet, we are confident that hong kong's institutional strengths, including the rule of law and independence of the judiciary, free trade and investment regimes, a simple and low tax system, a favourable business environment and an efficient government, remain unscathed,"" a government spokesman said in a statement. hong kong retains the top position for government efficiency, while the city ranks slightly lower than previous reports in aspects such as economic performance, business

2021-06-17,Indonesian man repeatedly entered S'pore with fake passport.,"singapore â a businessman wanted by the authorities in indonesia for graft repeatedly travelled to singapore between 2017 and 2018 using a bogus passport bearing another person's name, a court heard. adelin lis was finally arrested at changi airport while trying to leave the country using the fake passport in may 2018. at the state courts last wednesday (9 june), the 63-year-old indonesian fugitive was fined $14,000, having earlier in april pleaded guilty to four out of 15 charges under the immigration act. the remaining counts were considered in sentencing as part of his plea bargain. adelin paid the fine in two tranches last week and on wednesday (16 june). according to prosecution documents made available to yahoo news singapore by the attorney-general's chambers on thursday, adelin obtained singapore permanent residency in december 2002.  but he did not renew his re-entry permit as a permanent resident after it expired in december 2007 and so his pr status lapsed. while he was still a singapore pr, the businessman made 14 trips to singapore, entering and departing the country a total of 28 times via changi airport between april 2005 and september 2006.  he used his real passport on each trip. according to a report in the jakarta post, adelin was sentenced to 10 years' jail by the indonesian supreme court in august 2008 for corruption and illegal logging in north sumatra.  he has been on the wanted list of the north sumatra prosecutor's office since july 2012, the jakarta post report dated 23 july 2019 said. according to the court documents by singapore prosecutors, adelin was arrested by immigration officers at changi airport's terminal 3 departure hall on 8 may 2018.  he was trying to leave the country with an indonesian passport bearing the name of ""hendro leonardi"".  the passport also stated hendro's age to be three years younger than adelin. investigations revealed that the fugitive obtained the passport in 2008 and used it to successfully travel to and from singapore several times between july 2017 and 2018. he entered singapore on 20 july 2017 via seletar airport, and again on 26 october 2017, 11 february 2018 and 16 may 2018 via changi airport. each time he arrived, he obtained a 30-day visit pass by falsely declaring in his disembarkation form that he had never used a passport under a different name to enter the country.  he departed singapore on 24 july 2017, 2 november 2017 and 20 february 2018 via changi airport. but while trying to leave the country via terminal 3 on 28 may 2018, adelin's ruse fell apart and he was arrested. court documents did not state how his cover was blown and his real identity established. for each of adelin's four proceeded charges of making a false statement to obtain an entry pass, he could have been fined up to $4,000 and/or jailed up to a year. the penalty for producing a false document to an immigration officer is a fine of up to $6,000 and/or a jail term of up to two years. the punishment for entering singapore without a valid pass which has been lawfully issued is a jail term of up to six months with at least three strokes of the cane for male offenders below 50.  those found unsuitable for caning face a fine of up to $6,000 in lieu of caning. yahoo news singapore has reached out to the immigration and checkpoints authority on adelin's status and whether he remains in singapore or if he has been deported. stay in the know on-the-go: join yahoo singapore's telegram channel at

2021-06-17,"'The doctor slipped and fell down': 10 Singapore dads share the most unforgettable moments of their child's birth, Lifestyle News.","bringing a child into this world does not just involve the mother huffing and puffing away on the delivery table â fathers play a crucial role too.  whether they bravely stood through the entire bloody delivery process or gave moral support from afar, they are often a family's pillar of strength. to celebrate these important men this father's day, we talked to 10 dads who shared some of the most memorable moments of their kids' births, from the nerve-racking to the heartwarming.  mark chew, 35, auditorbefore my wife gave birth, we confirmed the epidural from the start whilst a c-section (caesarean section) was something that was planned late in the pregnancy after advice from the gynaecologist. i didn't get to accompany her in the delivery room due to covid-19 restrictions and i regret missing the delivery.  however, there is nothing i could do differently â i was suited up and ready to enter when the nurses informed me that due to the measures and changes communicated, i was no longer allowed to go inside. when i finally saw my child, i felt a sense of wonderment.  he was really fragile and small; something that i needed to protect. sudesh panicker, 57, consultanti planned to be present at the delivery but due to the emergency c-section, i was not permitted in. when i finally saw my child, i felt like crying.  it was like falling in love again, like there are no problems in the world and everything is going to be fine.  we must have done something right to deserve this gift.  he's 27 now and truly is ""the gift that keeps giving"".  we are so proud of who he is as a human being. i will always regret my wife and i not sharing that experience â me in a much more diminished manner, no doubt â in some small way.  however, i trust that our doctor made the right call.  he saved both my wife and my son.  no question about it. diren dorai raj, 57, chartered accountantwe opted for epidurals for both our children and prior to that, we discussed having a c-section and agreed that we will only do it unless absolutely necessary. i accompanied my wife in the delivery room when she was in labour.  our firstborn took two hours before the final push but our second baby was out within 20 minutes. one memorable part of my wife's labour was that the doctor slipped and fell whilst trying to pull my son out! but all was well in the end. gregory krygsman, 58, administratorprior to my wife giving birth, we talked to the gynaecologist about the possibilities of using pethidine or an epidural to ease the expected labour pains. while she was in labour, i wanted to be positive and present for her.  i looked at the monitor and told her when she should expect a contraction.  i also held her hand and let her squeeze it every time there was one and wiped her brows with a cold towel. as we have five children in total, we've had to go through this five times and the entire process for each child took around four hours. my most memorable takeaway from all of this would be the first time i was asked to see the placenta to witness the afterbirth and i almost fainted. some tips for soon-to-be parents â take note of the special days in the almanac when some mothers decide to induce their delivery to capture auspicious dates.  we ended up with one of the kids born on this day and boy, was it crowded.  bernard tang, 58, customer service officerwe had our boy late in our lives (50 and 40 years old respectively).  he was conceived through in-vitro fertilisation.  we tried that again but with no success. before my wife gave birth, we opted for an epidural.  however, during her labour, our gynaecologist decided to induce labour but after several hours, nothing happened.  that's when the decision to do a c-section was made.  overall, the whole process lasted nine hours. of course, the most memorable part of the experience would be the birth of my boy and me customarily cutting the umbilical cord.  i also witnessed the surgical assistant press down (quite forcibly, in my view) on my wife's belly to push the baby out. johnson lim, 35, engineerwe opted for a c-section, so it was all planned.  it was my wife's decision as she didn't want to go through the labour pains. [[nid:528631]]the most memorable part was the first sight of my son.  he was crying very loudly and covered in blood.  despite so, it was the most lovely moment. interestingly, my wife chose to stay awake for her delivery.  but after the baby was out, she was so happy and excited till she had difficulty breathing.  the doctor had to give her a jab to let her sleep. i think it's a very magical moment in life and something you and your wife should go through together. lim ben wei, 37, senior managerduring the birth of my son, my wife opted for a delivery without an epidural.  the pain was extremely unbearable, but my wife tried her very best to endure the pain and from her expressions, i could tell that she was suffering. when the baby was out, she cried and burst into tears upon seeing him for the first time.  overall, the entire procedure took 20 minutes. i can't imagine how much a human can endure for her kid during labour.  love is everything. charlton ng, 35, industrial relationsfor our first child, the contractions started at 4am and i went to the hospital and waited beside my spouse for sufficient dilation.  she was finally admitted at 6am and the baby came out at 4pm. she was given an epidural so contractions wouldn't hurt.  we had a momentary scare when the heart rate of our baby dropped drastically and the doctor had to intervene.  thankfully, the baby was fine. when it was time to push, my wife pushed for two hours, but baby couldn't come out because its head was in the wrong position.  eventually, the gynaecologist had to use forceps to pull our baby out and it was traumatic to watch that process.  there was lots of blood and the respect for my wife went up tremendously. for our second child, we opted for induced labour at around 5pm and the baby came out on the third push at 11pm.  however, my wife was in tremendous pain during dilation. only when the dilation was 8cm then did the nurse tell us that because we were an a ward patient, only a senior doctor could administer an epidural for us.  however, none of them were available at that moment and we were asked if we'd rather allow a medical officer to administer an epidural instead.  alamak, should have told us earlier â my wife had to endure so much pain. for our third child who is coming soon, we will request for an epidural immediately even if it's administered by a junior doctor. richie eu, 36, mergers and acquisitionsalthough her water broke early in the morning at 6am, my wife remained completely calm.  i, on the other hand, was panicking like a headless chicken and said we should go to the hospital straight away. my wife told me not to worry, proceeded to have a shower and completed a number of breathing exercises on a yoga ball.  we finally left for the hospital at 8. 30am and went straight into the delivery suite. there were varying waves of pre-labour contractions till she was fully dilated and my wife really only started 'pushing' at 3pm after an epidural was administered. our daughter was born on july 1, 2020 at 3. 30pm as a healthy and happy baby.  it was truly a surreal, out-of-body experience for the both of us. i was amazed at how calm my wife was throughout the entire process.  we had also attended a number of online antenatal classes so i was taken aback by how much of what we learned was employed during labour such as breathing and meditation exercises. i had held a preconceived notion â perhaps based on films and second hand accounts â that labour was a borderline traumatic experience filled with pain, but ours was the complete opposite.  if i could go back in time, i would have told myself to calm down!lambert chen, 35, businessmanwe were on the bed listening to our favourite songs when her water broke.  we quickly packed our bags and rushed to the hospital. when we reached the hospital, we brought out our cameras to video the process.  but it took another six hours for dilation.  in the end, when it was time for delivery, my back was blocking the camera.  the entire time apse was showing my beautiful back.  sounds were not omitted though.  overall, the entire process took eight hours. for me, the most memorable part of the whole process was when my wife teared while hugging our new born.  i would go through it all again and i won't change anything. melissateo@asiaone.

2021-06-17,Wife objects to husband's extramarital affair; he kills her.,"a delhi man, 25, was arrested here on wednesday for allegedly killing his wife and later misleading investigators by cooking up a false story, police said. vikas killed his wife priyanka as she had objected to his extramarital relationship with one of his sisters-in-law, they said. the couple also had differences over issues related to taking care of their newborn, they said. on tuesday, vikas had an argument with his wife, and in the night, he stabbed her to death with a knife, police said. after killing her, vikas made an acquaintance of his call the police control room (pcr).  he stated that a thief entered his house in south delhi's ranhola area and killed his wife, they said. on reaching the spot, police found stab injuries to the woman's neck.  her body was on a bed, police said. they said a case of murder was registered.  when vikas was questioned, he initially said a thief had entered the house and escaped from one of the upper floors after killing his wife, deputy commissioner of police (outer) parvinder singh said.

2021-06-17,"Experts divided on whether dining in should resume as cases spike, Latest Singapore News.","while the country cheered last week over the news that some measures in phase two (heightened alert) would be eased from june 13, the beleaguered food and beverage (f&b) industry also perked up when the ministry of health (moh) said dining in for groups of five will be allowed to resume from next monday, as long as the covid-19 situation remained under control. but with community infections spiking of late, they may now have to delay welcoming back dine-in customers. in a video on facebook yesterday, finance minister lawrence wong, co-chair of the multi-ministry task force tackling the pandemic, said the government is ""evaluating the timing and scope of the next stage of reopening"" because of the ""latest outbreak of cases"". dr paul tambyah, president of the asia-pacific society of clinical microbiology and infection, does not believe the current situation is dire enough to postpone lifting the restriction on dining in, especially with the country's vaccination numbers ticking up. he said: ""all these public health interventions are risk versus benefit calculations.  the economic and social impact of further restricting dining in is most likely going to far outweigh any possible benefit in reducing infections in a highly vaccinated society like ours. ""associate professor hsu li yang, vice-dean of global health at the saw swee hock school of public health at the national university of singapore (nus), said: ""we will have to ease measures sooner or later. ""the food and beverage industry has been severely affected over the past year, and the impact is disproportionately higher on the smaller establishments and elderly hawkers that are less tech-savvy and who are less able to transit to online deliveries. ""a delay in reopening would be tough on restaurants, hawkers and other f&b outlets, and will also be a blow to members of the public who have been looking forward to eating out. for dr hannah clapham, assistant professor at the saw swee hock school of public health at nus, vaccinations, transmissibility and timing are the keys to deciding whether to continue to ease measures. ""vaccination rates are rapidly increasing in the population, but we still have some way to go.  with the current delta variant being more transmissible, it is important to continue to keep a handle on the transmission until more people in the population are protected,"" she told the new paper yesterday. from june 6 to 12, the number of community infections here averaged 4. 6 cases.  the average for linked and unlinked cases was 2. 6 and 2, respectively. over the next four days, the average number of community infections grew to 15. 25, with an average of 12. 75 linked cases and 2. 5 unlinked cases. and as of yesterday, there were 39 cases linked to the cluster at bukit merah view market and food centre. referring to the spike in cases, dr leong hoe nam, an infectious diseases specialist at mount elizabeth novena hospital, said: ""the number of unlinked cases is important.  in fact, it is the more important of the two (linked and unlinked cases).  it tells us when cases were not anticipated and where contact tracing failed. ""with unlinked cases, we risk the virus spreading uncontrollably. ""while it is ""expected"" and ""normal"" for covid-19 community cases to hit double digits, he added: ""the number of unlinked cases should be below two and ideally none at all.  anything between three and five is worrying.  the virus spreads very fast. ""singapore moved to phase two (heightened alert) on may 16 after a spike in community cases, and it was slated to end on june 13 if the measures worked. with the number of cases falling, the moh announced that the country would move to phase three (heightened alert) starting from june 14, with people allowed to gather in groups of five, up from two, and operating capacity limits for attractions, cruises, museums and public libraries going up from 25 per cent to 50 per cent, among other moves. a further relaxation of measures, including dining in, was set to follow a week later. professor dale fisher, an infectious diseases expert from the nus yong loo lin school of medicine, has consistently emphasised the importance of the rate of vaccination. ""economically, many hawkers, restaurant owners and workers have been suffering.  on the other hand, there is a high risk of covid-19 spreading as people mingle with masks off.  this is the argument to balance,"" prof fisher said. ""of course, if everyone in the country were to be vaccinated, we would be comfortable that anyone infected would usually have only a mild illness, if anything.

""this multi-agency-corporate partnership is a great showcase of the creativity and collaboration that are vital to success in energy transition,"" said ms aw kah peng, chairman of shell companies in singapore, at the signing ceremony.  ""shell has a significant carbon footprint in singapore. . .  (and) you can count on shell to want to make this work. ""semakau is singapore's only remaining operational landfill, and the project will have to coexist with this primary function. with limited connectivity and infrastructure on the island, there will be challenges the stakeholders have to overcome.  it is the first time such a large-scale solar project is being explored in such a setting. for now, most of singapore's solar projects are smaller ones on rooftops at more than 5,000 hdb blocks or vacant industrial land.  more recently, others have been developed as floating projects, where solar panels are installed on water bodies like reservoirs. an offshore floating project in the johor strait has a capacity of about 5mwp, while the capacity at tengeh reservoir is 60mwp. shell, jtc, ema and nea said the semakau island farm will help to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 37,000 tonnes a year.  its location, about 2km from shell's pulau bukom energy and chemicals park, will also make it easier to integrate this renewable source of energy into its operations. in the long term, shell hopes to pivot its bukom park from its current focus on crude-oil and fuel-based products towards new, low-carbon value chains.  it has pledged to cut its carbon dioxide emissions in singapore by about a third within a decade, and be a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, as the climate crisis becomes more urgent.

jtc chief executive tan boon khai said the partners were already talking about this project two years ago, and it is an example of jtc's efforts to maximise land use to increase renewable energy generation. ""this signifies the strong collaboration that public service and government agencies have with many important private stakeholders, but more importantly, it pushes the boundaries of where we can go in land-scarce singapore,"" he said. ""it's quite amazing when you look at how small singapore is, that not only are we looking at solar, but also other green and sustainable solutions. ""last year, solar photovoltaic (pv) systems made up only 0. 56 per cent of the total electricity generated nationwide.  the government wants solar energy capacity to reach 2 per cent by 2025. already, the capacity of solar pv systems that have been contributing to the national grid has grown from 60mwp in 2015 to around 428mwp at the end of last year. an even larger project that is still being explored is the economic development board's proposed 100mwp floating solar system for private sector consumption.  the agency had launched a request for information in 2018, beginning with studies for it at kranji reservoir. jtc and shell will jointly conduct a request for information exercise for this project on june 24 to source solutions from the market. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright Â© 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-17,"Malaysia's rulers meeting: Lives and livelihood must be given priority, SE Asia News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. kuala lumpur (the star/asia news network) it was 7pm on wednesday (june 16) when the malay rulers concluded their meeting with the yang di-pertuan agong (malaysian king) at istana negara. the special meeting of the rulers started at 2. 30pm and most of them spoke openly and candidly. this was not a scheduled conference of rulers meeting, which would have included the respective yang di-pertuan negeri (heads of states), in the presence of the menteris besar and chief ministers. this time, it was just the malay rulers and no one else. on their minds were four main issues the emergency which ends aug 1, the covid-19 pandemic, vaccination exercise and parliament. it was clear they wanted the parliament to convene as soon as possible although no date was mentioned. in the statement issued after the meeting by keeper of the rulers' seal, tan sri syed danial syed ahmad, the malay rulers declared that there was no need to place the country under the emergency beyond aug 1. the rulers concurred with the view of the king that parliament should be reconvened as soon as possible. ""the rulers are also of the view that state legislative assemblies can reconvene soon,"" the statement added. but they clearly understood their roles in a constitutional monarchy, rulers cannot encroach into politics.  meaning, rulers cannot force parliament to meet, and neither could they fix a date.  this has to come from the prime minister. still, it would not be wrong to say that some of the rulers have not been happy with political developments in the country. the key words in their statement, which some media missed or felt it was not important, were this ""the rulers concur that lives and livelihood must be given priority above other matters. ""by that, it meant the endless politicking by politicians, as well. one or two have privately expressed their disdain at the level of political manoeuvring, attempts at power grab and push for an immediate general election. mr syed danial said the rulers agreed that the political temperature in the country needed to be brought down, and that it was important to have a stable government which has the support and confidence of the majority of the people. ""the rulers concur that lives and livelihoods must be given priority above other matters and for the vaccination drive to be ramped up by minimising bureaucracy, so that 80 per cent of the population can be inoculated to achieve the targeted herd immunity quickly,"" he said.  he added that the rulers also wanted measures to tackle the covid-19 pandemic to be inclusive and involve various stakeholders. while the rulers merely said that parliament should meet ""as soon as possible"", they are also well aware of the provisions, in that the speaker must give a minimum 28 days notice. this means, for example, if the dewan rakyat (parliament) were to convene on aug 28, the notice must go out by aug 1. upon receiving the notice from the pm, the secretary of the house would then proceed. the members of parliament must be given 10 working days to submit questions and at least 14 days for any motions. there will also be a need to facilitate travelling plans of mps to gather including flights, as the country is still imposing a ban on inter-state and inter-district travels. since it is possible that this meet of mps would be a new session, the pm would then has to seek the advice of the king on his availability as he would need to address parliament, as is done every start of the annual parliamentary meeting.  august is also the national day month. but there is also a provision which stipulates that the pm can call for a special meeting of the parliament by merely writing to the speaker to inform him of the need. in this case, it is for a specific reason, and the pm will decide on the agenda.  it would most likely be a short meeting and almost certainly, would be criticised by mps. so, when (prime minister) tan sri muhyiddin yassin suggested that parliament can only convene in september or october, he was not far off the mark, but he has come under fire because he did not explain the rationale behind it. given the stand made by the rulers, the pm can perhaps expedite the date and at the same time, meet the requirements of the parliament rules. finally, mr muhyiddin could have explained better why he suggested that the meeting should be in september or october. not many malaysians including reporters who do not cover the parliament beat would understand the requirements. in short the pm cannot decide by saying, let's meet next week. it isn't a meeting at the kopi tiam or the spa. but as the rulers rightly pointed out, the political temperature needs to be brought down and a stable government that has the support of the people. the rulers were very clear at the meeting: parliament is the base of the people and for a democracy to function properly, the mps must go back to the august house. the challenge now is to see how many of these mps would be able to participate intelligently in the debates without the theatrics. we do not need any more shouting matches, walk-outs and name calling. that is what the rakyat (people) hates most. â¢ datuk seri wong chun wai is a columnist with the star.  he is adviser and former editor in chief of malaysia's star media group. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright Â© 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-17,Xi picks Vice Premier Liu He to oversee China's chipmaking push: Report.,"beijing: vice premier liu he, china's economic czar, has been tapped to spearhead the development of so-called third-generation chip production and lead the formulation of policy support for the technology, bloomberg news reported on thursday (jun 17), citing sources. liu is also overseeing projects that could lead to breakthroughs in traditional chipmaking, bloomberg said, citing one of the sources whom it did not name. liu, a confidante of president xi jinping, already holds a huge portfolio ranging from economics to finance.  he has also been the chief negotiator in sino-us trade talks since the days of former us president donald trump. about us$1 trillion of government funding has been set aside under the technology initiative, part of which will be used by central and local governments to jointly invest in a series of third-generation chip projects, bloomberg reported. china's state council and ministry of industry and information technology did not immediately respond to faxed requests for comment. earlier this month, the us senate approved a sweeping package of legislation intended to boost the country's ability to compete with chinese technology, drawing indignation from china, which objected to being cast as an ""imaginary"" us enemy. the measure authorises about us$190 billion for provisions to strengthen us technology and research and would separately approve spending us$54 billion to increase us production and research into semiconductors and telecommunications equipment, including us$2 billion dedicated to chips used by automakers that have seen massive shortages and caused significant production cuts. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-17,The Enchantress: Has Marvel's Loki Episode 2 Secretly Introduced Another Major Villain?.,"southeast asiawarning: this article contains spoilers for loki: episode 2! be sure to check out ign's review for episode 2!the first two episodes of loki have certainly been eventful.  they've introduced the multiverse-busting time variance authority, established a brand new status quo for this loki variant and even debuted a second version of loki played by sophia di martino.  but is di martino actually playing a female version of loki, or could she be a different marvel villain entirely? the answer isn't as clear cut as you might think. read on to learn why many fans are beginning to speculate this character is actually the enchantress. eagle-eyed marvel fans have spotted evidence di martino's character may actually be the enchantress.  whereas this character is generally listed as ""the variant"" in the end credits, the castilian spanish dub instead lists the role as ""sylvie. "" that also happens to be the first name of the second marvel character to call herself enchantress, sylvie lushton. lending further fuel to that fire, imdb lists the walking dead actress cailey fleming as playing ""young sylvie"" in episode 4.  this all suggests di martino's character isn't simply loki under a different form, but a unique person with her own identity separate from that of loki laufeyson. there's also the fact that enchantress is a character known for wearing green costumes with blond hair, which clearly sums up lady loki's fashion sense. none of this is to say that di martino isn't still playing a female version of loki.  if anything, this character is most likely inspired by the lady loki of the comics with elements of the sylvie lushton version of enchantress thrown in for good measure.  the blond hair may be a telltale sign of that blending.  this wouldn't be the first time marvel studios has borrowed aspects of the enchantress without including the character outright.  in the comics, amora is rarely seen without her faithful protector, skurge the executioner, by her side.  just as amora pines after thor, skurge harbors an unrequited love for her.  but in thor: ragnarok, skurge is reimagined as a reluctant bodyguard to hela (a character who herself is altered to become thor and loki's sister).  in short, the mcu has a habit of streamlining and tweaking the familiar thor mythos.  it's also worth pointing out that marvel already introduced an enchantress-like character in the first season of agents of shield.  elena satine plays lorelei, an asgardian character with similar powers of enchantment.  in the comics, lorelei is actually amora's sister, though that family connection isn't referenced in the show.  plus, there's the whole issue of whether agents of shield is still considered to be part of the mcu canon. . . based on the events of loki episode 2, we're meant to assume di martino is playing a version of loki from an alternate timeline, or potentially a future version of tom hiddleston's loki.  it's entirely possible this loki has a different backstory.  perhaps she was cast out of asgard and forced to live among humans, hence her taking up the sylvie lushton name.  episode 4's young sylvie sequence may show us that tragic story.  that life among humans might have profoundly affected her outlook on the universe and inspired what is clearly contempt for her male counterpart.  it's worth remembering that even if di martino turns out to be playing a hybrid lady loki/enchantress character, none of this necessarily prevents marvel studios from introducing a more traditional version of enchantress in a future thor movie.  amora could still be biding her time before emerging to cast a spell over asgard. for more, check out the loki release schedule, dig in on how loki evolved from marvel villain to agent of chaos in the comics, and check out some kang the conqueror theories. jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for ign.  allow him to lend a machete to your intellectual thicket by following @jschedeen on twitter.

launching in singapore on june 21, food delivery platform grabfood is preparing for high demand by offering its riders incentives. mcdonald's singapore officially confirmed the date when the bts meal would be available on its menu. a simple announcement of ""dropping 21 jun, 2021"" could be found on its website with ""more news coming soon"". photo: taken from mcdonald's websiteit appears that the bts meal will be made available for a limited time only at participating mcdonald's outlets. mcdonald's announced that the meal would be available through delivery only. the bts meal, consisting of 10-piece mcnuggets, accompanying cajun and sweet chilli sauces, a medium coca-cola and medium fries, was initially scheduled to be launched on may 27.  but the launch was postponed due to an increasing number of covid-19 cases within the community. malaysia was the first country in asia to launch the bts meal on may 26. meanwhile, the launch in indonesia on jun 9 saw a frenzy in orders leading to closures of at least 13 mcdonald's outlets. the delay in its singapore launch has only increased the excitement of bts fans, who call themselves army. grabfood delivery riders are being offered incentives to meet the expected high demand. grabfood announced on june 18 that it would be giving out an extra s$3 for every two bts meals delivered on june 21 and 22. the amount will be added to the s$5 to s$7 that a rider usually earns for a trip delivering food. according to a screenshot of the announcement posted on a facebook page, the incentive will be on a first come, first served basis with limited slots only. photo: fb screengrabgrabfood also revealed that the bts meal would be available for order on monday (june 21) at 11 am. /tisgread related: mcdonald's bts meal

2021-06-17,"Hong Kong police raid newspaper Apple Daily, arrest 5 including editor-in-chief.","hong kong: hong kong police arrested five executives at the apple daily early thursday (jun 17) morning, including its editor-in-chief ryan law. it was the second time in less than a year that the newspaper's office had been raided. more than 500 police officers were involved in thursday's operation, which authorities said was sparked by articles apple daily had published ""appealing for sanctions"" against hong kong's and china's leaders. police officers were seen sitting at computers in the newsroom after entering with a warrant to seize journalistic materials, including from reporters' phones and laptops. the warrant, which police said was aimed at gathering evidence for a case involving the national security law that beijing imposed last year, raises further concerns about media freedom in the city. officials said the five executives were arrested for collusion with a foreign country or external elements ""to endanger national security"". ""they have overall responsibility for the content, style and principles of news reporting,"" senior superintendent steve li told reporters. authorities confirmed hk$18 million (us$2. 3 million) in apple daily assets had also been frozen under the security law, the first time a seizure order has been made directly against a hong kong media company, rather than an individual. police officers gather outside the headquarters of apple daily in hong kong, jun 17, 2021.  (apple daily via ap)security secretary john lee described the newsroom as a ""crime scene"" and said the operation was aimed at those who use reporting as a ""tool to endanger"" national security. ""we are talking about a conspiracy in which these suspects try to make use of journalistic work to collude with a foreign country or external elements to impose sanctions or take hostile activities against hong kong and . . .  china,"" lee said. he did not elaborate on which articles the police action was taking aim at. ""it is your choice whether you will regard them as part of you who go about your journalistic work lawfully and properly,"" he told reporters. senior superintendent li said the tabloid published dozens of reports dating back to 2019 that ""incited foreign countries to impose sanctions"", without saying when the most recent articles in question were. the legislation is not retrospective but prosecutors can use actions from before its implementation as evidence. the united kingdom said the raid showed that china was using the national security law to target dissent rather than deal with public security. ""today's raids and arrests at apple daily in hong kong demonstrate beijing is using the national security law to target dissenting voices, not tackle public security,"" british foreign secretary dominic raab said. ""freedom of the press is one of the rights china promised to protect in the joint declaration and should be respected,"" he said. 'blatant attack'the five people arrested were editor-in-chief ryan law, chief executive officer cheung kim-hung, chief operating officer chow tat-kuen, deputy chief editor chan puiman and chief executive editor cheung chi-wai. ""this is a blatant attack on the editorial side of apple daily.  they are arresting editors.  they're arresting the top editorial folks,"" mark simon, an adviser to jimmy lai, told reuters. the tabloid's billionaire owner lai, 73, was charged with collusion after hundreds of officers searched the paper's newsroom last august.  he is currently serving multiple jail sentences for attending various protests. the paper broadcast live footage of the police raid on thursday on its facebook account.  officers could be seen cordoning off the complex and walking through the building. ""they arrived around 7am this morning, our building is besieged,"" an unnamed reporter said in a live commentary with the broadcast.  ""now we can see them moving boxes of materials onto their truck. """"police are restricting us from using quite a lot of our equipment.  but we can still keep this live camera on and our website will keep updating,"" the voice added. chief editor law was seen walking in handcuffs, flanked by police officers.  the apple daily paper's general news desk told reporters in a text message seen by reuters to carry on with their assignments outside the building for the time being. the move is the latest blow to apple daily after authorities last month directed lai's shares in next digital, publisher of the newspaper, to be frozen. the union representing apple daily's journalists described the operation as a ""wanton violation of press freedom"" that ""displayed how much police power has inflated under the national security law"". in an interview with afp last month, law struck a defiant tone.  he admitted that the paper was in ""crisis"" since the jailing of its owner lai but said his reporters were determined to press on with publishing. at a recent townhall meeting, staff members asked law what they should do if the police came back to arrest him. he had a simple reply: ""broadcast it live.

2021-06-17,Kim Jong-un admits North Korea facing a 'tense' food shortage.,"north korean leader kim jong-un has formally acknowledged that his country is facing food shortages.  addressing a meeting of senior leaders, mr kim said: ""the people's food situation is now getting tense"".  he said the agricultural sector had failed to meet its grain targets due to typhoons last year, which caused flooding. there are reports that food prices have spiked, with nk news reporting that a kilogram of bananas costs $45 (Ã¢Â£32). north korea has closed its borders to contain the spread of covid-19.  trade with china has plummeted as a result.  north korea relies on china for food, fertiliser and fuel.  north korea is also struggling under international sanctions, imposed because of its nuclear programmes.  the authoritarian leader of the single-party state talked about the food situation at the ruling workers' party central committee which started this week in the capital pyongyang. during the meeting, mr kim said that national industrial output had grown by a quarter compared to the same period last year. officials were expected to discuss relations with the us and south korea during the event but no details have been released yet. in april, mr kim made a a rare admission of looming hardship, calling on officials to ""wage another, more difficult 'arduous march' in order to relieve our people of the difficulty, even a little"". the arduous march is a term used by north korea officials to refer to the country's struggle during the 1990s famine, when the fall of the soviet union left north korea without crucial aid.  the total number of north koreans who starved to death at the time is not known, but estimates range up to three million. it is highly unusual for kim jong-un to publicly acknowledge a food shortage.  but this is a north korean leader who has already admitted that his economic plan has failed.  the problem for mr kim is that when he took over from his father, he promised his people a more prosperous future.  he said they would have meat on their tables and access to electricity.  this has not happened.  now he's having to prime the population for more hard work.  he is trying to tie this into the global pandemic, and state media reported that he pointed out to party officials that the situation across the world is getting ""worse and worse"".  with so little access to outside information, he can paint a picture of things being bad everywhere not just in sealed off north korea.  he also described efforts to beat covid-19 as a ""protracted war"".  that signals that border closures are not easing any time soon.  that is the concern of many aid organisations.  the sealed border has prevented some food and medicine getting through.  most ngos have had to leave the country, unable to get staff and supplies in or out. pyongyang has always called for ""self-reliance"".  it has closed itself off, just as it may need assistance and it is unlikely to ask for help.  if it continues to push away all offers of international assistance, as ever, it may be the people who pay the price.  n korea's kim warns of crisis amid famine threatthe south koreans enslaved in the north's minesnorth korea's missile and nuclear programmenorth korea claims 'new' missiles testedhow trump offered kim a ride on air force oneus supreme court upholds affordable healthcare lawthe law, known as obamacare, gives millions of low-income americans access to medical insurance. first crew blasts off to new china space stationdecoding biden and putin's body language.  videodecoding biden and putin's body languagewhy cyber gangs won't worry about us-russia talksthe relatives frozen in time on google street view'i walked three days to find a hospital for my son'covid threat to india's holiest river.  videocovid threat to india's holiest riverthe vast european mine infuriating the neighboursdecoding biden and putin's body language.  videodecoding biden and putin's body languagewhat's going on in iran's election?Ã¢ÂÂmindset shiftingÃ¢ÂÂ as more australians ditch boozebbc worklife: the myth of a new digital-nomad movementfootball phrases15 sayings from around the worldus supreme court upholds affordable healthcare law1outrage in italy after cable car crash video aired2kim jong-un admits north korea food concerns3rugby star called 'prostitute' in website blunder4arena bomber 'should have been identified as threat'5Ã¢ÂÂmindset shiftingÃ¢ÂÂ as more australians ditch booze6boatman praised for saving baby floating in river7first crew blasts off to new china space station8the vast european mine infuriating the neighbours9jeff bezos-backed fusion plant to be built in uk10Ã¢Â© 2021 bbc.  the bbc is not responsible for the content of external sites.  read about our approach to external linking.

""there's been only three other (wreck) sites with yuan blue-and-white porcelain anywhere in the world, and in much smaller quantities,"" he said, adding that it was clear from the primary cargo of both vessels chinese ceramics that they were loaded in china. the shah munchah wreck site yielded a much wider range of artefacts, from instruments to cannon. the heaviest finds were four anchors as long as 5m and weighing 2. 5 tonnes each and nine cannon, which required a crane vessel to remove them from the seabed. 
a diver holds a bowl decorated with chinese characters, recovered from the deep part of a trove of items found in singapore waters off pedra branca from two shipwrecks, one with cargo dating to as early as the 14th century.  among the items were the largest haul from a shipwreck of blue-and-white ceramics from the yuan dynasty.  the first wreck was discovered after commercial divers carrying out unrelated salvage works stumbled upon several ceramic plates, which they passed to the iseas yusof ishak institute as they bore an uncanny resemblance to artefacts they had seen in the news.  the institute dated the plates to the 14th century, and this kick-started an excavation project in 2016, the national heritage board (nhb) and iseas said yesterday.  a survey of the area around pedra branca in 2019 revealed the second wreck, identified as the india-built merchant vessel shah munchah, which sank in 1796.  the two historical shipwrecks are the first to be found in singapore's waters, and will contribute to a better understanding of the nation's maritime past.  photo: iseas yusof ishak institute
artefacts are currently being stored at facilities managed by both nhb and iseas, where they will be cleaned, conserved and catalogued. the two historical shipwrecks are the first to be found within singapore's waters, and will contribute to a better understanding of the nation's maritime past. there's been only three other (wreck) sites with yuan blue-and-white porcelain anywhere in the world, and in much smaller quantities. as there were no claims to the wrecks and their artefacts at the end of the stipulated notice period of a month, they have been claimed by singapore. although it is very likely there are more wrecks on the seabed in singapore's waters, some of these have been covered by reclamation, while heavy maritime traffic in the singapore strait makes locating others a hazard. nhb's director of heritage research and assessment yeo kirk siang said: ""as an island that has been serving as the gateway to asia for centuries, singapore today is the legacy of our rich maritime heritage. ""we will continue to research the significance of the artefacts and find ways to promote the knowledge, so as to enable more people to learn about them and singapore's maritime history.

""our website and other internet-based tools are back up and running today after a brief outage late wednesday evening,"" southwest spokesperson said in a statement.  ""we are continuing to look into the root cause of last night's outage but it's believed to be related to the broad akamai outage. ""american airlines, united airlines and delta air lines were not immediately available for comment. hong kong exchanges & clearing and australia's central bank also went down briefly thursday in the second global internet outage in as many weeks.  some of the outages, including those that affected commonwealth bank of australia, westpac banking corp and australia & new zealand banking group were linked to a failure at akamai technologies, which helps clients manage web services, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified discussing internal affairs. the reserve bank of australia was forced to cancel a scheduled bond-buying operation thursday, blaming ""technical difficulties"". a representative for akamai in asia didn't respond to emails and calls seeking comment, bloomberg reported.  the widespread downtime recalled an hour-long global outage earlier this month, triggered by a software failure at content delivery platform fastly that affected services from amazon. com to shopify and stripe. in thursday's incident, issues appeared to be more prolonged in australia where problems hit in the mid-afternoon as much of the rest of the world slept with services only slowly returning an hour after the first reports. a spokesman for anz bank told agence france-presse that the incident was ""related to an external provider"" but that ""connectivity was restored quickly and the most impacted services are back online"". commonwealth bank told afp that it and many of the country's major banks had been affected. westpac and me bank also reported problems with their mobile apps or online banking products, while customers for st george and several regional banks reported they were down too. the outages began around 2. 10pm sydney time (12. 10pm singapore time) and did not appear to be limited to the banking sector. virgin australia airline said it was ""one of many organisations to experience an outage with the akamai content delivery system,"" though the situation was now resolved. australia post, the country's postal service, said some services were hit by an ""external outage"". a series of high profile hack-for-ransom attacks have also left corporations around the world jittery over cybersecurity risks, although there was no indication the latest problems were caused by malicious actors. colonial pipeline was briefly shuttered after an attack in may, and jbs, the world's largest meat producer, was forced to stop operations in the united states and australia. both firms reportedly paid ransom to get operations back up and running. the issue of cybersecurity was at the top of the agenda when us president joe biden and his russian counterpart vladimir putin met in geneva this week. washington believes hackers who have extorted hundreds of millions of dollars from western governments, companies, and organisations operate from russian soil. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright Â© 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-17,Re/insurers on edge as Tokyo Olympics nears: Bloomberg.,"
reinsurance news 16th june 2021 author: katie bakerre/insurers are expected to be on edge over the next six weeks as the tokyo olympics' opening nears, according to bloomberg intelligence. after much deliberation, the international olympic committee (ioc) has decided to go ahead with the postponed 2020 olympics. however, the ioc has taken out around $800 million in event-cancellation insurance, with additional cover purchased by the local organising committee. including broadcasters, sponsors, professional sports teams and hospitality, analysis from bloomberg intelligence estimate the insured cost of cancelling the event to be in the $2-$3 billion range. with the olympic games set to begin at the end of next month, insurance losses could be large if the games are cancelled, as japan faces emergency measures to contain covid-19 infections. swiss re said last year that its direct olympic exposure was $250 million (or about 1% of net-earned premiums) and munich re hasn't specified, but it likely has exposure in the hundreds of millions of euros, some of which may already have been reserved. charles graham, senior industry analyst at bloomberg intelligence says: ""insurers and reinsurers will be on tenterhooks over the next six weeks as the tokyo olympics' opening nears, with any cancellation of the already postponed 2020 event potentially costing the sector $2-$3 billion in aggregate, based on our calculations.  that would hit an event-cancellation industry already battered by record 2020 claims. ""according to the latest polls, opposition in japan to holding the olympic games may be easing after the number of covid-19 cases dropped. medical opinion remains strongly opposed to the games taking place, with reports that japanese corporate sponsors also favoured a postponement after international spectators were excluded. the ioc is focused on making the games as safe as possible, with plans for daily testing and the vaccination of athletes, yet vaccination won't be compulsory.  a decision on allowing spectators into venues will be taken later this month. by submitting the form you are giving your consent to be emailed by us. advertise on reinsurance newswe have 185,000+ monthly reinsurance news readers & 15,500+ daily email subscribers.  reach the largest reinsurance audience.

2021-06-17,"Centuries-old shipwrecks discovered in S'pore waters; artefacts to be displayed in museums, Singapore News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore two shipwrecks one dating possibly to the 14th century and the other to the 18th have been excavated within singapore's waters a first for the nation and a ground-breaking development for its maritime heritage. both wrecks, bearing chinese ceramics as their primary cargo, were found in the waters off pedra branca, a rocky outcrop surrounded by shallow waters where ships throughout history have come to grief. the plan is to display the artefacts in museums here from the end of this year. maritime archaeologist michael flecker, who supervised both excavations, described the first wreck as a ""pretty remarkable"" find, as it is contemporary with the temasek period that spans the 1300s to 1600s. while research may never reveal the exact vessel that sank, as no remnants of its hull remain, the second wreck has been identified as the india-built merchant vessel shah munchah.  it sank in 1796 as it was returning to india from china.  it all started with an accident. a singapore-registered barge carrying two bulk loader cranes encountered bad weather while on its way to kuantan and ran aground at pedra branca on dec 30, 2014. the two cranes were at risk of toppling onto pedra branca's famous horsburgh lighthouse, which was built in 1851. to prevent this from happening, dynamite was attached to the two cranes, and they were blown up while two boats pulled them away from the lighthouse, scattering metal into the sea. commercial divers were then hired to clear the area of these scraps. it was while diving to retrieve the scraps in 2015 that mr ramdzan salim, a project manager, and mr ahmad qamarulhazman, a diver, stumbled across stacks of old ceramic plates, said dr michael flecker, a visiting fellow at the iseas yusof ishak institute's archaeology unit.  at around the same time, a 10-week-long archaeological dig was being carried out at a site in empress place. the divers, while following media coverage of the findings, realised that some plates retrieved near pedra branca looked very similar to artefacts retrieved in empress place, and decided to hand over the plates to the institute for further research and safekeeping.

upon the institute's confirmation that the plates were high-quality celadon ceramics dated to the 14th century, the national heritage board (nhb) partnered the institute to conduct a survey at the pedra branca site, discovering a shipwreck in 2016. following the end of excavation works for the first shipwreck, nhb and iseas conducted a survey around pedra branca and uncovered a second shipwreck dating to the late 18th century.  efforts were then made to excavate this shipwreck between 2019 and 2021. the first wreck was located about 100m north-west of the island, the nhb and iseas announced on wednesday (june 16).  the second wreck was found 300m east of pedra branca. in an interview with the straits times about the historic finds, dr flecker said various chinese ceramics formed a large majority of the haul from the first wreck, with some matching those previously excavated in mainland singapore. for instance, longquan greenware dishes from the first wreck match those that had been unearthed earlier at fort canning, with both bearing a double fish motif. ""from fort canning, there is a plate that is so similar you might almost be tempted to think they used the same stamp (to produce the motif),"" said dr flecker, a visiting fellow at iseas. while research is ongoing, dr flecker said the find would be especially significant if it could be proven that the vessel was going to call at singapore something he believes to be true. ceramics from the wreck are also similar to those excavated at empress place in 2015, and more research will be done to improve existing knowledge on maritime trading history in the region during the 14th century. dr flecker, who has more than 30 years of maritime archaeology experience, added that the yuan blue-and-white ceramic haul from the first wreck is also the largest that has been recovered from a shipwreck to date. ""there's only been three other (wreck) sites with yuan blue-and-white porcelain anywhere in the world, and in much smaller quantities,"" he said, adding that it was clear from the primary cargo of both vessels chinese ceramics that they were loaded in china. the shah munchah wreck site yielded a much wider range of artefacts, from instruments to cannon. among the surprising finds were percussion instruments, including a tambourine and a coconut shaker with a handle, said dr flecker. wooden frame parasols, metal betel nut cutters and a myriad of figurines were also retrieved by divers. 
the shah munchah wreck site yielded a wider range of artefacts, including glass bottle stopper, metal betal nut cutters, medallions and figurines.  photos: iseas yusof ishak institute
the heaviest finds were four anchors as long as 5m and weighing 2. 5 tonnes each and nine cannon, which required a craned vessel to remove them from the seabed. dr flecker said the anchors were designed in the admiralty style, adding: ""they are suitable for very large sailing vessels so it's a good find and it's well worth getting them up for conservation. ""the nine cannon, which dr flecker described as a ""representative set"" of what was used then, were typically mounted on ships employed by the east india company in the 18th and early 19th centuries, and used for defence as well as signalling.

artefacts are currently being stored at facilities managed by both nhb and iseas, where they will be cleaned, conserved and catalogued. about the shah munchah, dr flecker said: ""had she survived another 23 years, she would almost certainly have called at the re-established port of singapore. ""her incredibly diverse cargo provides great insights into the type of goods that would have been exchanged and purchased by the new inhabitants of this fledgling city. ""

the two historical shipwrecks are the first to be found within singapore's waters, and will contribute to a better understanding of the nation's maritime past.  as there were no claims to the wrecks and their artefacts at the end of the stipulated notice period of a month, they have been claimed by singapore. although it is very likely there are more wrecks on the seabed in singapore's waters, some of these have been covered by reclamation, while heavy maritime traffic in the singapore strait makes locating others a hazard. nhb's director of heritage research and assessment yeo kirk siang said: ""as an island that has been serving as the gateway to asia for centuries, singapore today is the legacy of our rich maritime heritage. 
in a storage facility, encrustations are removed from an artefact.  iseas yusof ishak institute
""we will continue to research the significance of the artefacts and find ways to promote the knowledge, so as to enable more people to learn about them and singapore's maritime history. ""nhb plans to display the artefacts in museums here from the end of this year, while iseas will likely publish findings progressively in reports and research papers. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright Â© 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

as it is contemporary with the temasek period that spans the 1300s to 1600s.', 'while research may never reveal the exact vessel that sank, as no remnants of its hull remain, the second wreck has been

two bulk loader cranes encountered bad weather while on its way to kuantan and ran aground at pedra branca on dec 30, 2014. the two cranes were at risk of toppling onto pedra branca's famous horsburgh

metal into the sea."", 'commercial divers were then hired to clear the area of these scraps.', ""it was while diving to retrieve the scraps in 2015 that mr ramdzan salim, a project manager, and mr

the first wreck match those that had been unearthed earlier at fort canning, with both bearing a double fish motif.', '""from fort canning, there is a plate that is so similar you might almost be

2021-06-17,Football: Bale the provider at the beating heart of a Welsh dragon.,"baku: gareth bale skied a penalty over the bar, and extended his international goal drought to 13 games, but in every other respect his contribution towales' 2-0 group a defeat of turkeyat euro 2020 on wednesday (jun 16) was immense. the goals may not be flowing but the captain was the provider who set up aaron ramsey and connor roberts with the sort of precision passing and persistence that made all the difference. it would be easy to characterise wales as a team who rely heavily on the real madrid winger, however much of a shift they all put in, but bale's link up play with ramsey and his vision stood out. ""it's unfortunate, but what he did show was character after it,"" wales manager rob page said of the shocking penalty miss in baku. ""everybody's going to make mistakes, everybody's going to miss chances.  ok, he missed a penalty.  so what?""he got on with it.  he's got man of the match tonight.  he plays a massive part as a captain and he's a big, big part of what we want to do. ""when juventus midfielder ramsey scored the 42nd minute opener it was the third great chance he had been fed through by bale. roberts' extra time icing on the cake came after bale dribbled along the byline and then slipped the ball through at an angle. barely 10 minutes into the match he had cleared away a corner in the welsh area and then secured one at the other end on the counter-attack.  his shots on goal, like the penalty that he won, came to nothing. turkey had 56 per cent of the ball, more attempts on goal and completed way more passes but were vulnerable in defence and, despite welsh nerves, offered little real threat on the attack.  they had the crowd in baku but have yet to score a point. possession has never been a secret of wales' success, their players lifted by a strong and indefatigable sense of team spirit. in ramsey and bale, the euro 2016 semi-finalists have two players who can stand with the best but wales are much more than that as a unit and their fans will be dreaming of another mazy run in the knockout stages. ""we're not little wales, we're not viewed like that any more,"" said former wales striker and manager mark hughes, in the bbc studio as a pundit, after a game that left them with four points from two games. italy, who beat turkey 3-0, are still to come in the final game of the group but wednesday's performance will give wales plenty of belief that they can take something away from it. ""i thought that first half today was superb,"" said ramsey.  ""to a man we created so many opportunities and we really dominated the play. ""second half we showed great character, we dug in and i thought we thoroughly deserved the win at the end. . .  what we've built our success on over the last few years is really working hard for each other and we showed it again tonight.

2021-06-17,Yaâakov Finkelstein writes: The Hamas uses civilians as shields in attacks against Israel.,"during the muslim holy month of ramadan, a time traditionally dedicated for peace, reconciliation and forgiveness, hamas terrorists fired around 4,000 rockets from gaza, directed at innocent civilians in israel.  twelve people fell victim to these attacks.  among them were jews and muslims, women and children.  more than 70 per cent of israel's population was living under the shadow of hundreds of rockets every day.  depending on their distance from gaza, they had between 15 seconds to one minute to find shelter.  just imagine 70 per cent of indians living that kind of life for two weeks.  surely, india, like every other country, and like israel, would have exercised its legal right to defend its citizens from terror. the reason for sharing these facts â plain numbers are often used to blame israel for allegedly committing war crimes by punitively attacking gaza without caring for civilian casualties.  every war is tragic.  every person's death is a world lost.  it's sad when children die in such armed conflicts.  one common misconception in public perception relating to armed conflicts is the term ""proportionality"".  the number of casualties on each side is compared in order to deduce which side used force disproportionately.  from a legal standpoint, this notion is completely legally flawed, and indeed, illogical. the universally accepted principle of proportionality is defined as the obligation to refrain from any attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss or injuries to civilians, or damage to civilian objects.  the proportionality principle essentially means that before every military strike, the military commanders must assess two factors. first, they must examine the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated from an attack, when naturally, the neutralisation of some targets would have a higher advantage than others.  first, in order to offer such an advantage, the target must be a military one, such as a weapons depot, a command and control centre or the adversary's armed forces.  importantly, a seemingly civilian object, used by the adversary for military purposes may be considered a lawful target. second, the commanders must assess, based on reasonably available information at the time of the attack, the expected incidental loss of civilian life or property (collateral damage).  the military commander assesses how many civilians, if any, will be present in the area of the planned attack.  then, they assess the extent of the expected damage to civilian property, including the indirect damage that is to be accounted for, as long as it is reasonably expected.  lastly, the military commander must implement all feasible precautions to mitigate harm to civilians and civilian objects. based on these assessments, the commander must balance these two components and decide whether to carry out the attack.  if the assessment leads to the conclusion that the expected damage to civilians or civilian objects is deemed excessive in relation to the anticipated military advantage, the attack would be unlawful. how is this principle of proportionality affected when instead of protecting its civilians, hamas intentionally conducts its military activity from within densely populated areas? to be more precise, how is israel expected to protect its major cities from hamas rockets, when these rockets are developed, built and launched from within the gazan civilian population?the law of armed conflict clearly states that when civilian presence is used to shield military objectives from attacks, that presence does not grant the target immunity.  that is, when hamas commits the double war crime of attacking israeli children, schools and airports from within its own civilian population, the analysis of the situation would be distorted if hamas' criminal behaviour is not taken into account. despite hamas's blatant disregard for the law or its citizen's wellbeing, israel does everything feasible in order to prevent or at least minimise the harm to the palestinian civilian population, often at the cost of operational advantage.  in doing so, israel employs precautions that exceed the requirements of international law, as well as the practices commonly employed by advanced militaries of western states.  fighting an enemy that deliberately abuses the law of armed conflict in the most cynical way creates grave challenges for israeli soldiers.  nevertheless, israeli commanders strictly apply international law, including the principle of proportionality in every military action. one must ask why hamas uses its own population as human shields? the answer brings us back to the beginning of this article â the miscomprehension of the concept of proportionality, and the knee-jerk reaction that ignores the question who put gazan civilians in danger in the first place? in other words, hamas pays no price for its war crimes against its own civilians, and, indeed, often israel is wrongfully blamed by the very same terrorist organisation.  this situation provides an incentive to hamas to continue with its heinous practices. hamas is internationally recognised as a radical islamic terror organisation.  its ultimate goal, which is clearly specified in its charter, is not to establish a palestinian state, but rather to destroy israel.  in 2006, when hamas won elections in palestinian territories, they refused to respect the existing written agreements between israel and the palestinian leadership, committing to non-violent dialogue and recognition of israel.  hamas forcefully and violently seized power in gaza and diverted billions of dollars of aid meant for building schools, hospitals and civic amenities to build terror tunnels and rockets meant for destroying israel.  hamas is committing a double war crime â deliberately targeting israeli civilians and endangering gazan civilians by using them as human shields.  at the same time, hamas is engaged in a misinformation campaign to provoke palestinians and israeli arabs.  the absurdness of their propaganda is obvious: israel has normalised relations with five muslim countries in the last one year, adding to its historic peace agreements with egypt and jordan.  israel's commitment to peace is clear to countries like sudan, morocco, uae, bahrain and others.  let's hope it will be the same also for our immediate neighbours, the palestinians. this

2021-06-17,"Xi Jinping picks top lieutenant Liu He to lead China's chip battle against US, East Asia News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. beijing (bloomberg) chinese president xi jinping is renewing his years-long push to achieve technology self-sufficiency by tapping a top deputy to shepherd a key initiative aimed at helping domestic chipmakers overcome us sanctions. mr liu he, mr xi's economic czar whose sprawling portfolio spans trade to finance and technology, has been tapped to spearhead the development of so-called third-generation chip development and capabilities and is leading the formulation of a series of financial and policy supports for the technology, according to people with knowledge of the matter. it's a nascent field that relies on newer materials and gear beyond traditional silicon and is currently an arena where no company or nation yet dominates, offering beijing one of its best chances to sidestep the hurdles slapped on its chipmaking industry by the us and its allies. the sanctions, which emerged during mr donald trump's presidency, have already smothered huawei technologies co's smartphone business and will impede longer-term efforts by chipmakers from huawei's hisilicon to semiconductor manufacturing international corp to migrate toward more advanced wafer fabrication technologies, threatening china's technological ambitions. ""china is the world's largest user of chips, so supply chain security is of high priority,"" said mr gu wenjun, chief analyst at research firm icwise.  ""it's not possible for any country to control the entire supply chain, but a country's effort is definitely stronger than a single company. ""the involvement of one of mr xi's most-trusted lieutenants in china's chip efforts highlights the importance accorded by beijing to the initiative, which is gaining urgency as rivals from the us to japan and south korea scramble to shore up their own industries. the chinese president has long called upon his harvard-educated adviser to tackle matters of top national priority, making him the chief representative in trade negotiations with the us as well as chairman of the financial stability and development committee, where mr liu leads the charge to curb risks in the nation's us$5 trillion (s$6. 68 trillion) plus financial sector. in may, mr liu spearheaded a meeting of the technology task force that discussed ways to grow next-generation semiconductor technologies, according to a government statement. the 69-year-old vice-premier, who has led the country's technology reform task force since 2018, is also overseeing projects that could lead to breakthroughs in traditional chipmaking, including the development of china's own chip design software and extreme ultraviolet lithography machines, one of the people said, asking not to be identified as they weren't authorized to speak to media. the state council and the ministry of industry and information technology didn't respond to faxed requests for comment. during trade negotiations with the trump administration, mr liu emerged as one of the most visible advocates of beijing's agenda. he's known mr xi since childhood both are sons of veteran communist party leaders and were among masses of young people dispatched to work in impoverished rural areas during the cultural revolution. now, liu is leading the charge to reform the tech sector, which was identified in china's latest five-year economic plan as a key strategic area in which the ""whole nation system"" should be used to mobilise any necessary resources. first introduced under mao zedong to help the then-fledgling communist china industrialize, the approach was crucial to helping beijing attain a number of top national priorities, from developing its first atomic bomb in the early 1960s to achieving olympic sporting success. after that it was largely set aside as officials shifted to focus on economic growth.  but following a series of us sanctions that exposed the vulnerabilities of china's chip capabilities, mr xi is once again reactivating the mechanism to achieve breakthroughs in advanced chip development and manufacturing. about a trillion dollars of government funding have been set aside under the technology initiative, part of which will be used by central and local governments to jointly invest in a series of third-generation chip projects, according to people with knowledge of the matter. top chipmakers and research institutes have submitted proposals to the ministries of science and information technology, all vying for a place in the national programme and a share of the financing. the ministry of science and technology is slated to inject 400 million yuan (s$83. 23 million) into some key ""strategic electronics materials"" including third-generation chips, according to a government document. even moonshot chip programmes are in line for government funding.  the state-backed national natural science foundation of china has pledged financial support for dozens of exploratory research programmes, ranging from ultra-low power consumption to the development of a flexible chip that can collect and transmit nerve signals, as beijing seeks to overcome ""computing bottlenecks"" when moore's law the industry standard for predicting the pace of chip improvements finally stops working. several subsidiaries of china electronics technology group corp and china railway construction corp organisations already sanctioned by the u. s.  are among the state-backed firms backing the effort, one of the people said.  another government-linked giant, china electronics corp, is one of the leaders in third-generation chip development, thanks to its investment in smaller firms including cec semiconductor co. using its own in-house technology, cec semiconductor makes silicone carbide-based power devices that can work at 200 deg c for a number of key industries from telecommunications to electric cars reducing china's reliance on overseas suppliers such as infineon technologies ag, rohm co and cree inc. the task of coordinating that sprawling programme now falls to mr liu, who has to keep track of the relevant resources and drive the national strategy to help china achieve chip independence. ""for our country, technology and innovation is not just a matter of growth,"" mr liu told a three-story auditorium packed with china's top scientists in a separate meeting in may.  ""it's also a matter of survival. ""mr xi is counting on his lieutenant to help china fend off growing threats from the us, which is seeking to take back chip industry supremacy. under the trump administration, sanctions were slapped on chinese giants from huawei to smic, cutting off their access to american technology and equipment crucial to designing and making advanced logic chips. president joe biden has also laid out a us $52 billion plan to bolster domestic chip manufacturing, while calling on allies to join export controls aimed at curbing beijing's drive toward technology self-sufficiency. rival powerhouse nations like south korea and leading corporations such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co.  have also responded with their own spending plans, fuelling the race to take the lead in the sector. with traditional chipmaking facing a series of challenges from technology development to heavy capital investment, third-generation chips which use compounds such as gallium nitride and silicon carbide to significantly improve the performance of semiconductors that power a wide range of industries and products may offer china its best chance to overcome rivals, senior academic mao junfa told an industry event in nanjing earlier this month. ""china couldn't buy chips, even with cash in hand,"" he said, referring to washington's sanctions on chinese tech companies including huawei.  ""the compound chip technologies could help china surpass rivals in the post-moore's law era.

2021-06-17,2 historic shipwrecks and their artefacts found in Singapore's territorial waters.,"singapore: two historic shipwrecks and their artefacts â including chinese ceramics from as far back as the 14th century â have been discovered within singapore's territorial waters around pedra branca island, located at the easternmost point of singapore. in 2015, several ceramic plates were discovered by accident by commercial divers involved in a maritime operation, which led to the discovery of the first historic shipwreck about 100m to the north-west of pedra branca. one year later, the national heritage board (nhb) commissioned the archaeology unit of the iseas-yusof ishak institute (iseas) to survey and investigate the site, and to conduct excavations to recover wrecks and objects from the shipwreck. these excavations, which continued until 2019, led to the discovery of a second historic shipwreck about 300m east of pedra branca.  excavations to recover artefacts from the second shipwreck were carried out from 2019 until mid-2021. artefacts recoveredthe two shipwrecks originated from different periods, according to iseas' findings. the first shipwreck contained chinese ceramics and may date back to the 14th century, a time when singapore was known as temasek, the research stated. some of the key finds include longquan dishes and bowls, and a jarlet.  fragments of blue-and-white porcelain bowls with lotus and peony motifs from the yuan dynasty were also found in the shipwreck. this ship carried more of these blue-and-white porcelain than ""any other documented shipwreck in the world,"" said dr michael flecker, a visiting fellow and project director of maritime archaeology projects at iseas. ""many of the pieces are rare, and one is believed to be unique,"" he said. iseas' research also noted that direct parallels can be made between the finds from the first shipwreck and those from archaeological excavations at empress place conducted in 2015 and from past excavations at fort canning park. the second shipwreck, noted iseas' research, is likely to be the shah munchah, a merchant vessel that sank while voyaging from china back to india in 1796. artefacts recovered from this shipwreck include a range of chinese ceramics and non-ceramic artefacts, such as copper-alloy, glass sand agate objects, as well as four anchors and nine cannons of the ship.  the cannons were typically mounted on merchant ships employed by the east india company during the 18th and early 19th centuries, and used mostly for defensive purposes and signalling. among the key non-ceramic finds in the second shipwreck were a jar shard depicting a dragon motif; an earthenware duck; figurines of guanyin's head, happy buddha and a boy of good fortune; figurines of a dog and mythical sea creature makara; a figurine of a chinese couple holding fans on a biscuit base; and a qingbai figurine of a horse with a side-saddle rider. ""had the ship survived another 23 years, she would almost certainly have called at the re-established port of singapore.  her incredibly diverse cargo provides great insights into the type of goods that would have been exchanged and purchased by the new inhabitants of this fledging city,"" said dr flecker. next steps: conservation and historical significanceafter the removal of salt via the process of desalination, the artefacts have to be meticulously cleaned, conserved and catalogued.  in-depth research and documentation will also need to be carried out. once the conservation, research and documentation have been completed, nhb will work towards exhibiting the artefacts in its museums from end-2021. archaeological reports and research might also be published by iseas.  the institute might also conduct talks for members of the public. mr yeo kirk siang, director of nhb's heritage research and assessment, told cna that the discoveries are ""significant"" in unveiling singapore's history. ""what is significant about it is it unveils part of our history before 1819.  that part is little known so far.  with every find, it enriches our understanding.  singapore's history is clearly connected to our maritime trade â in the past and even today,"" he said. ""understanding our maritime history helps us understand singapore's relations, our context and our place in the world, our geographic location, why it's important, what's the reason for our existence, and what's the reason for our success.

""he had relied heavily and successfully on social networking platforms to reach out to individuals with the relevant expertise, knowledge and access.  he had pitched taskings to his resource persons as 'research topics' for his various foreign clients. ""the isd said it was unable to provide further details on the professions of these individuals or the number of persons involved. the agency also said that yeo had tried to gain employment in a range of positions in the public sector positions and agencies he believed would allow him access to information of interest to his foreign handlers.  it added that it could not provide specific details of these jobs, citing operational and security reasons. people looking to join the public sector in positions that require access to classified information will have to undergo security clearance, the isd said.  several factors are taken into consideration in this process, including the nature of the work and the sensitivity of the information dealt with. ""security checks will vary for different positions which have different levels of access to confidential information,"" the department added. yeo's path to being a spy started during a trip to beijing in 2015, when he was recruited by chinese agents who claimed to represent think-tanks.  he was studying for a doctorate at the lee kuan yew school of public policy (lkyspp) at the national university of singapore at the time. when news of yeo's activities broke after he pleaded guilty in a us court last july, the school terminated his phd candidature ""with immediate effect"". at the time, retired diplomat bilahari kausikan revealed that one of yeo's former professors at the school was huang jing until 2017, when the academic was expelled from singapore ""for being a chinese agent of influence"". on tuesday, an lkyspp spokesman said the past incidents involving its former staff member and former student show how different sectors in society, including education, can be potential targets for foreign subversion.  the best safeguard against illegal foreign subversion is a community that is aware and vigilant, she added. the spokesman stressed that the school will not tolerate any acts or activities of foreign interference that threaten singapore's national security or interests.  its staff and students are also expected to conduct themselves fully in accordance with the laws of singapore at all times. she added that the school has strengthened its procedures, saying: ""we maintain an enhanced oversight on academic collaborations and partnerships, both local and overseas, and will also continue to keep a heightened awareness among all our staff and students on the risks of foreign interference. ""professor joseph liow, dean of the college of humanities, arts and social sciences, and tan kah kee chair in comparative and international politics at nanyang technological university, said of yeo's activities: ""academics and researchers should be aware that these sorts of things happen in real life, and are not merely the stuff of spy novels or hollywood movies. ""foreign powers spy all the time, and spying is conducted in many ways, which have evolved with technology, he noted.  and one could say that by virtue of being a very open country, singapore is vulnerable to such activities, added prof liow. ""i wouldn't say that we have to be exceedingly worried about this, but we certainly need to be aware that such things take place, and also be alert to requests that appear unusual,"" he said. ""it's not happening on a daily basis, and of course our security agencies spend a lot of time making sure such activities don't take place.  but nevertheless as academics, researchers, or just regular citizens, we need to exercise some common sense and be vigilant.

2021-06-17,HK approves plan to ease cityâs strict travel quarantine.,"
                    thursday, 17 jun 2021
                travellers entering hong kong currently need to quarantine in a hotel for up to 21 days, even if they're fully vaccinated.  afphong kong (bloomberg): hong kong will shorten hotel quarantine for fully vaccinated travellers from most places to seven days as long as they pass an antibody test, people familiar with the matter said, easing a border policy which has been criticized by residents and the city's powerful finance industry for being among the strictest in the world. authorities are now trialling various antibody tests -- which are meant to confirm that a person has been vaccinated or has recovered from covid-19 -- like those that require a prick of the finger, said the people, who asked not to be identified as they're not authorised to speak publicly. there's been no decision on when the policy will take effect as it depends on when the testing facilities are ready, the people said.  those coming from ""high-risk"" locations where outbreaks are uncontrolled won't be included in the plan, said one of the people. places like the uk, us and japan are currently designated ""high risk, "" while six nations including india are judged ""extremely high risk,"" with travel banned from these locations.  the list is updated regularly. travelers entering hong kong currently need to quarantine in a hotel for up to 21 days, even if they're fully vaccinated. shortening that for some would be the city's most significant move yet to ease the stringent restrictions that have threatened its status as a financial hub as major western economies open up and vaccination pulls ahead in regional rival singapore. like a handful of other ""covid havens"" that have largely eliminated local transmission of the virus, hong kong has been struggling to find a path to reopen as the rules that allowed it to stamp out covid-19 increasingly become a straitjacket. the easing was first recommended by a government advisory panel earlier this month.  the city's food and health bureau didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. the current, 21-day rule has been a growing source of public anger.  travellers have to book their own hotel rooms, and they're being reserved quickly over the summer period.  the new rule will benefit fully vaccinated, covid-negative travellers coming from ""low-risk"" countries like australia and new zealand. in hong kong, fully vaccinated people are also required to serve quarantine in government facilities if they come into close contact with infected people, even if they've tested negative for the virus.  with vaccine uptake slow amid widespread distrust of the beijing-backed government, calls have grown for the strict rules to be relaxed for inoculated people in order to boost rates. according to bloomberg's vaccine tracker, 24. 2% of people in hong kong have received a first dose, compared to 47. 3% in singapore and 53. 8% in london -- despite an consistent supply of vaccine in the former british colony. last month, the government said that senior executives of listed companies and major financial industry companies could apply to travel into hong kong without serving quarantine, a policy that incited backlash for being elitist.  that plan has been postponed and no applications have yet been approved, bloomberg reported this week. chief executive carrie lam said on tuesday when asked about the panel's recommendation to shorten quarantine for vaccinated travellers that ""we have no objection in principle, but there is still a lot of work to follow up -- how to meet the public health requirements without causing great inconvenience to visitors or colleagues in charge for taking blood samples for antibody tests.

2021-06-17,"Far-flung Taiwan island Pratas risks triggering a US-China clash, East Asia News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. taipei (bloomberg) when 28 chinese warplanes streaked through the skies around taiwan on tuesday (june 15) the largest such incursion this year they followed a pattern that has generated alarm among us and taiwanese military planners. some of the people's liberation army planes, including bombers, fighter jets and surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft, flew east from the chinese coast around the southern tip of taiwan.  the rest broke off and briefly darted further south toward tiny pratas island in the south china sea before turning back. the pla has flown close to the atoll uninhabited except for a garrison of taiwanese marines and coast guard officers once a week on average since sept 16, when the taiwanese defense ministry began releasing detailed data. if all incursions into taiwan's air-defense-identification zone between pratas and the chinese mainland are included, the patrols have become an almost daily occurrence. the exercises signal beijing's displeasure with the democratically elected government in taipei and its successful effort to court greater us support, as seen by a mention in the group of seven communique this week. in response to china's moves, president joe biden's administration has stepped up surveillance flights near pratas, raising the risk of a confrontation or clash between two of the world's most powerful militaries. the chinese focus on pratas serves several aims of president xi jinping, highlighting taiwan's vulnerability to attack while probing its defenses. the strategy also tests the limits of washington's security commitment, and whether it's willing to go to war to defend largely vacant reefs hundreds of miles from the nearest american base. the aerial campaign demonstrates that beijing has options for striking a blow against taipei that fall well short of a dangerous invasion across the 130km taiwan strait, which is becoming a more urgent concern for american military planners. taking pratas island located closer to hong kong than taiwan could give china a new launching ground for future military operations without provoking a full-scale conflict with the us. ""there is now a serious possibility that china seeks to occupy one of the outer islands,"" prof ben schreer, who studies taiwan's defense policy and heads macquarie university's department of security studies and criminology in sydney. ""if that happens, what is the international community going to do? what is the us going to do?""even if mr xi has no immediate plans to seize any land, regular incursions help establish china's long-term presence in territory it claims as its own. meanwhile, the drumbeat of exercises adds to the domestic political concerns for taiwanese president tsai ing-wen, who rejects beijing's claims to sovereignty. the campaign has put new strain on taiwan's aging air force, which has seen three fatal crashes in the past nine months.  the service announced in march that it expected to spend nt$2. 1 billion (s$101. 5 million) more this year countering pla operations. china's warplanes made more incursions into the southern part of taiwan's air defense identification zone last year than in the previous five years combined.  while beijing has blamed the exercises on tsai's refusal to accept that both sides belong to ""one china,"" the increase has tracked with u. s.  efforts to step up arm sales and diplomatic exchanges with taiwan. tuesday's operation came after the g-7 called for a ""peaceful resolution"" of the dispute in a statement more critical of china than past communiques. ""we urge the relevant countries to observe their promise to china and handle the taiwan question properly and stop sending wrongful signals to taiwan separatist forces,"" taiwan affairs office spokesman ma xiaoguang told reporters on wednesday in beijing. such exercises help ""carry out military simulations according to an actual combat plan and rehearse in the real environment"", mr song zhongping, a former pla instructor on missile technology, told a social media account run by the beijing youth daily newspaper. while taiwan's military has expressed confidence in its ability to defend pratas, it would be operating more than 400 kilometers from its coast and facing the world's largest navy.  taiwan has scrambled to upgrade its defenses around the atoll, reinforcing the garrison with 200 marines, sending in anti-armor rockets and restarting a stalled project to upgrade the local airstrip. another concern for taiwan is a permanent loss of control over the skies between the main island and its territories in the south china sea, as taipei seeks to avoid close confrontations with china that could escalate into a clash. chinese state media have hinted at an expansion of the strategy amid domestic calls for a tougher response to us moves. the global times newspaper, which last year said beijing was considering military flights directly over taiwan, reported that china may retaliate over a visit by an american c-17 cargo plane earlier this month by sending patrols closer to taipei. enodo economics, an independent macroeconomic and political forecasting company focused on china, raised the chances of a military conflict between the us and china to 65 per cent in march, compared with 10 per cent in january 2019. ""while a surprise attack on taiwan is possible, a more characteristic chinese approach would be to ratchet up threats with a view to both eroding taiwan's will to resist and providing a retrospective justification for its actions,"" said ms diana choyleva, enodo's chief economist. ""china is currently attempting to bring about reunification through a 'gray zone' campaign of mounting pressure, confident that time is on its side and that within the next few years the pla will be able to overmatch the u. s.  in the taiwan strait. ""the flights show china demonstrating its ability to project force far from its coast, potentially encircling taiwan and denying the us access to possible battlefields.  with no troops on taiwan, the bulk of american forces during any conflict would be deployed from their main bases in japan, south korea and guam, hundreds of miles away. us warships in the western pacific seeking to intervene near pratas would need to pass through the bashi channel, which separates southern taiwan from the northern philippines. correspondingly, the pla has made nine flights into the channel since september, giving its long-range h-6 bombers a route to the open sea while picking up data on rival defense systems and allowing its pilots to become more comfortable. china also test-fired anti-ship missiles into the south china sea last year, in what us indo-pacific command admiral phil davidson called an ""unmistakable message"" of the country's focus on ""countering any potential third-party intervention during a regional crisis"". the pla air force separately released a video in september showing h-6 bombers making a simulated strike on a runway that looked similar to one at anderson air force base on guam. the us has sought to prove its commitment to ensuring the security of key shipping routes inside the so-called first-island chain, which includes the philippines, japan and taiwan. the pentagon has roughly doubled reconnaissance flights over the south china sea this year, according to peking university's south china sea strategic situation probing initiative, with 72 such patrols last month. much of those flights passed over the bashi channel, according to sites that monitor military air traffic.  in a written response to questions from bloomberg news last month, lieutenant mark langford, a spokesman for the us' seventh fleet, declined last to provide specifics on such flights, citing a need to maintain ""operational security"". mr ely ratner, biden's nominee to be assistant secretary of defence for the indo-pacific, told the senate armed services committee on wednesday that the us needs a ""combat-credible"" posture in the region to counter china. he added that he would ""carefully review the current military balance across the taiwan strait to ensure that our defense cooperation with taiwan is commensurate with the threat posed"" by china. all that military activity increases the risk of a confrontation, such as the crisis that erupted in april 2001 when a us navy ep-3 reconnaissance plane collided with a chinese f-8 fighter jet. two dozen american crew members were held for 11 days after making an emergency landing on hainan island. the biden administration has renewed calls for china to open a hotline to help keep a misunderstandings between the two sides from escalating into a conflict, so far with little success. ""i worry about accidental collisions with tragic results given the pla's aggressive actions close to taiwan and other countries,"" said ms shirley kan, an independent specialist in asian security who previously worked for the us congressional research service.

streaked through the skies around taiwan on tuesday (june 15) the largest such incursion this year they followed a pattern that has generated alarm among us and taiwanese military planners.', ""some of the people's liberation army planes, including bombers, fighter jets and surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft, flew east from the chinese coast around the southern tip of taiwan."", 'the rest broke off and briefly darted further south toward tiny pratas island in the south china sea before turning back.', 'the pla has flown close to the atoll uninhabited except for a garrison of taiwanese marines and coast guard officers once a week on average since sept 16, when the taiwanese defense ministry began releasing detailed data.', ""if all incursions into taiwan's air-defense-identification zone between pratas and the chinese mainland are included, the patrols have become an almost daily occurrence."", ""the exercises signal beijing's displeasure with the democratically elected government in taipei and its successful effort to court greater us support, as seen by a mention in the group of seven communique this week."", ""in response to china's moves, president joe biden's administration has stepped up surveillance flights near pratas, raising the risk of a confrontation or clash between two of the world's most powerful militaries."", ""the chinese focus on pratas serves several aims of president xi jinping, highlighting taiwan's vulnerability to attack while probing its defenses."", ""the strategy also tests the limits of washington's security commitment, and whether it's willing to go to war to defend largely vacant reefs hundreds of miles from the nearest american base."", 'the aerial campaign demonstrates that beijing has options for striking a blow against taipei that fall well short of a dangerous invasion across the 130km taiwan strait, which is becoming a more urgent concern for american military planners.', 'taking pratas island located closer to hong kong than taiwan could give china a new launching ground for future military operations without provoking a full-scale conflict with the us.', '""there is now a serious possibility that china seeks to occupy one of the outer islands,"" prof ben schreer, who studies taiwan\'s defense policy and heads macquarie university\'s department of security studies and criminology in sydney.', '""if that happens, what is the international community going to do?', 'what is the us going to do?', '""even if mr xi has no immediate plans to seize any land, regular incursions help establish china\'s long-term presence in territory it claims as its own.', ""meanwhile, the drumbeat of exercises adds to the domestic political concerns for taiwanese president tsai ing-wen, who rejects beijing's claims to sovereignty."", ""the campaign has put new strain on taiwan's aging air force, which has seen three fatal crashes in the past nine months."", 'the service announced in march that it expected to spend nt$2.', '1 billion (s$101.', '5 million) more this year countering pla operations.', ""china's warplanes made more incursions into the southern part of taiwan's air defense identification zone last year than in the previous five years combined."", 'while beijing has blamed the exercises on tsai\'s refusal to accept that both sides belong to ""one china,"" the increase has tracked with u. s.  efforts to step up arm sales and diplomatic exchanges with taiwan.', 'tuesday\'s operation came after the g-7 called for a ""peaceful resolution"" of the dispute in a statement more critical of china than past communiques.', '""we urge the relevant countries to observe their promise to china and handle the taiwan question properly and stop sending wrongful signals to taiwan separatist forces,"" taiwan affairs office spokesman ma xiaoguang told reporters on wednesday in beijing.', 'such exercises help ""carry out military simulations according to an actual combat plan and rehearse in the real environment"", mr song zhongping, a former pla instructor on missile technology, told a social media account run by the beijing youth daily newspaper.', ""while taiwan's military has expressed confidence in its ability to defend pratas, it would be operating more than 400 kilometers from its coast and facing the world's largest navy."", 'taiwan has scrambled to upgrade its defenses around the atoll, reinforcing the garrison with 200 marines, sending in anti-armor rockets and restarting a stalled project to upgrade the local airstrip.', 'another concern for taiwan is a permanent loss of control over the skies between the main island and its territories in the south china sea, as taipei seeks to avoid close confrontations with china that could escalate into a clash.', 'chinese state media have hinted at an expansion of the strategy amid domestic calls for a tougher response to us moves.', 'the global times newspaper, which last year said beijing was considering military flights directly over taiwan, reported that china may retaliate over a visit by an american c-17 cargo plane earlier this month by sending patrols closer to taipei.', 'enodo economics, an independent macroeconomic and political forecasting company focused on china, raised the chances of a military conflict between the us and china to 65 per cent in march, compared with 10 per cent in january 2019.', '""while a surprise attack on taiwan is possible, a more characteristic chinese approach would be to ratchet up threats with a view to both eroding taiwan\'s will to resist and providing a retrospective justification for its actions,"" said ms diana choyleva, enodo\'s chief economist.', '""china is currently attempting to bring about reunification through a \'gray zone\' campaign of mounting pressure, confident that time is on its side and that within the next few years the pla will be able to overmatch the u. s.  in the taiwan strait.', '""the flights show china demonstrating its ability to project force far from its coast, potentially encircling taiwan and denying the us access to possible battlefields.', 'with no troops on taiwan, the bulk of american forces during any conflict would be deployed from their main bases in japan, south korea and guam, hundreds of miles away.', 'us warships in the western pacific seeking to intervene near pratas would need to pass through the bashi channel, which separates southern taiwan from the northern philippines.', 'correspondingly, the pla has made nine flights into the channel since september, giving its long-range h-6 bombers a route to the open sea while picking up data on rival defense systems and allowing its pilots to become more comfortable.', 'china also test-fired anti-ship missiles into the south china sea last year, in what us indo-pacific command admiral phil davidson called an ""unmistakable message"" of the country\'s focus on ""countering any potential third-party intervention during a regional crisis"".', 'the pla air force separately released a video in september showing h-6 bombers making a simulated strike on a runway that looked similar to one at anderson air force base on guam.', 'the us has sought to prove its commitment to ensuring the security of key shipping routes inside the so-called first-island chain, which includes the philippines, japan and taiwan.', ""the pentagon has roughly doubled reconnaissance flights over the south china sea this year, according to peking university's south china sea strategic situation probing initiative, with 72 such patrols last month."", 'much of those flights passed over the bashi channel, according to sites that monitor military air traffic.', 'in a written response to questions from bloomberg news last month, lieutenant mark langford, a spokesman for the us\' seventh fleet, declined last to provide specifics on such flights, citing a need to maintain ""operational security"".', 'mr ely ratner, biden\'s nominee to be assistant secretary of defence for the indo-pacific, told the senate armed services committee on wednesday that the us needs a ""combat-credible"" posture in the region to counter china.', 'he added that he would ""carefully review the current military balance across the taiwan strait to ensure that our defense cooperation with taiwan is commensurate with the threat posed"" by china.', 'all that military activity increases the risk of a confrontation, such as the crisis that erupted in april 2001 when a us navy ep-3 reconnaissance plane collided with a chinese f-8 fighter jet.', 'two dozen american crew members were held for 11 days after making an emergency landing on hainan island.', 'the biden administration has renewed calls for china to open a hotline to help keep a misunderstandings between the two sides from escalating into a conflict, so far with little success.', '""i worry about accidental collisions with tragic results given the pla\'s aggressive actions

2021-06-17,Loki Just Introduced a Major New Comic Book Character to the MCU.,"southeast asiathis story contains spoilers for marvel's loki, season 1, episode 2.  the second episode of marvel's loki has concluded with quite the major reveal, introducing a significant character from the thor comics to the mcu.  in the closing scenes of the second episode, it is revealed that the cloak and hooded variant that loki and agent mobius have been hunting is not, in fact, simply just an identical variant of the god of mischief.  instead, it is lady loki, a female variant of our protagonist, played by sophia di martino. lady loki is a fairly major part of the recent-ish asgardian mythology of marvel comics.  she was introduced in 2008 as part of j.  michael straczynski's famed run on thor, in which loki was reborn as a woman following the apocalyptic events of ragnarok.  born into a body originally intended for lady sif, loki lived as a woman for a lengthy period, extending through to the dark reign storyline in which she teamed up with norman osborn.  in the comics, loki is both gender fluid and also able to take the form of a number of loki variations, kid loki being a particularly popular form.  it's part of the character's trickster personality; regardless of if they are a man, woman, or child, they are always loki.  the mcu may well be taking a slightly different approach to this, in that these gender/form variations of loki are present in different timelines, rather than the choice of the prime ""sacred"" timeline loki.  this second episode has already confirmed variants that include a frost giant and a hulk loki, but further episodes and more time spent with lady loki may reveal more about the mcu's loki lore.  this all links back to the recent confirmation that loki is gender fluid, as seen in his time variance authority file.  for more from loki, be sure to check out our episode 2 review, as well as our deep-dive on loki's evolution from villain to an agent of chaos.  matt purslow is ign's uk news and entertainment writer.

2021-06-17,Ngee Ann Polytechnic to fire lecturer following internal investigations into racist and Islamophobic incidents.,"following the completion of its internal investigations into the racist and islamophobic conduct of lecturer tan boon lee, ngee ann polytechnic (np) on thursday (17 june) said that it is in the process of terminating his employment. in a statement today, the polytechnic said that it has ""officially charged the staff in question for serious breach of our staff code of conduct"". ""our staff members are expected to respect cultural, ethnic and religious differences in our society.  they must uphold secularity and impartiality at all times,"" np said. mr tan came under the public spotlight after he was identified as the man making racist remarks to an interracial couple in a video uploaded by dave parkash, the indian-filipino man who was accused by mr tan of ""preying"" on chinese girls while on a night out with his girlfriend. after it was reported that mr tan was suspended from his teaching duties following the case, a former student of his took to social media to share her own experience of being subjected to islamophobic remarks from him in front of a class. ms nurul fatimah binti iskandar, who was a student of mr tan for an object-oriented programming module in 2017, said in an instagram post on 9 june that the lecturer had ""used our class period to have a full-on discourse about islam"". ""i was the only muslim in class.  he opened websites on the projector, pointing out things he didn't agree with about the quran and prophet muhammad s. a. w to the class,"" she said. based on ms nurul's record of an instagram story posted on 28 july 2017, the date of the incident, among the comments mr tan had reportedly made were ""only animals will treat their children like how allah does to his people"" and ""what type of father tells you to worship him five times a day and threatens to send you to hell if you don't?"". such remarks, she said, were merely ""the tip of the iceberg"". to worsen matters, mr tan had singled out ms nurul â who was sitting in the front of the class â and asked her if she agreed with him. ""i could barely open my mouth amidst his continuous sweeping statements.  i was barely 17, fresh out of 10 years of madrasah trying to assimilate into the new secular environment,"" she lamented. the situation had ""escalated so badly"" that ms nurul ended up sitting outside on the floor of the corridor with her classmate, merick while waiting for his ""unsettling speech"" to end.  merick had initiated the walk-out, according to ms nurul. np said in its statement on thursday that it has ""reached out to our alumna immediately to express our regret for her experience in 2017"". ""we immediately offered counselling support to her.  we have since met her to get more details of her experience and would like to apologise for the distress that she suffered, and thank her for her assistance in our internal investigations,"" it added. np noted that the police is currently investigating the matter and that it will fully cooperate with the authorities in the process. ms nurul noted in her post on 9 june that she made a complaint regarding the incident with mr tan, but no action was taken. addressing the matter, np stated today that it sought to ""understand why our alumna's feedback had not been acted upon, to tighten our feedback processes and ensure that gaps and areas of improvement are duly addressed"". ""in our conversation with her, she indicated that she could not recall whether she had emailed her feedback on the incident or raised it during a post-course focus group discussion (fgd) in 2017.  fgds are typically held at the end of every semester to seek students' feedback on courses and lecturers,"" it said. np claimed that it was not able to ""locate any records of the feedback"" from its search through its ""various feedback channels"" and her np mailbox archives. ""nonetheless, we are committed to preventing a similar incident from occurring again, and will ensure that students are made aware of the appropriate channels for them to provide feedback in a safe manner.  we will also advise our staff on how to manage and report feedback that they may receive outside of these channels, as appropriate,"" it said. np went on to say that on top of its existing course feedback channels which are anonymous, various channels are available for students to provide anonymous feedback, the most recent being a whistleblowing email channel for students at [email protected]. ""other channels for student feedback include a general enquiry asknp email, course experience dialogues as well as various student surveys conducted periodically.  in addition, students can share their feedback with their staff advisors at any time,"" said the polytechnic, adding that it will make all feedback channels more accessible and visible on its website and publicise them on its campus digital screens. np also said that it will review its internal feedback monitoring processes ""to identify and resolve any gaps in teaching and learning practices and to ensure that matters of concern can be flagged in a timely manner"". ""we also remind all staff to strictly adhere to the staff code of conduct and create a safe learning environment for all in np,"" said the polytechnic.

2021-06-17,"There's still no evidence of a Chinese lab leak. But hereâs what's changed, scientists say.","alina chan isn't saying the coronavirus definitely leaked from a lab in china.  what she is saying is what more scientists have grown comfortable discussing publicly: there's no clear evidence either way. ""i know a lot of people want to have a smoking gun,"" said chan, a postdoctoral associate at the broad institute of mit and harvard university who specializes in genetic engineering and has been vocal about the need to investigate the possibility of a lab leak.  ""it's more like breadcrumbs everywhere, and they're not always leading in one direction.  it's like the whole floor is covered in breadcrumbs. ""chan was one of 18 scientists who published a letter in the journal science last month calling for a more in-depth investigation into the virus's origin that takes into account theories about both natural occurrence and laboratory spillovers.  the letter helped kick-start a new round of calls to investigate the ""lab leak hypothesis,"" including demands from president joe biden and several leading scientists. and while public discussion of a potential lab leak has shifted significantly in recent months, as more people pay attention to a theory that was originally promulgated by former president donald trump and his followers, the scientific evidence has remained unchanged, according to interviews with five virologists who have experience in microbiology, infectious disease ecology and viral evolution. the researchers offered near-uniform summations that few conclusions can be drawn based on the available scientific evidence, but they noted that the context and circumstances of the origin debate have changed, particularly as critics point out that china hasn't been fully transparent about the earliest days of the pandemic. the shift reflects how some scientists who previously avoided the topic or were quick to dismiss it are grappling with enduring uncertainties about the virus's origin, free from the politicization that clouded such discussions during the trump administration. chan said there had been trepidation among some scientists about publicly discussing the lab leak hypothesis for fear that their words could be misconstrued or used to support racist rhetoric about how the coronavirus emerged.  trump fueled accusations that the wuhan institute of virology, a research lab in the city where the first covid-19 cases were reported, was connected to the outbreak, and on numerous occasions he called the pathogen the ""wuhan virus"" or ""kung flu. """"at the time, it was scarier to be associated with trump and to become a tool for racists, so people didn't want to publicly call for an investigation into lab origins,"" she said. now, more scientists are comfortable confronting the gamut of plausible theories â particularly given china's opacity about the topic â although many still caution that entertaining the idea of a lab leak requires clear scientific proof, which hasn't materialized. ""there has been no new evidence over the past 16 months that the virus had a lab origin,"" said maciej boni, an associate professor of biology at penn state university, who specializes in tropical disease epidemiology and viral evolution. a number of theories about how the virus may have emerged have been thrown out.  most that remain fall under three possible scenarios:the virus evolved naturally before spilling over into humans from an infected animal. the virus evolved naturally, but an employee at the lab became infected from a sample and accidentally ""leaked"" it into the community. scientists at the lab were manipulating virus samples and accidentally or intentionally released the pathogen. what makes the virus's origin a complicated matter is that the various threads can be difficult to reconcile.  while most of the virologists who spoke to nbc news said the coronavirus probably evolved in nature, they agreed that it's reasonable to look into the possibility that it came from a lab. at the heart of those suspicions is the wuhan institute of virology, a research facility founded in the 1950s that was the first in china to receive the highest level of biosafety clearance.  the institute's lab has a biosafety level of 4 (known as bsl-4, the highest level), meaning it is equipped to study the world's highest-risk infectious agents and toxins, those that require the strictest biocontainment measures.  it's that designation, and the lab's location in the city where the outbreak was first reported, that made the institute an early suspect. ""if we had a pandemic that was sourced near to a bsl-4 lab in the u. s. , the first thing you would be asking is if they were working with that pathogen in that lab,"" said an expert on evolutionary genetics of infectious diseases, andrew read, a professor of biology at penn state. still, he cautioned that while a lab leak is plausible, that doesn't necessarily mean it's the most probable explanation. boni said it's still more likely that the virus passed from an animal, such as a bat, into humans.  he said his experiences conducting field epidemiology work on avian influenza in vietnam from 2008 to 2016 showed how close contact with wildlife, such as in ""wet markets"" around the world where outdoor stalls sell meat, seafood and live animals for consumption, can create easy opportunities for pathogens to spill into human populations. ""going back over the past 25 years of emerging viruses that have crossed species boundaries from animals to humans, the most common route is something like a wet market or farm or some other form of human and animal contact,"" he said.  ""these are far more common than lab accidents. ""the first cluster of covid-19 infections was traced to the huanan seafood market in wuhan, leading to early speculation that it may have been where the virus jumped from animals into humans.  but chinese researchers have since found that several of the earliest known cases of covid-19 in the city were unrelated to the market, meaning the virus may already have been spreading in the community. a joint investigation this year by the world health organization and china focused on the possibility of a zoonotic, or animal, origin.  the team's report, released in march, found that the virus probably emerged in bats and jumped to an intermediary animal before it spread to humans. the team also downplayed the theory that the virus leaked from the wuhan institute, describing the scenario as ""extremely unlikely. "" but the who-led investigation was heavily criticized for not doing enough to review all plausible hypotheses.  and the validity of the findings was questioned because the investigation hinged on china's cooperation, and the chinese government didn't give researchers access to full records and raw data. chan and 17 other scientists, including ralph baric, a virologist at the university of north carolina, chapel hill; david relman, a microbiologist at stanford university; and akiko iwasaki, an immunologist at yale university, signed the letter in science in response to the shortcomings of the who report. within the scientific community, the letter was seen as something of a turning point, lending credibility to the hypothesis that the virus may have escaped from the lab. ""i think it had a big effect,"" chan said.  ""i think it literally helped all the people who wanted to investigate this by saying: this is not bogus.  top scientists think this is plausible. ""calls for a more in-depth investigation into both the natural origin theory and the lab leak hypothesis have been fueled, at least in part, by growing circumstantial evidence uncovered over the last year by a band of anonymous internet sleuths. last year, a member of the amateur investigative team, which calls itself drastic (short for decentralized radical autonomous search team investigating covid-19), combed through online records and found a 2013 thesis by a postgraduate student at kunming medical university in china that described six workers at a mine in yunnan province who fell ill with severe pneumonia caused by a ""sars-like"" coronavirus. three of the mine workers eventually died, but not much else is known about the situation.  in research published in november by scientists at the wuhan institute, serum samples from four of the mine workers were tested and showed no trace of sars-cov-2, the virus that causes covid-19. separately, a u. s.  intelligence report disclosed that three researchers at the wuhan institute sought treatment at a hospital after they fell ill in november 2019, as the wall street journal first reported in may. during the who-led investigation this year, officials at the wuhan institute said all staff members had tested negative for covid-19 antibodies.  its leaders have been adamant that the virus didn't escape from the facility, but the chinese government's reluctance to share records and test results has cast suspicion over what the lab's scientists knew â and when. although they are far from conclusive, the intelligence report and the mine workers' mysterious illnesses have been presented as circumstantial evidence that scientists at the wuhan institute were studying risky coronaviruses similar to sars-cov-2 and that the virus may have escaped from the lab, perhaps after an employee became infected. the mine incident also drew attention to a separate sars-like virus that chinese researchers collected from a bat in yunnan province in 2013.  shi zhengli, a prominent bat researcher who directs the center for emerging infectious diseases at the wuhan institute of virology, co-wrote a paper published in february 2020 detailing the virus, known as ratg13. the genomes of ratg13 and sars-cov-2 were found to be 96. 2 percent alike, prompting some to wonder whether the pandemic had been caused by lab experiments on ratg13 that had gone awry.  the similarities between the two viruses also raised questions about the possibility that chinese researchers were conducting ""gain of function"" experiments, which involve manipulating viruses in a lab to make them more dangerous or more transmissible to understand their inner workings. gain-of-function research isn't altogether uncommon in virology, but such experiments are controversial because of the risks.  a scientist could, for example, unwittingly or by design create a pathogen that is better adapted to invade human cells or cause more severe infections.  but there are real benefits to gain-of-function research, said robert garry, a virologist at tulane university in new orleans.  for one, understanding the characteristics of a virus and its transmissibility is critical to developing vaccines and lifesaving drugs, he said. he said most virologists take the responsibility of such experiments seriously. ""it's not the wild west,"" he said.  ""it's very highly regulated. ""in 2014, the u. s.  national institutes of health imposed a moratorium on gain-of-function research after two lab accidents involving anthrax and a strain of h5n1 bird flu occurred at the centers for disease control and prevention.  funding for gain-of-function experiments was paused for three years while the government conducted safety assessments.  the ban was reversed in january 2017, during the trump administration, after an independent science advisory panel found that the overall risk to public safety was low. while it's possible that scientists at the wuhan institute were making genetic tweaks to samples, a coronavirus like ratg13 that is 96. 2 percent similar still can't easily be altered to create sars-cov-2, garry said. ""taking a virus that is 96 percent similar and sequencing and converting it to sars-cov-2 is impossible,"" he said.  ""that kind of evolution takes maybe three to five decades in nature.  you just can't force that in a lab. ""dr.  charles chiu, a virologist at the university of california, san francisco, added that the differences between ratg13 and sars-cov-2 exceed the capabilities of genetic engineering. ""the differences are scattered throughout the genome,"" he said.  ""there's a big difference between 96 percent similar and 100 percent identical.  we just don't have the ability to make those kinds of changes. ""in other words, the experts say, it's unlikely that scientists could snip and splice bits of a virus or tweak a pathogen's genome in such a way that would create sars-cov-2, even if researchers were using closely related coronaviruses. ""we're very good at imitating nature â we have, for instance, been able to synthesize polio virus â but our ability to manipulate or change the sequence of viruses is still limited,"" chiu said. chan, of the broad institute, wasn't ready to rule out the possibility of genetic engineering, saying that if minor tweaks were being made to virus samples, it could be difficult to detect the fingerprints of such work. ""you can do recombination without leaving a trace,"" she said.  ""basically, it's like you can 3d-print clothing with no seams, so it's difficult to tell if anything has been manipulated or stitched together in a lab. ""chan acknowledged that it's ""definitely possible"" that the virus evolved in nature but added that all options should be kept on the table because neither the natural origins theory nor the lab leak hypothesis can be ruled out. ""all the evidence right now is circumstantial, and it's consistent with both lab and natural origins,"" she said.  ""there's precedents for lab leaks, the genetic data could swing either way, and the epidemiological data, which is how it unfolded in wuhan, can also swing either way.  none of this is pointing in any one direction. ""and it may be years, or even decades, before scientists have any clarity on the topic.  the ebola virus, which was discovered in 1976, is thought to have spread to humans from bats or nonhuman primates, but scientists still haven't identified the origin from a specific animal host. ""the key issue here is that we simply don't have the information to make really firm conclusions,"" said chiu, of the university of california, san francisco, referring to covid-19.  ""unless we know exactly what happened, we're simply making guesses.

want to have a smoking gun,"" said chan, a postdoctoral associate at the broad institute of mit and harvard university who specializes in genetic engineering and has been vocal about the need to investigate the possibility of a lab leak.', '""it\'s more like breadcrumbs everywhere, and they\'re not always leading in one direction.', ""it's like the whole floor is covered in breadcrumbs."", '""chan was one of 18 scientists who published a letter in the journal science last month calling for a more in-depth investigation into the virus\'s origin that takes into account theories about both natural occurrence and laboratory spillovers.', 'the letter helped kick-start a new round of calls to investigate the ""lab leak hypothesis,"" including demands from president joe biden and several leading scientists.', 'and while public discussion of a potential lab leak has shifted significantly in recent months, as more people pay attention to a theory that was originally promulgated by former president donald trump and his followers, the scientific evidence has remained unchanged, according to interviews with five virologists who have experience in microbiology, infectious disease ecology and viral evolution.', ""the researchers offered near-uniform summations that few conclusions can be drawn based on the available scientific evidence, but they noted that the context and circumstances of the origin debate have changed, particularly as critics point out that china hasn't been fully transparent about the earliest days of the pandemic."", ""the shift reflects how some scientists who previously avoided the topic or were quick to dismiss it are grappling with enduring uncertainties about the virus's origin, free from the politicization that clouded such discussions during the trump administration."", 'chan said there had been trepidation among some scientists about publicly discussing the lab leak hypothesis for fear that their words could be misconstrued or used to support racist rhetoric about how the coronavirus emerged.', 'trump fueled accusations that the wuhan institute of virology, a research lab in the city where the first covid-19 cases were reported, was connected to the outbreak, and on numerous occasions he called the pathogen the ""wuhan virus"" or ""kung flu.', '""""at the time, it was scarier to be associated with trump and to become a tool for racists, so people didn\'t want to publicly call for an investigation into lab origins,"" she said.', ""now, more scientists are comfortable confronting the gamut of plausible theories â particularly given china's opacity about the topic â although many still caution that entertaining the idea of a lab leak requires clear scientific proof, which hasn't materialized."", '""there has been no new evidence over the past 16 months that the virus had a lab origin,"" said maciej boni, an associate professor of biology at penn state university, who specializes in tropical disease epidemiology and viral evolution.', 'a number of theories about how the virus may have emerged have been thrown out.', 'most that remain fall under three possible scenarios:the virus evolved naturally before spilling over into humans from an infected animal.', 'the virus evolved naturally, but an employee at the lab became infected from a sample and accidentally ""leaked"" it into the community.', 'scientists at the lab were manipulating virus samples and accidentally or intentionally released the pathogen.', ""what makes the virus's origin a complicated matter is that the various threads can be difficult to reconcile."", ""while most of the virologists who spoke to nbc news said the coronavirus probably evolved in nature, they agreed that it's reasonable to look into the possibility that it came from a lab."", 'at the heart of those suspicions is the wuhan institute of virology, a research facility founded in the 1950s that was the first in china to receive the highest level of biosafety clearance.', ""the institute's lab has a biosafety level of 4 (known as bsl-4, the highest level), meaning it is equipped to study the world's highest-risk infectious agents and toxins, those that require the strictest biocontainment measures."", ""it's that designation, and the lab's location in the city where the outbreak was first reported, that made the institute an early suspect."", '""if we had a pandemic that was sourced near to a bsl-4 lab in the u. s. , the first thing you would be asking is if they were working with that pathogen in that lab,"" said an expert on evolutionary genetics of infectious diseases, andrew read, a professor of biology at penn state.', ""still, he cautioned that while a lab leak is plausible, that doesn't necessarily mean it's the most probable explanation."", ""boni said it's still more likely that the virus passed from an animal, such as a bat, into humans."", 'he said his experiences conducting field epidemiology work on avian influenza in vietnam from 2008 to 2016 showed how close contact with wildlife, such as in ""wet markets"" around the world where outdoor stalls sell meat, seafood and live animals for consumption, can create easy opportunities for pathogens to spill into human populations.', '""going back over the past 25 years of emerging viruses that have crossed species boundaries from animals to humans, the most common route is something like a wet market or farm or some other form of human and animal contact,"" he said.', '""these are far more common than lab accidents.', '""the first cluster of covid-19 infections was traced to the huanan seafood market in wuhan, leading to early speculation that it may have been where the virus jumped from animals into humans.', 'but chinese researchers have since found that several of the earliest known cases of covid-19 in the city were unrelated to the market, meaning the virus may already have been spreading in the community.', 'a joint investigation this year by the world health organization and china focused on the possibility of a zoonotic, or animal, origin.', ""the team's report, released in march, found that the virus probably emerged in bats and jumped to an intermediary animal before it spread to humans."", 'the team also downplayed the theory that the virus leaked from the wuhan institute, describing the scenario as ""extremely unlikely. ""', 'but the who-led investigation was heavily criticized for not doing enough to review all plausible hypotheses.', ""and the validity of the findings was questioned because the investigation hinged on china's cooperation, and the chinese government didn't give researchers access to full records and raw data."", 'chan and 17 other scientists, including ralph baric, a virologist at the university of north carolina, chapel hill; david relman, a microbiologist at stanford university; and akiko iwasaki, an immunologist at yale university, signed the letter in science in response to the shortcomings of the who report.', 'within the scientific community, the letter was seen as something of a turning point, lending credibility to the hypothesis that the virus may have escaped from the lab.', '""i think it had a big effect,"" chan said.', '""i think it literally helped all the people who wanted to investigate this by saying: this is not bogus.', 'top scientists think this is plausible.', '""calls for a more in-depth investigation into both the natural origin theory and the lab leak hypothesis have been fueled, at least in part, by growing circumstantial evidence uncovered over the last year by a band of anonymous internet sleuths.', 'last year, a member of the amateur investigative team, which calls itself drastic (short for decentralized radical autonomous search team investigating covid-19), combed through online records and found a 2013 thesis by a postgraduate student at kunming medical university in china that described six workers at a mine in yunnan province who fell ill with severe pneumonia caused by a ""sars-like"" coronavirus.', 'three of the mine workers eventually died, but not much else is known about the situation.', 'in research published in november by scientists at the wuhan institute, serum samples from four of the mine workers were tested and showed no trace of sars-cov-2, the virus that causes covid-19.', 'separately, a u. s.  intelligence report disclosed that three researchers at the wuhan institute sought treatment at a hospital after they fell ill in november 2019, as the wall street journal first reported in may.', 'during the who-led investigation this year, officials at the wuhan institute said all staff members had tested negative for covid-19 antibodies.', ""its leaders have been adamant that the virus didn't escape from the facility, but the chinese government's reluctance to share records and test results has cast suspicion over what the lab's scientists knew â and when."", ""although they are far from conclusive, the intelligence report and the mine workers' mysterious illnesses have been presented as circumstantial evidence that scientists at the wuhan institute were studying risky coronaviruses similar to sars-cov-2 and that the virus may have escaped from the lab, perhaps after an employee became infected."", 'the mine incident also drew attention to a separate sars-like virus that chinese researchers collected from a bat in yunnan province in 2013.  shi zhengli, a prominent bat researcher who directs the center for emerging infectious diseases at the wuhan institute of virology, co-wrote a paper published in february 2020 detailing the virus, known as ratg13.', 'the genomes of ratg13 and sars-cov-2 were found to be 96.', '2 percent alike, prompting some to wonder whether the pandemic had been caused by lab experiments on ratg13 that had gone awry.', 'the similarities between the two viruses also raised questions about the possibility that chinese researchers were conducting ""gain of function"" experiments, which involve manipulating viruses in a lab to make them more dangerous or more transmissible to understand their inner workings.', ""gain-of-function research isn't altogether uncommon in virology, but such experiments are controversial because of the risks."", 'a scientist could, for example, unwittingly or by design create a pathogen that is better adapted to invade human cells or cause more severe infections.', 'but there are real benefits to gain-of-function research, said robert garry, a virologist at tulane university in new orleans.', 'for one, understanding the characteristics of a virus and its transmissibility is critical to developing vaccines and lifesaving drugs, he said.', 'he said most virologists take the responsibility of such experiments seriously.', '""it\'s not the wild west,"" he said.', '""it\'s very highly regulated.', '""in 2014, the u. s.  national institutes of health imposed a moratorium on gain-of-function research after two lab accidents involving anthrax and a strain of h5n1 bird flu occurred at the centers for disease control and prevention.', 'funding for gain-of-function experiments was paused for three years while the government conducted safety assessments.', 'the ban was reversed in january 2017, during the trump administration, after an independent science advisory panel found that the overall risk to public safety was low.', ""while it's possible that scientists at the wuhan institute were making genetic tweaks to samples, a coronavirus like ratg13 that is 96."", ""2 percent similar still can't easily be altered to create sars-cov-2, garry said."", '""taking a virus that is 96 percent similar and sequencing and converting it to sars-cov-2 is impossible,"" he said.', '""that kind of evolution takes maybe three to five decades in nature.', ""you just can't force that in a lab."", '""dr.  charles chiu, a virologist at the university of california, san francisco, added that the differences between ratg13 and sars-cov-2 exceed the capabilities of genetic engineering.', '""the differences are scattered throughout the genome,"" he said.', '""there\'s a big difference between 96 percent similar and 100 percent identical.', ""we just don't have the ability to make those kinds of changes."", '""in other words, the experts say, it\'s unlikely that scientists could snip and splice bits of a virus or tweak a pathogen\'s genome in such a way that would create sars-cov-2, even if researchers were using closely related coronaviruses.', '""we\'re very good at imitating nature â we have, for instance, been able to synthesize polio virus â but our ability to manipulate or change the sequence of viruses is still limited,"" chiu said.', ""chan, of the broad institute, wasn't ready to rule out the possibility of genetic engineering, saying that if minor tweaks were being made to virus samples, it could be difficult to detect the fingerprints of such work."", '""you can do recombination without leaving a trace,"" she said.', '""basically, it\'s like you can 3d-print clothing with no seams, so it\'s difficult to tell if anything has been manipulated or stitched together in a lab.', '""chan acknowledged that it\'s ""definitely possible"" that the virus evolved in nature but added that all options should be kept on the table because neither the natural origins theory nor the lab leak hypothesis can be ruled out.', '""all the evidence right now is circumstantial, and it\'s consistent with both lab and natural origins,"" she said.', '""there\'s precedents for lab leaks, the genetic data could swing either way, and the epidemiological data, which is how it unfolded in wuhan, can also swing

""while there was an infringement of our privacy and intellectual property rights, our intentions have always been clear from the start to be active citizens and to positively contribute to making singapore a better, more inclusive home for our daughter,"" she said. she was referring to how her and her husband's wedding photo had been used by a vendor to create a standee alongside a decorative platform and banner depicting radin mas mp melvin yong and his hari raya aidilfitri greetings to residents at a housing board estate in radin mas constituency recently. this drew a public apology from the pa and an offer from the government agency to meet her and her husband, mr razif abdullah, to apologise in person for the distress caused by its mistakes. the pa had explained in an earlier statement that its radin mas constituency office had engaged a vendor, warabi enterprise (art studio), to design and put up hari raya aidilfitri decorations at the tiong bahru orchid estate. [[nid:530926]]after ms sarah drew attention to the matter, the pa removed the standee, and offered to meet the couple. however, the pa on monday announced that it had decided to cancel the meeting, citing disagreements with the couple over the purpose of the meeting and how they had characterised the incident. the pa noted that she had made a public call for messages and suggestions ahead of the meeting, and said it did not see why the meeting ""should be appropriated as a platform for (ms sarah) to funnel the views and comments of persons unrelated to the incident"". it had also said ms sarah had shared claims that the incident ""perpetuates the racist culture"" and was ""racist"", and rejected these claims. in her response to the pa's decision, ms sarah said that the incident did not just affect her and her husband through the ""culturally insensitive"" depiction of hari raya aidilfitri celebrations, but also the wider community that celebrates hari raya aidilfitri. ""we are all equal stakeholders in the work that the pa does.  we feel this is a missed opportunity for constructive dialogue; for thoughts and suggestions of members of the community to be relayed, and also for the people's association to listen to the people's voices.  it is unfortunate that the pa has turned this opportunity down,"" she said. ""we will continue to advocate for deeper intercultural understanding and greater social cohesion in our everyday lives as singaporeans,"" ms sarah added. on monday, the pa said it had wanted to clarify its position, elaborate on the steps it had taken to prevent such incidents from recurring, and hear her suggestions of how it might improve at the meeting. [embed]https://www. instagram. com/p/cqi44ohbnv3/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading[/embed]it also said it had, over e-mail, explained to ms sarah that it values racial and religious harmony in singapore. the pa also said that what happened in radin mas was an isolated incident, but nevertheless shows that it can fall short. ""we agree it is important for our staff and volunteers to be sensitive to and knowledgeable about the cultures of all our ethnic groups.  we are now looking at establishing a resource panel to guide and advise our staff on cultural matters,"" it said. it added that it will also step up training efforts to enhance staff and volunteers' understanding and appreciation of singapore's different cultures. this article was first published in the straits times.  permission required for reproduction.

2021-06-17,Indonesia's 'forest destroyer' on the run for 13 years caught in Singapore.,"
                    thursday, 17 jun 2021
                adelin lis was convicted of making false declarations to obtain a visit pass on multiple occasions in 2017 and 2018.  north sumatra prosecutor's officesingapore (the straits times/ann): an indonesian businessman on the run for 13 years over corruption and illegal logging in his country has been caught and dealt with by singapore authorities for immigration offences. adelin lis committed immigration offences in singapore and was convicted of making false declarations to obtain a visit pass on multiple occasions in 2017 and 2018, the immigration and checkpoints authority (ica) said on thursday (june 17) in response to queries by the straits times. on june 9 this year, he was fined $14,000 for his offences. according to charge sheets seen by the straits times, the 63-year-old had falsely declared in his disembarkation form that he had never used a passport under a different name to enter singapore. adelin pleaded guilty earlier in a singapore district court to four immigration-related charges. eleven other charges, including for using an indonesian passport with the name ""hendro leonardi"" and a different birth date to enter singapore, were taken into consideration by the court during adelin's sentencing. indonesia's attorney general's office (ago) said in a statement on wednesday that the singapore authorities had checked with the indonesian embassy in singapore if the two names which shared the same immigration data referred to the same person. ""based on the data available at the directorate general of immigration, it is confirmed that the two people are the same,"" said ago spokesman leonard eben ezer simanjuntak. in his home country of indonesia, adelin was notorious among environmentalists as the destroyer of forests in sumatra. ""he's a big fish.  his business in the downstream and upstream logging sector and his illegal logging activities, including business in oil palm plantations, have destroyed forests and caused state losses,"" arie rompas, forest campaign team leader of environmental group greenpeace indonesia, told the straits times. leonard said adelin has been a fugitive since 2008 and was listed on the interpol red notice. in august 2008, indonesia's supreme court found him guilty of corruption and illegal logging in north sumatra province, and sentenced him to 10 years in prison and a fine of 110 billion rupiah (us$7million). the verdict overturned a previous acquittal by a lower court, medan district court, in november 2007 which had sparked public outcry nationwide on concerns that witness testimonies were not properly considered by the judges and field investigation was lacking. adelin, the son of the owner of pt mujur timber, a wood processing company in sibolga, north sumatra, has been on the wanted list of the north sumatra prosecutor's office since july 2012. leonard also said adelin and his bodyguards had resisted arrest at the indonesian embassy in beijing in 2006, beating up the embassy staff before fleeing. as such, indonesia's attorney general hopes the indonesian law enforcement officers will be allowed ""a special pick-up of this high-profile fugitive"" from singapore, he added. according to the ica, the indonesian embassy had offered to repatriate adelin to indonesia via private air transportation on june 16. ""however, ica had declined this arrangement as the repatriation of all undesirable foreigners is independently conducted by singapore authorities,"" the ic spokesperson said. ""in accordance with ica's established procedure, adelin lis will be repatriated to his country of origin as soon as his commercial flight arrangement is confirmed.

2021-06-17,Football: Locatelli brace eases Italy into Euro 2020 knockouts.,"rome: manuel locatelli bagged a brace of goals for the first time in his career as imperious italy defeated switzerland 3-0 at the stadio olimpico on wednesday to become the first side into the last-16 of euro 2020. midfielder locatelli started and finished the move from which he opened the scoring, netting from close range following sassuolo team mate domenico berardi's excellent run down the right wing.  he then rifled a shot into the bottom corner of the net from the edge of the box early in the second half. ciro immobile added a late third to secure back-to-back 3-0 wins for italy in the tournament, which extends their unbeaten run to 29 games, the last 10 of which have been victories where they have scored 31 goals and conceded none. italy lead group a with six points after two rounds of matches and are ahead of wales (four), switzerland (one) and turkey (zero).  they can seal top spot with a draw in their final group game against wales on sunday when the swiss face turkey. the italians outclassed their opponents and delighted the home crowd who have now seen their side score three times in a european championship match for the second game in a row having never done so previously. italy skipper giorgio chiellini, making his 14th european championship appearance, more than any other outfield player for italy, thought he had scored when he powered past two defenders to fire in from close range only for his effort to be ruled out for handball. the italians were not to be denied, however, even after chiellini went off injured, with locatelli launching a move with a brilliant pass and then finishing it off after berardi had cut in from the right in the 26th minute. the swiss pressed high after the break in search of an equaliser but it was italy who scored again with locatelli rifling in from the edge of the box for his second goal of the evening. italy keeper gianluigi donnarumma stopped a double effort from steven zuber in the 64th minute to protect their flawless record over the last 10 games, before immobile twice fired narrowly wide. the italy striker did get onto the scoresheet in the 89th, however, thumping in his shot from 20 metres to beat keeper yann sommer. switzerland have now won none of their last nine matches against italy and last beat their neighbours 28 years ago. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

""all bioweapons-related subjects that the country has should be subject to scrutiny,"" he was quoted as saying. commenting on the study on wednesday, foreign ministry spokesman zhao lijian said it was now ""obvious"" that the covid-19 outbreak had ""multiple origins"" and that other countries should cooperate with the world health organisation (who). the origin of the pandemic has become a source of political tension between china and the united states, with much of the focus on the wuhan institute of virology, located in the city where the outbreak was first identified in late 2019. a report by a us government national laboratory concluded that it was plausible that the virus had leaked from the wuhan lab, the wall street journal reported earlier this month. a previous study has raised the possibility that sars-cov-2 could have been circulating in europe as early as september, but experts said this did not necessarily mean it did not originate in china, where many sars-like coronaviruses have been found in the wild. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright Â© 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-17,China mourns passing of acclaimed pig that survived 2008 quake.,"pig that became chinese national icon after surviving 36 days under rubble has diedfirst published on thu 17 jun 2021 03. 39 edta pig that became an unlikely national icon in china after surviving 36 days under rubble following an earthquake in 2008 has died at the age of 14. zhu jianqiang, meaning ""strong-willed pig"", shot to fame after being discovered alive after the magnitude-7. 9 earthquake in south-western sichuan province on 12 may 2008. the earthquake left nearly 90,000 people dead or missing, and the pig's miraculous story â it subsisted on a bag of charcoal and rainwater â was hailed as an inspiring symbol of the will to survive. witnesses said the young zhu jianqiang had lost so much weight by the time it was pulled from the rubble that it looked more like a goat.  a museum near the city of chengdu bought the pig for 3,008 yuan (about Â£335) and kept it as a tourist attraction while it lived out its days. it succumbed to ""old age and exhaustion"" on wednesday night, the museum said on china's weibo platform. in human terms, zhu jianqiang was 100 years old, the global times said, citing its breeder. it was named china's animal of the year in 2008 because it ""vividly illustrated the spirit of never giving up"". by midday on thursday the weibo hashtag ""strong pig died"" had drawn nearly 300m views.  weibo users hailed it as ""the most famous pig in history"".

2021-06-17,"Should dining in resume as cases spike? Experts are divided, Singapore News.","while the country cheered last week over the news that some measures in phase two (heightened alert) would be eased from june 13, the beleaguered food and beverage (f&b) industry also perked up when the ministry of health (moh) said dining in for groups of five will be allowed to resume from next monday (june 21), as long as the covid-19 situation remained under control. but with community infections spiking of late, they may now have to delay welcoming back dine-in customers. in a video on facebook yesterday, finance minister lawrence wong, co-chair of the multi-ministry task force tackling the pandemic, said the government is ""evaluating the timing and scope of the next stage of reopening"" because of the ""latest outbreak of cases"". dr paul tambyah, president of the asia-pacific society of clinical microbiology and infection, does not believe the current situation is dire enough to postpone lifting the restriction on dining in, especially with the country's vaccination numbers ticking up. he said: ""all these public health interventions are risk versus benefit calculations.  the economic and social impact of further restricting dining in is most likely going to far outweigh any possible benefit in reducing infections in a highly vaccinated society like ours. ""associate professor hsu li yang, vice-dean of global health at the saw swee hock school of public health at the national university of singapore (nus), said: ""we will have to ease measures sooner or later. [[nid:529981]]""the food and beverage industry has been severely affected over the past year, and the impact is disproportionately higher on the smaller establishments and elderly hawkers that are less tech-savvy and who are less able to transit to online deliveries. ""a delay in reopening would be tough on restaurants, hawkers and other f&b outlets, and will also be a blow to members of the public who have been looking forward to eating out. for dr hannah clapham, assistant professor at the saw swee hock school of public health at nus, vaccinations, transmissibility and timing are the keys to deciding whether to continue to ease measures. ""vaccination rates are rapidly increasing in the population, but we still have some way to go.  with the current delta variant being more transmissible, it is important to continue to keep a handle on the transmission until more people in the population are protected,"" she told the new paper yesterday. from june 6 to 12, the number of community infections here averaged 4. 6 cases.  the average for linked and unlinked cases was 2. 6 and 2, respectively. [[nid:531770]]over the next four days, the average number of community infections grew to 15. 25, with an average of 12. 75 linked cases and 2. 5 unlinked cases. and as of yesterday, there were 39 cases linked to the cluster at bukit merah view market and food centre. referring to the spike in cases, dr leong hoe nam, an infectious diseases specialist at mount elizabeth novena hospital, said: ""the number of unlinked cases is important.  in fact, it is the more important of the two (linked and unlinked cases).  it tells us when cases were not anticipated and where contact tracing failed. ""with unlinked cases, we risk the virus spreading uncontrollably. ""while it is ""expected"" and ""normal"" for covid-19 community cases to hit double digits, he added: ""the number of unlinked cases should be below two and ideally none at all.  anything between three and five is worrying.  the virus spreads very fast. ""singapore moved to phase two (heightened alert) on may 16 after a spike in community cases, and it was slated to end on june 13 if the measures worked. [[nid:524350]]with the number of cases falling, the moh announced that the country would move to phase three (heightened alert) starting from june 14, with people allowed to gather in groups of five, up from two, and operating capacity limits for attractions, cruises, museums and public libraries going up from 25 per cent to 50 per cent, among other moves. a further relaxation of measures, including dining in, was set to follow a week later. professor dale fisher, an infectious diseases expert from the nus yong loo lin school of medicine, has consistently emphasised the importance of the rate of vaccination. ""economically, many hawkers, restaurant owners and workers have been suffering.  on the other hand, there is a high risk of covid-19 spreading as people mingle with masks off.  this is the argument to balance,"" prof fisher said. ""of course, if everyone in the country were to be vaccinated, we would be comfortable that anyone infected would usually have only a mild illness, if anything.

""it also noted that she had made a public call for messages and suggestions ahead of the meeting.  ""we find this odd.  we do not see why our meeting should be appropriated as a platform for her to funnel the views and comments of persons unrelated to the incident,"" the pa added.  ""all these lead us to believe her purpose in agreeing to meet with us has gone far beyond the radin mas incident.  we therefore see no point in proceeding with the meeting. ""the couple's wedding photo had been downloaded online and used by vendor warabi enterprise (art studio) for a standee alongside a decorative platform and banner of radin mas mp melvin yong and his hari raya greetings to residents.  after ms sarah drew attention to the matter, the pa removed the standee, and offered to meet the couple. yesterday, the pa said it had wanted to clarify its position, elaborate on the steps it had taken to prevent such incidents recurring, and hear her suggestions of how it might improve, at the meeting.  it had, over e-mail, explained to ms sarah that it values racial and religious harmony in singapore. ms sarah's claims that the pa referred to were in two instagram stories she posted recently.  in the first, she reshared an instagram story by @jeanpsychologist who thanked ms sarah for posting about the incident and called for chinese singaporeans to ""educate ourselves on our conditioned racism"", saying this is ""long overdue towards our friends in minority communities who have to put up with our ignorance which continues to perpetuate the racist culture that hurts them"". in the second, she said she was thankful to those who stood in solidarity with her and her husband as well as other ethnic minorities after ""this incident (and other racist attacks and incidents)"". the pa also claimed ms sarah had insinuated in an online talk show hosted by nanyang technological university academic walid jumblatt abdullah on june 7 that pa's staff and volunteers did not find anything wrong with the standee as they might be ""blind to racism"". assistant professor walid had asked whether she would accept an invitation from mr yong to meet, if he made such an offer.  ms sarah replied she would, wondered if the mp had seen the standee, and added that ""something is definitely wrong"" if he had seen the standee and did not say anything about it. she also referred to someone's comment on internalised racism, and spoke on how some people are blind to racism, or feel there is nothing wrong with racism as it does not impact them. in its post, the pa stressed it remains steadfast in its mission to promote racial harmony, and that its grassroots organisations mesra and narpani pearavai play a key role in representing the interests of the malay and indian communities.  it also said that what happened at radin mas was an isolated incident, but nevertheless shows that it can fall short. ""we are now looking at establishing a resource panel to guide and advise our staff on cultural matters,"" it said.  ""we will also step up training efforts to enhance staff and volunteers' understanding and appreciation of our different cultures.  singaporeans becoming 'one people' is a work in progress and so is the pa. ""the pa added ms sarah's allegation in her june 1 e-mail, that it was ""hasty in sharing the name of the vendor"" to ""distance and deflect blame"" from itself, was untrue. it said the vendor had identified himself directly to ms sarah on may 28 and apologised, before the pa statement on may 29. the straits times has reached out to ms sarah for comment. ""enhancing our understanding of singapore's various races, religions and cultures is a ceaseless effort this lapse having been a good reminder of this,"" the pa said.

2021-06-17,"Hong Kong police raid pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily, arrest five.","keep up to speed at a glance with the top 10 daily storieshong kong national security police conducted a fresh raid on pro-democracy newspaper apple daily on thursday, arresting five executives and carting off computers in the latest blow to the outspoken tabloid. the paper and its jailed owner jimmy lai have long been a thorn in beijing's side with unapologetic support for the financial hub's pro-democracy movement and scathing criticism of china's authoritarian leaders. more than 500 officers conducted a dawn operation which authorities said was sparked by articles apple daily had published ""appealing for sanctions"" against hong kong and china's leaders. it is the first time the content of media reporting has sparked arrests under the national security law. in a message to readers, apple daily warned hong kong's press freedoms were ""hanging by a thread"", but vowed to ""stand tall"". its union described the operation as a ""wanton violation of press freedom"" that ""displayed how much police power has inflated under the national security law"". british foreign secretary dominic raab said china was using security legislation in hong kong to ""target dissenting voices, not tackle public security"". ""freedom of the press is one of the rights china promised to protect in the joint declaration & should be respected,"" he said, referring to the deal under which the city was returned to chinese rule in 1997. hong kong police said the five apple daily executives were arrested for collusion with a foreign country or external elements ""to endanger national security"". authorities also seized hk$18 million (us$2. 3 million) in apple daily assets, the first time a national security law seizure order has been made directly against a hong kong media company, rather than an individual. 'ominous' -hong kong has long been a major international media hub but its press freedom ranking has slipped dramatically in recent years. secretary for security john lee declined to say which articles breached the security law or whether those who shared the articles online, or bought apple daily or its shares might be at risk. ""our actions are not targeting press freedom or journalistic work,"" he added.  ""we target perpetrators who would use journalistic work as a tool to engage in acts that endanger national security. ""sharron fast, a lecturer at the university of hong kong's journalism school, described lee's comments as ""ominous and incorrect"". ""it is precisely the role of a journalist in a free society to report on political views, even those that might be unwelcome,"" she told afp. among the arrested executives were chief editor ryan law and ceo cheung kim-hung, who were both led into the building in handcuffs. hong kong's stock exchange said trading in shares of next digital -- the publisher of the newspaper -- had been halted. after the raid, reporters returned to a semi-gutted newsroom with the paper saying 38 computers were taken away as well as hard drives and reporters' notepads. a photographer, who gave just a nickname kt, said the latest operation had ""created terror for every apple daily worker"". ""if i get arrested for reporting the news, i will have no regrets,"" he told afp. executive chief editor lam man-chung, who was not among those arrested, told afp that staff would ""try all our best to publish newspapers for tomorrow"". crackdown -the security law is the speartip of a sweeping crackdown on beijing's critics in hong kong since 2019's huge democracy protests. it has criminalised much dissent, given china jurisdiction over some cases and awarded authorities a suite of powerful new investigation powers. those convicted face up to life in prison, and most are denied bail after arrest. thursday's raid was the second on apple daily in less than a year. the tabloid's billionaire owner lai, 73, was charged with collusion after hundreds of officers searched the paper's newsroom last august. he is currently serving multiple jail sentences for attending various protests. beijing has made no secret of its desire to tame the paper, with state media routinely describing lai as a ""traitor"" and a ""black hand"". last month, police used the national security law to freeze lai's bank accounts and his majority shares in next digital. until thursday's raid, authorities had left the company's assets alone.  it is unclear whether apple daily will now be able to pay its staff. china says the security law was needed to return stability to the international financial hub. critics, including many western nations, say it has been the final nail in the coffin for the ""one country, two systems"" promise that hong kong could maintain certain liberties after the 1997 handover. more than 100 people have been arrested under the law, many from among the city's best-known democracy activists.  others have fled overseas. su/jta/axn/legchina and other nations were attempting to ""seize control"" of strategically important international organisations so they could be ""weaponised"", a new report by the uk parliament's influential foreign affairs committee said.  the report, published thursday, accused china in particular of ""bullying"" states to back their position or their candidates for top jobs, using measures including financial leverage ""to shift policies away from the cooperation the organisations were created to promote"".  theif you're a foodie that's leaving the comforts of your home to try the hottest restaurant in town, here are the

2021-06-17,China set to launch first crew to new space station.,"beijing: the first astronauts for china's new space station are set to blast off on thursday (jun 17) for the country's longest crewed mission to date, a landmark step in establishing beijing as a major space power. the trio will launch on a long march-2f rocket for the tiangong station, where they will spend three months. liftoff is expected at 9. 22am local time from the jiuquan launch centre in northwest china's gobi desert. their shenzhou-12 spacecraft will dock with the tianhe main section of the space station, which was placed in orbit on apr 29. the module has separate living spaces for each of them, a treadmill for exercise, and a communication centre for emails and video calls with ground control. it is china's first crewed mission in nearly five years. the launch represents a matter of huge prestige in china, as beijing prepares to mark the 100th anniversary of the ruling communist party on july 1 with a massive propaganda campaign. to prepare for the mission, the crew has undergone more than 6,000 hours of training, including hundreds of underwater somersaults in full space gear. the mission's commander is nie haisheng, a decorated air force pilot in the people's liberation army who has already participated in two space missions. the two other members are also members of the military. over the next year and a half, another 11 missions are planned to complete the construction of tiangong in orbit. the first crew will test and maintain the systems onboard, conduct spacewalks and undertake scientific experiments. china's space ambitions have been fuelled in part by a us ban on its astronauts on the international space station, a collaboration between the united states, russia, canada, europe and japan. it is due for retirement after 2024, even though nasa said it could potentially remain functional beyond 2028. tiangong is to be much smaller than the iss, and expected to have a lifespan of at least 10 years. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-17,"Inside Hong Kong's Apple Daily, China's besieged liberal media icon, East Asia News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. hong kong (reuters) journalists at apple daily, a feisty hong kong newspaper, had been bracing for some kind of a crackdown. the splashy chinese-language tabloid which mixes celebrity gossip, investigations of the powerful and pro-democracy editorials has increasingly been under the scrutiny of the authorities since the arrest last august of its owner jimmy lai, who remains in jail for joining unauthorised rallies. still, thursday's (june 17) early-morning raid by 500 police officers was a shock, not only to apple daily staff but also to journalists throughout the city and, more broadly, people concerned about eroding press freedom in the former british colony. officers sealed off the block around the building housing the apple daily newsroom and printing press, emptied the newsroom and rifled through computers and desks. they arrested five executives, including the two top editors, on suspicion of ""colluding with foreign forces"".  scores of police milled about and swept the emptied newsroom for half a day, live feeds from expelled staff showed from outside. the raid, seizure of journalistic material and arrests of senior journalists, for alleged violations of a year-old security law imposed by beijing, is being widely seen as the most direct attack on hong kong's freewheeling media since beijing regained control of the city in 1997. now staff fear the 26-year-old paper could be closed, said two senior editors and mr mark simon, lai's right-hand man, who has fled abroad. persistent rumours that the authorities would try to ""shut down"" apple before july 1, when chinese president xi jinping leads celebrations for the communist party's centenary, seem more likely now, mr simon told reuters. ""i'm starting to think that,"" he said by phone from the united states. the newsroom began bracing for a crackdown after hong kong's police chief warned in april that media outlets that endanger national security through ""fake news"" would be investigated, said four apple daily reporters, ranging from junior to senior. morale suffered, and a handful of staff quit.  town hall meetings were held to reassure staff, and contingency plans laid. most staff received cards with lawyer contacts and assurances the company would back everyone legally.  news materials were firewalled or sent abroad to protect information and sources.

on the business side, with the company struggling financially and facing uncertainties over its building lease, non-core media businesses such as a charity fund run by lai were moved to separate offices, mr simon and another senior staff member said. apple daily's advocacy of democratic rights and freedoms has made it a thorn in beijing's side since lai, a self-made textiles tycoon known for a hip clothing chain, started it in 1995.  it shook up the region's chinese-language media landscape and became a democratic icon on the margins of communist china. hong kong's security chief, mr john lee, said those arrested were part of a ""conspiracy"" to make use of ""journalistic work"" to bring western sanctions on hong kong.  he added that the authorities respected media freedoms, but skirted a question on whether apple would be shut down. however, some hong kong insiders predict more moves. ""in china's mind, anything could endanger national interests, so they tighten everything,"" said a government official who deals with media issues.  ""and until everything is settled, they won't relax the process. ""last year's security law was beijing's first major move to put hong kong on an authoritarian path.  it punishes anything beijing deems as subversion, secessionism, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison. ""it will deepen jitters and uncertainties about whether hong kong is still a free city if the paper vanishes,"" mr chris yeung, head of the hong kong journalists' association, told reuters. mr ryan law, who became apple daily's editor in chief in 2018, a year before the city was roiled by anti-beijing protests, has said publicly he would not quit despite the risks. hours before his arrest, the bespectacled, mildly spoken editor and a deputy wrote in a letter to readers: ""we want to be a newspaper for the people of hong kong. ""

if anything, the paper's influence has been even broader.  it has served as a beacon of media freedoms in the chinese-speaking world, read by dissidents and a more liberal chinese diaspora repeatedly challenging beijing's rising authoritarianism. on june 4, when the authorities banned the annual candlelight vigil in downtown victoria park to commemorate the deadly 1989 tiananmen square crackdown in beijing, apple daily's front page the next day read: ""you can close victoria park.  but not lock people's hearts. ""some observers say the media crackdown could extend beyond apple, given china's unrelenting drive to wrest control over the city after protests in 2019. ""this is the first time a media organisation has been raided over the newspaper's output, though police won't clarify if it's over articles, opinion pieces or editorials,"" said mr tom grundy, editor in chief of independent online media outlet hong kong free press. ""the rules are unclear by design, as the security law is intended to make the media self-censor,"" he told reuters. but despite the raid, there were some signs of defiance at apple daily. the paper said it would print half a million copies of its newspaper on friday, more than five times the usual daily print run, in anticipation of strong public support for its plight. ""i will not quit at this moment,"" said a reporter who asked not to be identified.  ""i think as a journalist, i can't do anything to respond except to keep reporting.

2021-06-17,"How the centuries-old shipwrecks in Singapore waters were discovered, Singapore News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. two historical shipwrecks have been excavated from singapore's waters.  ceramic pieces dating back to the 14th century have been salvaged.  here are details of their discovery and their significance to the island city's maritime heritage. a singapore-registered barge carrying two bulk loader cranes encountered bad weather while on its way to kuantan and ran aground at pedra branca on dec 30, 2014. the two cranes were at risk of toppling onto pedra branca's famous horsburgh lighthouse, which was built in 1851. to prevent this from happening, dynamite was attached to the two cranes, and they were blown up while two boats pulled them away from the lighthouse, scattering metal into the sea. commercial divers were hired to clear the area of these scraps, said dr michael flecker, a visiting fellow at the iseas yusof ishak institute's (iseas) archaeology unit. it was while diving to retrieve the scraps in 2015 that mr ahmad qamarulhazman, a diver, stumbled upon a few old ceramic plates, and informed his manager mr ramdzan salim about them. mr ramdzan said he was sceptical of the find, given how close they were to the rocky seabed.  nevertheless, he asked mr ahmad to identify the area, and returned there when their tasks were finished, only to find more plates.

at around the same time, a 10-week-long archaeological dig was being carried out at a site in empress place. the divers, while following media coverage of the findings, realised that some plates retrieved near pedra branca looked very similar to artefacts retrieved in empress place, and decided to hand over the plates to the institute for further research and safekeeping. the rest is history.  upon iseas' confirmation that the plates were high quality celadon ceramics dated to the 14th century, the national heritage board partnered the institute to conduct a survey at the pedra branca site, discovering a shipwreck in 2016. mr ramdzan said on wednesday that he had a hunch that the finds were significant as he had previously participated in a privately-funded expeditions to recover centuries-old porcelains. asked if it crossed his mind to sell the artefacts he stumbled upon, he said getting the plates valued for sale would have been too time-consuming.  furthermore, he added that public education about singapore's history was the first thing on his mind, and handing over the plates was the right thing to do. mr ramdzan joined the iseas team on the initial survey in 2016, and subsequently participated as a volunteer on the excavations, further contributing to a project that was kick-started by his civic-minded decision to hand over the plates to the relevant bodies.

longquan celadon dishes, which have a green glaze, were recovered from the wreck.  similar plates have been found in mainland singapore.  st photo: gin tay
â¢ research has dated the ceramics, which formed the bulk of the items salvaged from this wreck, to the 14th and possibly 15th century. â¢ direct parallels were drawn between these finds, and those from the excavations at empress place and fort canning park in the past, making the shipwreck highly archaeologically and historically significant. â¢ findings will help to shed light on the maritime trading history of singapore, and how life was like here during the 14th-century temasek period.

â¢ following the end of excavation works for the first shipwreck, nhb and iseas conducted a survey around pedra branca and uncovered a second shipwreck dating to the late 18th century.  efforts were then made to excavate this shipwreck between 2019 and 2021. â¢ cargo likely from an india-built merchant vessel, the shah munchah, with remnants of the ship's hull.  the vessel sank in 1796 while on a voyage from china to india. â¢ diverse finds from this ship include both ceramics and non-ceramic objects. 
multiple figurines were found, including those of (from left) a chinese couple, a dog, and a qingbai figurine of a horse with a rider wearing a scholar's headgear.  photos: iseas yusof ishak institute
â¢ four anchors as long as 5m and weighing 2. 5 tonnes and nine cannon were recovered from the site.  the cannon were typically mounted on ships employed by the east india company in the 18th and early 19th centuries, and used for defence as well as signalling. â¢ findings will contribute to research on maritime trading activities around singapore's waters in the 18th century. 
a cannon is lifted off the seabed using a craned vessel.  photo: iseas yusof ishak institute
â¢ instruments like sonars are used to locate objects protruding from the seabed, while magnetometers are used to find iron objects. â¢ a modern ship, the mv yu seung ho, sank near the site of the second historic wreck in 1979, rendering the magnetometer useless for this survey as metal signatures were unusually high. â¢ divers went with old-school visual surveys to help find the second historic wreck. â¢ the site is mapped, including its size and the seabed material, so researchers know what excavation equipment to use. â¢ environmental conditions are determined to choose the right vessel and diving technique for the excavation.

â¢ a grid is set up on the seabed, and aligned with the ship's keel if one still remains.  no hull was found for the first wreck, while just remnants of the second vessel's hull remained. â¢ dredging devices, which act like underwater vacuums, are used to unearth artefacts. â¢ recording is done through various means like photos, videos and sketches. â¢ collected artefacts are logged according to their grid numbers, while the precise location within the grid is recorded for unique pieces. â¢ important pieces are packed in bubble wrap, while others are placed in boxes and taken to the storage facility.

â¢ ceramics and glass are desalinated and stabilised by leaching out salts through a simple process of replacing the water they are soaked in. â¢ metals are placed in a chemical solution. â¢ organic materials are reinforced if possible. 
retrieved artefacts have to go through conservation treatment after they are collected.  photo: iseas yusof ishak institute
â¢ ceramics are divided into types, like blue and white, or greenware, and also by the kilns they came from if possible. â¢ artefact information is put into a database, and this is linked to the grid square it was found in, allowing for easy counting. â¢ distribution how much of each type of artefact was found in different areas over the wreck is studied. â¢ cataloguing is the final stage, where all the types and quantities of artefacts are listed. â¢ using distribution information, how the ship was wrecked can be analysed, much like detective work. â¢ artefacts are identified and dated, which is especially important for items that are no longer being used today. â¢ findings are compared with existing literature.  chinese and indian texts may shed light on the identity of the first shipwreck, while multiple sources like company records and newspaper reports will help identify the second shipwreck. â¢ new revelations may be discovered.  for instance, unexpected items like a tambourine and shakers were found in the second shipwreck. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright Â© 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-17,JTC and Shell Singapore sign MOU to explore development of solar farm on Semakau Landfill.,"singapore: jtc corporation and shell singapore have signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding (mou) to jointly explore the development of a solar farm on part of semakau landfill, both parties announced in a press release on thursday (jun 17). the mou is supported by the national environment agency (nea) and energy market authority (ema) and was signed at a ceremony on thursday morning. the solar farm is expected to occupy an area of 60ha and have a capacity of at least 72 megawatt-peak, which is enough to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 37,000 tonnes a year, said the four parties in a joint press release. the energy produced can power up to 17,500 households for a year. the farm will also be the first large-scale solar project in singapore where a sanitary landfill is also used for clean energy generation.  this project is aligned with singapore's target to increase solar deployment to at least 2 gigawatt-peak by 2030. if successful, the farm will also help reduce singapore's carbon emissions and meet its growing clean energy needs, noted the press release. ""generating solar energy on this scale on an offshore operational landfill comes with its fair share of complexity and challenges.  this is where the innovation and creativity of a joint task force made up of the various government agencies and shell come into play, to ensure that an optimal balance is achieved,"" said the press release. ""close collaborations"" like these are part of jtc's solarland initiative to optimise available land for solar generation in support of singapore's clean energy switch, said jtc ceo tan boon khai. ""jtc is piloting new sustainable energy innovations with shell to maximise the use of renewable energy solutions for our industries.  this project is an example of how we are tapping available land to double up for solar generation to maximise renewable energy generation,"" he said. ms aw kah peng, who is chairman of shell companies in singapore, noted that the project is aligned with the company's 10-year plan to re-purpose its core business, cut down on its own carbon dioxide emissions and help customers decarbonise. ""with a common goal of enabling more and cleaner energy, we look forward to exploring with our partners this opportunity to maximise the use of semakau in a way that is compatible with its primary purpose as a landfill,"" she added. shell's pulau bukom energy and chemicals park is also located about 2km northwest of the semakau landfill and working together would allow an ""innovative integration"" of an intermittent renewable source to bukom, added the release. nea chief executive officer luke goh noted that the plans will contribute towards the national solar deployment target and complement nea's resource sustainability initiatives. ""nea is happy to support the deployment of a solar farm on semakau landfill,"" he added. ""semakau landfill remains singapore's only operational landfill.  to preserve its capacity for as long as possible, we are redoubling efforts to reduce waste and close the waste loop. ""ema chief executive ngiam shih chun described solar energy as singapore's ""most promising renewable energy source"" and a ""key switch"" for decarbonisation. ""our energy sector is moving towards a cleaner and more sustainable future,"" he noted. ""given our limited land space, ema has been working with government agencies and industry players on innovative ways to harness more solar energy.  i look forward to the successful implementation of this offshore solar farm on semakau landfill which will demonstrate how we can be creative in our solar deployment.

""we expect all educators to conduct themselves to the highest standards of their profession, given their position of influence over their students, and we will not hesitate to take the appropriate disciplinary actions against offenders,"" the spokesman said. ""our schools aim to provide a supportive and safe environment where students and staff, regardless of their race and religion, can build strong and positive relationships, voice their concerns, and seek help from their teachers and peers. ""the ministry said schools here provide a common space for students to learn the values of respect and harmony, regardless of race, language or religion. the spokesman added: ""within the classroom, topics on multiculturalism and the importance of racial harmony are taught in subjects like character and citizenship education, history and social studies. ""these values are practised and reinforced beyond the classroom as students interact with one another during student development experiences like cca and cohort camps. ""the moe also said that teachers are provided with resources and training to establish a caring and enabling environment in school by fostering strong teacher-student and peer relationships. all schools will have a peer support structure in place by the end of this year, where students can support one another and are taught to speak up for peers when necessary, the ministry added. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright Â© 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

""in upholding the king's decrees, the government will take follow-up measures based on the federal constitution and the state laws,"" the statement read. the special rulers' conference came after the king granted audiences to 18 key political leaders, who presented their views on the pandemic management and the country's current situation. the king said parliament meetings should be held to enable the emergency ordinances and the national recovery plan to be debated by parliamentarians. the malay rulers added that there wasno need to further extend malaysia's state of emergencybeyond aug 1. on wednesday night, de facto law minister takiyuddin hassan said that although the king had called for parliament to reconvene as soon as possible, no specific date had been specified. ""the prime minister has already stated september or october,"" mr takiyuddin, who is also parti islam se-malaysia (pas) secretary-general, said during an online interview on the bicara harakah talk show. the minister in the prime minister's department added that a parliament sitting would definitely be convened ""in three months' time"". on tuesday, mr muhyiddin said in a televised address that the parliament meeting could be held during the third phase of the national recovery plan, which is likely to happen inseptember or octoberthis year. in his response to the rulers' statement, the deputy president of the united malays national organisation (umno), mohammad hassan said that it was necessary for the government to convene parliament sessions as soon as possible.

""the government's announcement in the national recovery plan that parliament can reopen come september or october is not a guarantee,"" said mr mohammad. such a reopening, he said, was subject to various conditions including drops in the number of daily new cases, and an increase in the vaccination rates. ""whatever excuse to delay the reopening of parliament is not just anti-democratic, but also touches the sanctity and wisdom of the royal institution, which is free and above politics,"" he added. the opposition pakatan harapan coalition also called on mr muhyiddin to advise the king to reconvene parliament at the soonest. ""if the prime minister continues to dally, or gives excuses to delay parliament session, it does not just mean he has set aside his majesty's view.  it also gives the impression that the prime minister has lost confidence to continue governing,"" said the ph statement. it added that if the prime minister still refuses to advise the king soon, he should take the honorable step by resigning. among state governments, selangor chief minister amirudin shari announced on thursday that he would meet with the state assembly speaker to begin plans to reconvene the legislature, including obtaining assent from the state ruler. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

COVID-19 origins probe should shift to U.S., says China disease expert.","

  senior chinese epidemiologist said the united states should be the priority inthe next phase of investigations into the origin of covid-19 after a study showed the disease could have been circulating there as early as december 2019, state media said on thursday. the study, published this week by the u. s.  national institutes for health (nih), showed that at least seven people in five u. s.  states were infected with sars-cov-2, the virus that causes covid-19, weeks before the united states reported its first official cases. a china-world health organization (who) joint study published in march said covid-19 most likely originated in the country's wildlife trade, with the virus passing into humans from bats via an intermediary species. but beijing has promoted the theory that covid-19 entered china from overseas via contaminated frozen food, while a number of foreign politicians are also calling for more investigations into the possibility it leaked from a laboratory. zeng guang, chief epidemiologist with the chinese center for disease control and prevention, told state-owned tabloid the global times that attention should shift to the united states, which was slow to test people in the early stages of the outbreak, and is also the home of many biological laboratories. ""all bio-weapons related subjects that the country has should be subject to scrutiny,"" he was quoted as saying. commenting on the u. s.  study on wednesday, foreign ministry spokesman zhao lijian said it was now ""obvious"" the covid-19 outbreak had ""multiple origins"" and that other countries should co-operate with the who. the origin of the pandemic has become a source of political tension between china and the united states, with much of the recent focus on the wuhan institute of virology (wiv), located in wuhan where the outbreak was first identified in late 2019. china has been criticised for its lack of transparency when it comes to disclosing data about early cases as well as the viruses studied at wiv. a report by a u. s.  government national laboratory concluded that it was plausible that the virus had leaked from the wuhan lab, the wall street journal reported earlier this month. a previous study has raised the possibility that sars-cov-2 could have been circulating in europe as early as september, but experts said this didn't necessarily mean it did not originate in china, where many sars-like coronaviruses have been found in the wild.

2021-06-17,Football: Denmark's Eriksen to get heart starter implant after collapse on pitch.,"copenhagen: denmark's christian eriksen will get a heart starter device implanted after his collapse during denmark's euro 2020 opener on saturday (jun 12), the team's national team doctor said in a statement on thursday. ""after christian has been through different heart examinations it has been decided that he should have an icd (heart starter),"" doctor morten boesen said. he added that such a device is necessary after a cardiac attack due to rhythm disturbances. gunnar gislason, head of research at the danish heart foundation and a professor of cardiology, told reuters that a return to elite sport after the insertion of an icd is possible. ""it really depends on the condition you are treating, what kind of heart disease you are suffering from, that's very individual, (but) there are examples of top athletes that have come back to the field and restart normal activity,"" he said. the operation to insert an icd takes one to two hours and is done under local anaesthetic, gislason explained, with patients usually kept in an extra day to calibrate the unit and ensure there are no issues with its operation. ""it's like a monitor, it monitors the rhythm of the heart.  for most people, they will never have to use it, but for those who maybe have a serious cardiac arrhythmia or cardiac arrest, the icd can detect it and respond to it,"" gislason said. daley blind, a former team mate of eriksen's at ajax amsterdam, had an icd fitted after collapsing in a friendly against hertha berlin in 2020 and was part of the netherlands side that faced ukraine less than 24 hours after eriksen's collapse. after the game blind spoke of his distress at seeing his friend fall to the ground, saying ""it made me sleep badly and also really think about not playing, it was a big mental hurdle to overcome, but i'm glad i did. ""blind's career could have ended following his own collapse, but doctors inserted an icd and he was cleared to return to football. ""it (the icd) has two main functions.  it can try to override the fast heart rhythm and in that way take control of the rhythm of the heart and then slowly go down and restore the normal heart rhythm,"" gislason explained. ""if it doesn't succeed with that, it will give a shock, like a normal defibrillator, and it will try to regenerate a normal heart rhythm in that way, so it's a life-saving device for those who have a serious cardiac arrhythmia or cardiac arrest. ""danish fans at radhuspladsen in copenhagen on thursday were unanimous in their desire to see eriksen back on the field. ""christian eriksen has to play he's a national symbol, a legend, so of course i want him to play,"" anton olesen told reuters ahead of denmark's second group b game against belgiumit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-17,Centuries-old shipwrecks found off Singapore.,"two centuries-old shipwrecks packed with ceramics and other artefacts have been found off singapore in a rare discovery that will shed light on the city-state's maritime heritage, archaeologists said wednesday. the prosperous island nation has long been a key trading hub on global shipping routes connecting the indian ocean and the south china sea. the wrecks were found off pedra branca, a rocky outcrop east of singapore, according to the national heritage board and think tank the iseas-yusof ishak institute, which worked together on the project. the first wreck, discovered after divers accidentally came across ceramic plates in 2015, was carrying chinese ceramics that possibly date back to the 14th century, when singapore was known as temasek. some of the items were similar to artefacts found in archaeological digs on land, which showed that singapore was a trading hub well before the arrival of british colonisers in 1819. undersea excavations on the first wreck led to the discovery of the second, which is likely to be the shah munchah, a merchant vessel built in india that sank in 1796 while sailing from china to india. items recovered from the second wreck ranged from chinese ceramics to glass and agate objects, as well anchors and cannons, the heritage board and think tank said. the survey and recovery of artefacts from the two wrecks was completed this year. such cannons were typically mounted on merchant ships used by the east india company --- the trading behemoth through which the british empire expanded in asia -- in the 18th and 19th centuries, they added. the vessel discovered in 2015 was the first ancient shipwreck to be found in singapore's waters. it was carrying ""more yuan dynasty blue-and-white porcelain than any other documented shipwreck in the world,"" said michael flecker, a visiting fellow at the iseas-yusof ishak institute's archaeology unit. ""many of the pieces are rare, and one is believed to be unique. ""the yuan dynasty existed in what is now china in the 13th and 14th centuries. much of the chinese cargo in the second wreck was destined for eventual shipping to britain, said flecker. mba/sr/qanformer taiwanese president ma ying-jeou has called on the government to listen to public opinion and allow civilian groups which have different political leanings to the ruling democratic progressive party to import much-needed covid-19 vaccines.  taiwan, which is battling a surge in cases, has struggled to secure vaccines although it has signed deals to buy 10 million doses from astrazeneca, 5 million from moderna and more than 4. 7 million doses via the covax facility, which is supported by thechina and other nations were attempting to ""seize control"" of strategically important international organisations so they could be ""weaponised"", a new report by the uk parliament's influential foreign affairs committee said.  the report, published thursday, accused china in particular of ""bullying"" states to back their position or their candidates for top jobs, using measures including financial leverage ""to shift policies away from the cooperation the organisations were created to promote"".  themeet the paypal business debit card.  use it everywhere mastercardÂ® is accepted. if you're a foodie that's leaving the comforts of your home to try the hottest restaurant in town, here are the credit cards you should have in your wallet.  if there's one thing singaporeans love more than good food, it's good food deals.  whether you're [. . . ] the post best dining credit cards in singapore (2021) appeared first on singsaver blog we compare, you save. browsing property ads? from exaggerated headlines like ""over 90% units sold!"" to too-good-to-be-true prices under market value, here are 6 things to look out for when shopping for a new home. the pla's largest sortie into taiwan's air defence identification zone marked another step forward by the chinese military because it was the first of its kind on the eastern side of the island, according to military analysts.  that side is the furthest from mainland china and hosts two major airbases that could play a key role in any invasion and are sheltered by the mountain ranges in the centre of the island.  derek grossman, a senior defence analyst at the rand corporation, a us think tank, sanew $89 portable air cooler everyone in the u. s.  is talking abouta reporter with a pro-beijing newspaper in hong kong accused of making a false statement when accessing a government car registry has been let off the hook after prosecutors agreed to drop the charge on condition of a binding-over order.  the prosecution's decision stood in marked contrast to the justice department's handling of a case last year involving an rthk contributor accused of the same act, prompting principal magistrate ivy chui yee-mei to question the difference in approach at thursdaybeijing said on wednesday it did not fear the relationship between the united states and the european union after the two sides announced they would set up a body to write economic rules and take other steps to face rising competition from china.  a statement by the chinese diplomatic mission at the eu said china was standing up and was not afraid of threats, saying the eu-us summit had gone far beyond the ""norm of developing bilateral relations . . .  it is filled with an outdated cold war mentalitythe scientific community should find ways to overcome political divides and push for more collaboration in space exploration, as well as solve global problems by making use of china's new space station, a hong kong-based space expert says.  professor quentin parker, head of the laboratory for space research at the university of hong kong, made the remarks ahead of china's first crewed space flight in nearly five years, with three astronauts expected to travel to its new tiangong space station forlastpass protects every access point through an all-in-one single sign-on, password management and mfa solution. washington will use its leverage in the united nations to counter china's harmful influence, stem beijing's strategic grip over un agencies and build an alliance to investigate the source of covid-19 and address human rights abuses in xinjiang, a senior us official told congress on wednesday.

""the people's food situation is now getting tense as the agricultural sector failed to fulfill its grain production plan due to the damage by typhoons last year,"" kim said. the party vowed to direct all efforts to farming this year and discuss ways to tackle the covid-19 pandemic, kcna said. kim called for steps to minimise impacts of natural disasters as a lesson from last year and key to attain this year's goal. in january, kim said his previous five-year economic plan had failed in almost every sector, amid chronic power and food shortages exacerbated by sanctions, the pandemic and floods. he also said the protracted pandemic required the party to step up efforts to provide food, clothing and housing for the people, kcna said. north korea has not officially confirmed any covid-19 cases, a claim questioned by seoul officials.  but the reclusive country has imposed strict anti-virus measures including border closures and domestic travel restrictions. covax, a global initiative for sharing covid-19 vaccines with poor countries, has said it will provide nearly 2 million doses to north korea but the shipment has been delayed amid protracted consultations. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

major spoilers follow for loki episode 2 on disney plusspoilers follow for loki episodes 1 and 2. loki on disney plus isn't hanging around with its big character reveals.  episode 2 of marvel's latest tv show has only just been released but, unlike wandavision or falcon and the winter soldier, we aren't being made to wait for surprise character introductions.  we already knew that loki (tom hiddleston) would run into another loki 'time variant'.  agent mobius (owen wilson) stated as much in episode 1's final scene â but we didn't expect the identity of this other loki 'time variant' to be revealed so soon. we imagine you have questions about this character, so we're here to help.  below, we'll dive into their comic book history and which actor portrays them in the series.  we also look at what their introduction may mean for the show moving forward and why this character may not actually be who we think it is. we're entering major spoiler territory for loki episode 2 from this point on.  if you haven't watched it all the way through yet, turn back now.  after tracking down the 'variant' to a world-ending event in 2050, loki, mobius and a tva squad split up to cover more ground and locate them. loki pairs up with hunter b-15 (wunmi mosaku) and the duo soon encounter a single male, who is inexplicably shopping for plants as a massive storm rages outside. when hunter b-15 moves closer to interrogate him further, however, the male grabs b-15's arm and seemingly transfers his consciousness into her. yep, the person hiding inside the man (who transfers themselves into hunter b-15) is none other than the loki 'variant'. the two versions of loki verbally lock horns (all the while the loki 'variant' continues to transfer themselves into other human vessels, to keep things interesting) before their plan is revealed. after stealing enough of the tva's time reset charges â the devices that destroy offshoot branches from the sacred timeline â the loki 'variant' plans to activate them all at once.  creating a massive surge in nexus events, multiple timelines will branch off from the sacred timeline, cause reality to break down and presumably lead to a new multiversal war, as alluded to in episode 1. before setting their scheme in motion, though, the loki 'variant' finally reveals who they are â lady loki.  yes, you read that right: a female version of loki. lady loki's reset charges activate, they travel to different dimensions in time and cause multiple branches to branch off from the sacred timeline.  lady loki leaves through her own time travel doorway and, despite mobius' last-ditch attempts to stop him, loki follows his namesake through the portal, presumably to get to the bottom of who they really are. sophia di martino.  the british actress, who has appeared in tv shows including silent witness, was rumored to be playing lady loki in marvel's latest series, and now we have confirmation that she is. as loki's tv show was being filmed, leaked on-set images appeared to show di martino in a very loki-like costume.  at the time, we speculated that this was who di martino would be in the series, and we're glad to see we were right.  lady loki is a fairly new addition to marvel comics.  created for a 2008 thor comic issue run by j.  michael stracynski, lady loki is, well, loki reborn in female form. lady loki emerged following marvel comics' version of ragnarok, and went on to be the primary version of loki through several other comic storylines including dark reign, new avengers and original sin. as it turns out, lady loki hadn't replaced the male loki that comic readers had known since his first appearance in october 1962's journey into mystery #85 comic.  lady loki is loki and, instead of being one of his many tricks, lady loki is one of many of the character's personae. this, in turn, led to the revelation that loki is genderfluid.  lady loki, then, retains the personality, mischievous ways, abilities and other traits that loki has â the only difference is that this iteration of the character is female instead of male. it's a part of the character that has been adopted in the mcu, too.  as episode 1's end titles sequence (and the official loki twitter account) revealed, the tva has a file on loki that confirms the character is genderfluid. given episode 2's events, we can safely assume that loki will follow lady loki across multiple realities (as we've seen in the trailers) to discover the reason behind their universe-ending plan. our guess is that the tva betrayed lady loki and she's exacting revenge by destroying the so-called sacred timeline. after all, there's something shady about the tva.  maybe they offered lady loki a similar deal to the one that mobius gave loki (an audience with the time keepers) and then reneged on that agreement once they had used lady loki for whatever they needed. if that is the case â and this is purely speculation on our part â we could see a tug of war, between lady loki and the tva, play out for loki's loyalty. loki will be aware that, if he crosses the tva, he'll lose the opportunity to potentially speak with the time keepers.  there's also the fact that the tva will delete him from existence so, theoretically, it's in his best interests to remain loyal to them. however, loki is a schemer â so lady loki, by definition, should be, too.  the latter could conceivably persuade hiddleston's loki to join her cause instead, enlist his help in causing multiversal mayhem and they could rule the marvel cinematic multiverse (mcm) together in some way. loki's trailer appeared to show the pair having a (potentially pleasant) chat on an unknown planet.  of course, we don't know when this conversation will take place in loki's tv show but, for all intents and purposes, it seems to be pretty civil.  if it is, this could be when loki joins forces with lady loki to take on the tva. alternatively, it may be that di martino's character isn't, in fact, lady loki at all. according to episode 2's end credits, di martino is playing a character called sylvie â and this individual is completely different from lady loki in marvel comics. how do we know di martino's character is called sylvie? take a look at the castellana dubbed voice actors' roster right at the end of episode 2.  you'll see someone else (elisa beuter) voicing di martino's character, who is referred to as sylvie:hang on, how do we know beuter is the voice actor dub for di martino? take a look at the german language dub image below, and you'll see sonja spuhl voices a character called 'the variant'.  this has to be the same character as sylvie, as both characters are second only to loki in their cast order importance:if di martino's character is called sylvie, there's only one marvel comic character that this can be referencing: sylvie lushton, aka enchantress. in the comics, sylvie is an average teenage girl living in oklahoma until the asgardians move their asgard home to the same state.  not long after, sylvie wakes up with magical powers and adopts the pseudonym enchantress â a character who is as much of an anti-hero/villain as loki. as it turns out, sylvie obtains her powers from loki, including sorcery, teleportation and telekinesis.  judging by the first two episodes of loki, we've seen di martino's character use similar abilities to possess people and, well make her hands glow green. it's highly plausible, then, that this is enchantress and not lady loki as we first suspected.  as far as we're aware, enchantress doesn't wear a crown with two horns (a la loki) in the comics, but di martino is sporting such a head accessory in loki episode 2.  this certainly muddies the waters as to who di martino is actually playing.  whatever happens, or whoever di martino is portraying, it'll be interesting to see how the rest of loki's tv series plays out.  there are bound to be more twists along the way and we can't wait to see what occurs. sign up to get breaking news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more, plus the hottest tech deals!thank you for signing up to techradar.  you will receive a

2021-06-17,Integrated Shield Plans to cover hospitalisation for COVID-19 vaccines brought in under special access route.,"singapore: all seven insurers offering integrated shield plans are extending their coverage of hospitalisation resulting from covid-19 vaccine complications to include vaccines brought in under the special access route, such as the sinovac jab. this will apply to policyholders who receive covid-19 vaccines that are approved by the world health organization (who) under its emergency use listing and administered in singapore under the special access route, said the life insurance association, singapore (lia singapore). the additional coverage will be provided until dec 31, said the association on thursday (jun 17). it added that it will work with insurers for any consideration of extensions to the duration of coverage, alongside monitoring the evolving covid-19 situation. currently,only the sinovac vaccineis administered under the special access route, which allows private healthcare institutions to bring in unregistered covid-19 vaccines. vaccines brought in under the special access route must be on the who's emergency use listing.  the listing also includes shots by johnson & johnson, astrazeneca and sinopharm. hospitalisation for complications arising from the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines, which have been approved by singapore's health sciences authority and are part of the country's national inoculation programme, isalready covered under integrated shield plans.  both are messenger rna (mrna) vaccines. ""we understand that some singaporeans may wish to receive vaccination under (the special access route) and hope that our member insurers' proactive commitment in extending inpatient hospitalisation benefits for complications can provide assurance that such (integrated shield plan) policyholders will be covered,"" said lia singapore president khor hock seng. the sinovac jab, an inactivated virus vaccine, is free for those who were previously rejected from taking the mrna vaccines due to severe allergies or allergic reactions to the first dose.  others who prefer the sinovac vaccine for non-medical reasons pay an administrative fee to the private healthcare providers. those who take the sinovac vaccine are not covered under the vaccine injury financial assistance programme for covid-19 vaccination. integrated shield plans are made up of two components â medishield life run by the central provident fund board and an additional private insurance coverage component run by insurance companies.  the latter covers hospitalisation in a- and b1-type wards in public hospitals as well as private hospitals. insurers offering integrated shield plans are: aia, aviva, axa, great eastern life, ntuc income, prudential and raffles health insurance. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-17,"Denmark vs Belgium EURO 2020 Odds, Tips & Predictionâ17 JUNE 2021.","

denmark lost their first game and must now take points to stay in the playoff race.  will the danes make headlines or will we see another routine victory for the belgians? our money is on the second choice. denmark have a strong squad besides christian eriksen: braithwaite, dolberg, hojbjerg, poulsen, delaney, kjaer, christensen, westergaard and schmeichel.  but unfortunately, this set of players wasn't enough to defeat the finns, who lost 0-1.  the danes were memorable for their 22 shots on goal and 70% possession.  the finns, on the other hand, needed just one attack to take away the three points.  this was made possible by the unreliable play of kasper schmeichel.  it is worth recalling that, one week before the euro, the danes managed to draw with the germans 1-1.  therefore, we cannot rule out miracles in this team's performance. we didn't see the full extent of belgium's brilliance because of the generosity of the russian defenders, especially andrei semyonov.  romelu lukaku and thomas meunier took advantage of it, as he replaced the injured timothy castagne in the first half.  in total, it was a 3-0 win.  the belgians will now face denmark, whom they defeated in the last round of the nations league.  roberto martinez will certainly have to put a lot of effort into preparing and analysing his opponent. we believe that belgium must win again beautifully.  moreover, the tournament has just begun, and it is too early for the belgians to relax.  that is why our bet on the match is belgium's victory for 2. 11.  we also think that goals will be scored by both sides, as the danes will fight for the win doubly for christian eriksen and recovery from the loss to the finns.  therefore, we suggest betting on both to score yes for 1. 98. 
in conclusion, we are confident that romelu lukaku will score another goal at the euro.  he is in the unstoppable form right now, so we are waiting for the continuation.  marathonbet gives odds of 2. 25 for his goal.

2021-06-17,Xi Taps Top Deputy to Lead Chinaâs Chip Battle Against U.S.,"chinese president xi jinping is renewing his years-long push to achieve technology self-sufficiency by tapping a top deputy to shepherd a key initiative aimed at helping domestic chipmakers overcome u. s.  sanctions. liu he, xi's economic czar whose sprawling portfolio spans trade to finance and technology, has been tapped to spearhead the development of so-called third-generation chip development and capabilities and is leading the formulation of a series of financial and policy supports for the technology, according to people with knowledge of the matter. it's a nascent field that relies on newer materials and gear beyond traditional silicon and is currently an arena where no company or nation yet dominates, offering beijing one of its best chances to sidestep the hurdles slapped on its chipmaking industry by the u. s.  and its allies.  the sanctions, which emerged during donald trump's presidency, have already smothered huawei technologies co. 's smartphone business and will impede longer-term efforts by chipmakers from huawei's hisilicon to semiconductor manufacturing international corp.  to migrate toward more advanced wafer fabrication technologies, threatening china's technological ambitions. ""china is the world's largest user of chips, so supply chain security is of high priority,"" said gu wenjun, chief analyst at research firm icwise.  ""it's not possible for any country to control the entire supply chain, but a country's effort is definitely stronger than a single company. ""the involvement of one of xi's most-trusted lieutenants in china's chip efforts highlights the importance accorded by beijing to the initiative, which is gaining urgency as rivals from the u. s.  to japan and south korea scramble to shore up their own industries.  the chinese president has long called upon his harvard-educated adviser to tackle matters of top national priority, making him the chief representative in trade negotiations with the u. s.  as well as chairman of the financial stability and development committee, where liu leads the charge to curb risks in the nation's $5-trillion-plus financial sector. in may, liu spearheaded a meeting of the technology task force that discussed ways to grow next-generation semiconductor technologies, according to a government statement.  the 69-year-old vice premier, who has led the country's technology reform task force since 2018, is also overseeing projects that could lead to breakthroughs in traditional chipmaking, including the development of china's own chip design software and extreme ultraviolet lithography machines, one of the people said, asking not to be identified as they weren't authorized to speak to media. the state council and the ministry of industry and information technology didn't respond to faxed requests for comment. during trade negotiations with the trump administration, liu emerged as one of the most visible advocates of beijing's agenda.  he's known xi since childhood -- both are sons of veteran communist party leaders and were among masses of young people dispatched to work in impoverished rural areas during the cultural revolution.  now, liu is leading the charge to reform the tech sector, which was identified in china's latest five-year economic plan as a key strategic area in which the ""whole nation system"" should be used to mobilize any necessary resources. first introduced under mao zedong to help the then-fledgling communist china industrialize, the approach was crucial to helping beijing attain a number of top national priorities, from developing its first atomic bomb in the early 1960s to achieving olympic sporting success.  after that it was largely set aside as officials shifted to focus on economic growth.  but following a series of u. s.  sanctions that exposed the vulnerabilities of china's chip capabilities, xi is once again reactivating the mechanism to achieve breakthroughs in advanced chip development and manufacturing. about a trillion dollars of government funding have been set aside under the technology initiative, part of which will be used by central and local governments to jointly invest in a series of third-generation chip projects, according to people with knowledge of the matter.  top chipmakers and research institutes have submitted proposals to the ministries of science and information technology, all vying for a place in the national program and a share of the financing.  the ministry of science and technology is slated to inject 400 million yuan ($62 million) into some key ""strategic electronics materials"" including third-generation chips, according to a government document. even moonshot chip programs are in line for government funding.  the state-backed national natural science foundation of china has pledged financial support for dozens of exploratory research programs, ranging from ultra-low power consumption to the development of a flexible chip that can collect and transmit nerve signals, as beijing seeks to overcome ""computing bottlenecks"" when moore's law -- the industry standard for predicting the pace of chip improvements -- finally stops working. several subsidiaries of china electronics technology group corp.  and china railway construction corp.  -- organizations already sanctioned by the u. s.  -- are among the state-backed firms backing the effort, one of the people said.  another government-linked giant, china electronics corp. , is one of the leaders in third-generation chip development, thanks to its investment in smaller firms including cec semiconductor co.  using its own in-house technology, cec semiconductor makes silicone carbide-based power devices that can work at 200 degrees celsius (360 degrees fahrenheit) for a number of key industries from telecommunications to electric cars -- reducing china's reliance on overseas suppliers such as infineon technologies ag, rohm co.  and cree inc. shares of chipmakers climbed, with smic rallying more than 8% in shanghai, set for its biggest one-day gain since october.  shares of national silicon industry group co. , will semiconductor co.  and maxscend microelectronics co.  also advanced.  sanan optoelectronics co.  and wingtech technology co.  -- among firms seen as potential beneficiaries of china's third-generation chip effort -- gained 10% and 8%, respectively. the task of coordinating that sprawling program now falls to liu, who has to keep track of the relevant resources and drive the national strategy to help china achieve chip independence. ""for our country, technology and innovation is not just a matter of growth,"" liu told a three-story auditorium packed with china's top scientists in a separate meeting in may.  ""it's also a matter of survival.

2021-06-17,"'Oh sh*t, I'm only 29 years old!'.","the first words of christian eriksen after he saw his life saved by medics during denmark's clash with finland at euro 2020 have been revealed, with the inter star telling doctors on the back of suffering cardiac arrest: ""oh sh*t, i'm only 29 years old. ""the danish playmaker collapsed in copenhagen on saturday and had to be resuscitated on the field after quick thinking from his team-mates and doctors. he is now on the road to recovery, as he remains in hospital, but suffered a serious and unexpected health scare as a professional sportsman that was seemingly in peak physical condition. german doctor jens kleinefeld, who helped deliver the shock that restarted eriksen's heart, has told bild on bringing the dane back: ""i was sitting in the stands on the opposite side when eriksen collapsed.  i didn't think anything of it at first.  but then i saw the danish team doctor acting relatively frantically, i realised it was not a normal injury. ""i messaged the sideline team and they ran onto the field.  they had the defibrillator with them.  i then told my colleague in the stands that we had to get onto the pitch. ""the danish team doctor initially had difficulty fully grasping the situation.  when you start reanimation, you have to do it as quickly as possible.  but the team doctors mainly treat all kinds of injuries, so it's more difficult for them to recognise cardiac death directly. ""we have already seen that when they tried to pull the tongue out of the throat.  that is nonsense, of course and doesn't save a life.  a minimal hyperextension of the head is quite sufficient. ""within the first two minutes, the shock should be delivered.  with eriksen, it took two or three minutes.  that's when the chance of survival is very high.  if the shock is delivered within the first two minutes, then the chance of survival is almost 90 per cent.  the chance of survival drops 10 per cent per minute.  we had to hurry. ""after two minutes, i saw that the shock was successful.  then it took another 20 or 30 seconds for eriksen's consciousness to return.

""he had also tried, but failed, to secure employment in the singapore government sector to further his information-gathering activities,"" the department added. the isd said its investigations are still ongoing and yeo's continued detention is necessary ""to facilitate probes into the full extent of his activities"". ""the singapore government takes a very serious view of anyone who enters into a clandestine relationship with a foreign government and engages in activities at the behest of the foreign power that is inimical to our national security and interests, including bilateral relations,"" the department added. yeo was a doctoral candidate at the national university of singapore's lee kuan yew school of public policy (lkyspp) when he was recruited by chinese intelligence officers after a 2015 trip to beijing to give a presentation on the political situation in southeast asia. he was first arrested by american counterintelligence officers in november 2019.  he pleaded guilty in july last year to one charge of operating illegally as a foreign agent, and admitted to working between 2015 and 2019 for chinese intelligence ""to spot and assess americans with access to valuable non-public information, including us military and government employees with high-level security clearances"". a few days after he entered his plea, lkyspp said it had terminated yeo's phd candidature with immediate effect.  yeo had enrolled as a phd student there in 2015 and was granted a leave of absence in 2019. in october last year, yeo was jailed for 14 months in the us for passing to the chinese government valuable, but unclassified, military and political information that he had duped a number of americans into giving him.  prosecutors said that yeo was motivated by monetary gain and a shared desire with china to weaken the global standing of the us.  among the information yeo handed over to china were reports on a military aircraft program, us troop withdrawal in afghanistan and on a us cabinet member, who was not identified in court documents. ""i take full responsibility for what i have done,"" yeo reportedly said during sentencing.  ""i am sympathetic to china's position, but it was not my intention to harm anyone. ""in a statement announcing his arrest upon his return to singapore in december last year, singapore's ministry of home affairs said, ""singapore will not allow our nationals to be subverted or used by any foreign actors for activities prejudicial to our security and national interests.

2021-06-17,The eternal captain: 'Legend' doesn't do justice to Ramos' legacy at Real Madrid.,"sergio ramos may be leaving real madrid, but what he has achieved at santiago bernabeu is written indelibly into the club's history. one of the game's biggest personalities, brimming with ego but boasting the quality to back it up, ramos will end an era in white on thursday. whatever explanation ramos gives at his goodbye press conference, however twisted and taut the relationship between the defender and president florentino perez became at times, it does not sour his legend at the club.  neither does the 35-year-old's last year on the sidelines, even though this quiet farewell is not a fitting end to a blockbuster career in the spanish capital.  and while the legend tag is often overused, for ramos it may not even go far enough. the andalusian played for real madrid for 16 seasons, in a total of 671 games, scoring a remarkable 101 goals and lifting 22 trophies.  only paco gento (23) has more, winning those in the 1950s and 60s.  the six european cups he won cannot be compared to the four ramos has lifted, which were achieved under far greater competition in the modern era. since the european cup became the champions league in 1992, no side had managed to win it for two seasons in a row, until ramos captained madrid to three consecutive trophies, between 2016-2018. and yet, perhaps his greatest individual effort was in their 2014 triumph.   it was ramos' header in the 93rd minute that forced the champions league final with rivals atletico madrid into extra time, sparking real's comeback to win their desperately craved tenth european cup la decima.  madrid had waited over a decade for it, and ramos was the man who made it possible. that is why the numbers do not do him justice, as impressive as they are.  plainly, they show his value to madrid over the past 16 years, but they cannot tell the underlying story. the story of denying their neighbours the chance to lift the trophy for the first time.  the constant battles with barcelona, ramos' part in the clasico rivalry, the countless inspirational messages to supporters, bleeding white, not red, for the club. ""ramos is what i call a personality leader,"" former and current real madrid coach carlo ancelotti wrote in his book 'quiet leadership'.  ""a leader with strong character, who is never scared, never worried, and always positive. ""ramos' wild chaos, his visceral style of defending, will be missed.  that is what he brings as captain and what numbers cannot hope to tell though some will point to his career tally of 26 red cards to at least shine some light on his combative nature. he fought his way into the centre of defence after playing as right back in his early years at the club, but once he earned his place, he was impossible to shift. a fine defender and yet a better leader, ramos' story will not be told in clean sheets but in moments and in feeling, in panenka penalties and last-ditch sliding tackles.  in that goal against atletico but also the two headers in four minutes against bayern munich in the semi-final second leg in 2014, that took madrid to their first champions league final for 12 years. after that, it has been hard to keep them out of it.   there will be plenty of real madrid fans not old enough to remember the team without ramos in it, and several more who simply cannot, despite their age. it was september 2005 when ramos made his debut for madrid, as a substitute under coach wanderley luxemburgo, replacing francisco pavon in a 3-2 defeat by celta vigo at the bernabeu.  there were high hopes for him then, having arrived for â¬27 million from sevilla, but he has surpassed every expectation by a distance. it was in 2010 that he cemented his place in the heart of the defence, as pepe struggled with a knee problem.  half a decade later, and he had already cemented legend status, before the treble of champions league wins had even begun. that summer, ramos toyed with leaving, potentially joining manchester united, although he eventually used their interest to eke more money from madrid.  the mood turned against him in the capital, but only very briefly.  going to war with perez does not upset a fanbase who have often chanted for the president to resign. it is just as well for madrid he did not, playing a vital role alongside raphael varane under zinedine zidane.  ramos has played under 12 different coaches, 13 if you count zidane in his second spell as well. he played with the same aggression throughout his career, as mohamed salah bore witness to in the 2018 champions league final, with ramos' unorthodox challenge forcing the liverpool star from the pitch, smoothing madrid's path towards another trophy.   ""he is our captain, our leader.  we want him here forever,"" said zidane before christmas.  but the coach is gone, and now ramos follows. yes, purely as a defender, there have been a few better.  as for sheer talent, cristiano ronaldo is above him, alfredo di stefano too, as well as zidane.  but as a 21st century real madrid icon, there are none grander than their eternal captain. while ronaldo belongs not only to los blancos but also to manchester united, ramos is 110 per cent madrid's, despite his sevilla roots and no matter what the next chapter has in store.

2021-06-17,"Ant Inching Closer to IPO as Valuation Drops 60%, Bernstein Says.","ant group co.  could list its shares by the end of this year though the chinese fintech giant faces a 60% slash in valuation, according to a report from sanford c.  bernstein & co. the firm controlled by billionaire jack ma could be worth about $120 billion upon listing due to slower revenue growth, bernstein analysts led by kevin kwek wrote in a june 17 report.  ant may also have to inject 30 billion yuan ($4. 7 billion) to 40 billion yuan of capital into its new consumer finance unit to support credit growth, the analysts said. the revised estimate is a far cry from valuations that ran as high as $320 billion before the company was forced to scrap its record initial public offering in november.  china's crackdown forced ant to withdraw the $35 billion ipo just days before its planned listing in hong kong and shanghai.  bloomberg intelligence has lowered its valuation to a range of $29 billion to $115 billion. despite the hit in worth, the company is making progress overhauling its business and becoming compliant with regulatory requirements, bernstein said.  the company received approval to start its consumer finance unit, paving the way for the planned ipo. read more about ant's new consumer finance unitthe consumer finance unit could see its take rate -- revenue as percentage of average loan balance -- increase by 0. 5 percentage points to 3. 5% by 2025, as the company issues more credit using its own capital and generates more interest income, singapore-based kwek wrote. the consumer finance unit will need to provide 30% of funding for all co-loans, based on rules released earlier this year.  at 10 times leverage of its registered capital, that means its total amount of joint loans will be capped at 266 billion yuan, he said. ant's money market fund yu'ebao may also have to scale down, shrinking 25% to 1. 5 trillion yuan by 2025, curbing revenue growth, kwek said.

2021-06-17,"Singapore sees slowest population growth since 1965, Latest Singapore News.","singapore's population grew at its slowest pace since independence, with more singaporeans staying single and even those who marry having fewer babies. the nation's sixth census since independence in 1965 also found other key trends set in motion decades ago to have solidified further. singapore residents of all ages and races are now better educated and more do not consider themselves as having a religion. conducted once every 10 years, the census is the largest national survey undertaken here on key characteristics of the population such as demographic, social, economic and employment trends. more findings from the census of population 2020 will be released tomorrow. over the past 10 years, singapore's total population grew by around 1. 1 per cent each year the slowest rate since independence. the number of citizens grew from 3. 23 million to 3. 52 million, while the number of permanent residents held steady at around half a million. the population is ageing those aged 65 and older formed 15. 2 per cent of the resident population last year, a marked rise from 9 per cent in 2010. in a trend that has implications for continued population growth, the proportion of singles rose across all age groups over the past 10 years, with the sharpest increase among younger singaporeans aged 25 to 34. less-educated men were more likely to stay single, whereas the opposite was true of women. women, especially if they were more educated, had fewer children.  the average number of children born for every resident woman aged 40 to 49 who had ever been married fell from 2. 02 in 2010 to 1. 76 last year. within this age group, women who were university graduates had an average of 1. 66 children last year marking a steady decline from 1. 74 children 10 years ago and 1. 95 in 2000. singaporeans are also better educated.  among residents aged 25 and over, almost six in 10 (58. 3 per cent) attained post-secondary or higher qualifications, up from less than half (46. 5 per cent) in 2010.  the chinese, malay and indian communities all saw improvements. women closed the educational gap with men in each successive cohort. when it came to those aged 25 to 34, the proportion of women (90. 2 per cent) with post-secondary or higher qualifications exceeded men (90 per cent). english was the language most frequently spoken at home for 48. 3 per cent of residents aged five and over last year, up from 32. 3 per cent in 2010.  most of them also spoke a vernacular language at home. there are growing numbers of singaporeans who cite no religious affiliation. the proportion was 20 per cent last year, up 3 percentage points from a decade ago.  this number was 15 per cent in 2000.  the increase took place across all age groups and most types of educational qualifications. for more, read the straits timesget the new paper on your phone with the free tnp app.  download from the apple

huge spoilers ahead- episode 2 (of 6), 'the variant'
- written by elissa karasik
- directed by kate herron
âââââspoilers for the first two episodes of loki follow.  watch them first before reading this. superheroes may be the dominant force in popular culture right now, but their current screen success is a mere flash in the pan next to the longevity of the detective drama.  by merging the two genres in spectacular, wise-cracking fashion, however, loki episode 2 may have found one of the most potent forces in the universe. where last week's debut episode, 'glorious purpose', spent much of its runtime establishing the monochrome world of the time variance authority and how it fits into the marvel cinematic universe, 'the variant' plays out like a fully-fledged police procedural.  the idea of law-enforcement authorities hiring a criminal mastermind as an unlikely consultant has been used everywhere from hannibal to lucifer, and while it's a plot device that can occasionally slip into clichÃ©, it's an irresistible proposition when it works.  particularly when the two bickering leads work together as well as they do in the loki tv show. loki and mobius may come from different worlds, with totally opposing views on life, the universe and pretty much everything, but the mcu is a better place when they're together.  did you hear the one about the god of mischief and the tva agent? the answer is frequently hilarious and played to perfection, with tom hiddleston's shakespearean delivery finding its perfect foil in owen wilson's laidback texan drawl. crucially, you're never quite sure which of the duo has the upper hand.  anyone who can send a flamboyant god of mischief out into the world in a drab, standard-issue tva jacket with ""variant"" emblazoned across the back in big orange letters â ""very subtle. . .  well done,"" says loki â clearly wields a degree of control thor's brother has never encountered before.  indeed, mobius already knows exactly how to get under the asgardian's skin with his taunts about the fugitive loki variant being the superior model. and yet, every time you think mobius has clipped loki's wings, the god of mischief will push back with a clever delaying tactic, a spot of casual backstabbing (it's a speciality), or outright deceit â a drinking game inviting you to down a shot every time loki tells a lie would be downright danger to your health. while mobius often gives the impression he sees past loki's scheming, there are plenty of times his prisoner/partner gets the better of him.  the question is, who needs the other more? mobius's tease of a possible face-to-face meeting with the time-keepers (aka the ""three magic lizards"") has clearly piqued loki's interest â they're his best route back to his timeline, after all â but is the reward big enough to persuade loki to bury his face in a tva case file? is loki's less by-the-numbers approach to the mystery, an unconventional way of thinking that leads him to realize that the rogue variant is using apocalyptic events to hide from the time variance authority, the more valuable commodity? even mobius has to admit that loki is ""very clever"". there's also the growing sense that there's a grudging respect developing between the pair, and maybe even some common ground.  mobius's faith in the ""glorious purpose"" of the tva has remarkable parallels with loki's belief that residents of asgard are deities â though, as far as we're aware, loki is yet to express any interest in jet skis. the biggest reason this episode works so well, however, is that you could put loki and mobius in the most mundane of environments and they'd still be engaging company.  that this particular case takes them to assorted destinations in space and time â from ancient rome to 2050 alabama â only serves to make show more infectious. especially when the loki/mobius bickerfest isn't really the main event.  the entire episode is built around the hunt for the mysterious rogue loki, and the slow-build to a very big reveal is a masterclass in direction.  'the variant' makes no secret of the fact the hooded figure we saw at the end of 'glorious purpose' is the other loki, but has loads of fun with the tease.  from possessing hunter c-20 to take down an army of minutemen (soundtracked by bonnie tyler's 'holding out for a hero') to watching cctv screens in a giant future supermarket, loki 2. 0 is a constant, malevolent presence. and even when they step into the spotlight, they maintain a taste for the theatrical by taking over the bodies of hunter b-15 and other unfortunate souls, before spurning loki prime's offers of an alliance and revealing an unexpected female face.  ""this isn't about you,"" she tells male loki, as she unleashes an audacious plot to ""bomb the sacred timeline"" â it's a big enough deal to get ravonna renslayer out of her trinket-packed office. with two lokis now on the loose in the space-time continuum, all bets are off â chaos is, after all, what loki (or lokis) tend to do best.  head back in time with our recap of loki: episode 1. verdict: up there with the very best episodes of wandavision and the falcon and the winter soldier, 'the variant' is loads of fun from start to finish â a triumph of writing, acting and direction.  although the premiere episode suggested that loki may have been reformed when he learned his fate in the sacred timeline, he's back at his hilarious, double-crossing best here â particularly when he's sparring with the similarly brilliant agent mobius.  but the big news is the arrival of a female loki who â on the evidence of her brilliantly implemented evil scheme â may actually be the superior version of the trickster god, as mobius suggests. after an episode that does a brilliant impression of a cop show, the fact that two lokis are now on the run hints that â entirely appropriately for the character â the show may be about to shapeshift into something entirely different again.  the fugitive across the space-time continuum? sign us up. . . new episodes of loki debut on disney plus every wednesday. sign up to get breaking news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more, plus the hottest tech deals!thank you for signing up to techradar.  you will receive a verification email shortly. there was a problem.  please refresh the page and try again. techradar is part of future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.  visit our corporate site.

""the whole thing felt a shambles,"" said elaine (not her real name), a 35-year-old employment pass holder with a background in healthcare.  ""everyone in this new world is working as hard as they possibly can.  but they (personnel overseeing quarantine orders) need better leadership and better communication. ""after going for a family staycation at a hotel from 7-9 may with her husband and two children aged one and four, elaine was notified via text on 14 may of possible exposure to a covid case at the hotel pool.  the family and their helper were then issued a seven-day quarantine order by certis officers. over multiple calls with certis officers about whether the family home was suitable for quarantine and when their swab tests were taking place, the overall impression elaine had was of a ""disorganised"" effort.  ""the next day, someone turned up with a quarantine order and armbands (which we had to wear).  they installed these little black boxes, which work in tandem with the rfid in the armbands,"" recalled elaine.  ""we said we already had the home app, where you can log your temperature three times a day and it tracks your location.  it felt like we were criminals. ""elaine and her two children were eventually conveyed to a hospital for swab tests, but not her husband.  certis officers were ""unhelpful"" when she called the local security company and asked why.  ""when we called moh (ministry of health), they were much more helpful and sent a nurse around to do swab tests. ""she added, ""literally no one told us what would happen if we tested positive.  we were really worried that the kids might be taken away from us if they were positive. ""after multiple calls, elaine obtained negative results for herself and her boys, while the results for her husband and helper came two to three days later.  on 15 may, a day before the qo was to end, a nurse was sent to their home, after elaine had made multiple calls to moh to clarify her family's quarantine status, to conduct swab tests.  her one-year-old son was not tested for a second time as the nurse said it was not necessary.  ""they told us we would be fine as long as we didn't get a positive,"" said elaine, who was informed of her four-year-old son's negative test results on 17 may.  however, the next day, there was a knock at the door in the morning.  ""my helper was given a document by a certis officer, and she felt she had to sign it.  they didn't tell her what it was for.  it was an extension of my one-year-old boy's qo.  i called moh, and they couldn't give me any info,"" said elaine, who noted that the family had been to multiple places since the end of their quarantine.  her husband took their younger son to get tested, where he was told that the extension was likely due to the fact that the boy had not been tested when the family was let out of quarantine.  the boy was eventually cleared. ""the lack of communication is very frustrating.  it really impacts your anxiety levels,"" said elaine.  a 37-year-old lawyer who only wished to be known as ms wang also endured a ""frustrating and confusing"" experience after being issued a qo from 18-25 may, following her possible exposure to covid-19.  having confined herself to her room, the mother of two was informed that certis officers would assess her home for quarantine suitability but no one turned up.  at the end of the qo, having received a negative swab result on 21 may, she interacted with her family members. on 26 may, she received an sms telling her to go for a swab test and that she had been issued another qo from 20-29 may.  after numerous calls to the certis hotline, ms wang was told that her qo would be rescinded if she were to get a negative swab result. the following day, despite her healthhub app displaying a negative result, a certis officer came to issue her the new qo.  she was then told by two other officers over the phone that the negative result was invalid as her quarantine had been extended and she needed another swab.  after multiple calls, her qo was finally rescinded in the evening. ""you basically have to keep calling until you find someone helpful,"" said ms wang, who was in a ""state of anxiety"" for fear of possibly infecting her family members.  ""the communication is abysmal.  i understand that they need to do this, but they need to manage the process properly.  these are people's lives. ""alluding to prime minister lee hsien loong's remarks last month that the government will take a more aggressive approach to testing and quarantine, she added, ""the current process already seems overstretched.  i think it would be so easy to improve this just by being clear.  if you tell people what to expect, there won't be so much anxiety. ""as neither woman wanted to be identified, their detailed accounts and personal details could not be shared with the moh. yahoo news singapore asked moh about the volume and nature of complaints it has received regarding the serving and enforcement of qos during phase 2 (heightened alert), which lasted from 16 may to 13 june.  in light of pm lee's remarks on more aggressive testing and quarantine, the ministry was also asked if it is confident that it has sufficient resources to test and quarantine potentially thousands more. in response, an moh spokesperson said that extensive contact tracing, including leveraging on tracetogether and safeentry records, is a key strategy to cast a wide net to isolate and ring-fence any possible emerging transmissions in the community. the spokesperson noted that ""wider rings"" are being drawn around cases to combat the more transmissible strains, while more people are now using tracetogether and safeentry, which provides moh with more data for contact tracing and quarantine.  ""this has led to a higher number of persons under quarantine (puqs), resulting in delays in the testing and conveyance to quarantine facilities,"" said the ministry.  ""we seek the public's understanding and patience.  we will continue to improve our operating processes and improve communications between the various agencies involved in managing the quarantine process.

""i plan to use one kit to test myself before i go on my trip and the other two to occasionally check on myself as my grandparents live with me.  i don't want to risk spreading anything to them,"" said mr lim. he told st he will buy more kits if he is able to use them with ease. mr jordan lim, 30, director of red ginger, said that he intends to purchase 150 sets of the test kits for his employees across his four eateries islandwide. he said it gives them the convenience of administering the test once every two weeks without having to go to a test centre. but he is concerned about the ongoing cost of testing, saying: ""purchasing the test kits will only add on to our operational cost.  with the current pandemic, our revenue has significantly decreased so we're unsure if we can absorb the costs of the testing kits in the long run. ""the self-administered testing kits are meant to make testing fast, easy and accessible as singapore gradually resumes more activities. the self-administered tests will allow moh to detect infected cases more quickly, in particular among asymptomatic individuals and those concerned that they might have been exposed to covid-19. sales across all pharmacies are currently limited to 10 art kits per person to ensure there are adequate supplies for all. the guardian spokesman said its pharmacies have sufficient stock to cater to the expected demand. ""the limit of 10 kits has been set to ensure sufficient stocks for everyone. . .  our pharmacists will exercise discretion with regards to the sale of test kits and we will encourage customers to shop safely and purchase only what they need,"" she said.  ""we will continue to closely monitor the situation and adapt our measures where needed. ""

individuals who have a positive result for their art self-test should immediately approach a swab and send home public health preparedness clinic for a confirmatory polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test, moh said. they are then required to self-isolate until they receive a negative pcr test result. 
meanwhile, those who test negative on their self-test art should still stay vigilant and adhere to prevailing safe management measures. individuals who have acute respiratory infection symptoms have also been urged to visit a doctor for a full diagnosis and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test instead of relying on an art self-test kit. the hsa has also noted that arts have a lower sensitivity than pcr tests and a higher chance of false negative results.  in general, arts can achieve a sensitivity of about 80 per cent for cases with higher viral loads and a specificity range of 97 per cent to 100 per cent, it added. sensitivity refers to a test's ability to identify those infected as positive, while specificity refers to a test's ability to correctly identify those not infected as negative. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright Â© 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

""these are accusations we reject.  while the error was culturally insensitive, it was certainly not racist.  it is not right to raise the allegation of racism, without basis, to stoke emotions and sentiments,"" said the pa in monday's statement. it added that ms sarah had made a call online for the public to share their messages and suggestions to the pa.  it said that the meeting should not be ""appropriated as a platform for her to funnel the views and comments of persons unrelated to the incident"". ""all these lead us to believe her purpose in agreeing to meet with us has gone far beyond the radin mas incident.  we therefore see no point in proceeding with the meeting,"" pa said. sarah bagharib respondsin an instagram post on tuesday evening, ms sarah said that it was disappointing that pa had decided to cancel the meeting, which had been scheduled to take place earlier in the day at 10am. ""while there was an infringement of our privacy and intellectual property rights, our intentions have always been clear from the start to be active citizens and to positively contribute to making singapore a better, more inclusive home for our daughter,"" she said. ""we feel this is a missed opportunity for constructive dialogue; for thoughts and suggestions of members of the community to be relayed, and also for the people's association to listen to the people's voices.  it is unfortunate that the pa has turned this opportunity down. ""she added that the incident did not just affect her and her husband through the ""culturally insensitive"" depiction of hari raya celebrations, but also the ""wider community"" that celebrates hari raya. ""we will continue to advocate for deeper intercultural understanding and greater social cohesion in our everyday lives as singaporeans,"" ms sarah said. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

""it added that these sectors were more severely hit by the pandemic, compared with previous recessions. youth are defined as those aged 15 to 24. about four in 10 youth in employment are in temporary jobs or contract work, the report said.  they are mostly students who work on the side. unemployment rate among youth is also consistently higher than other age groups, reflecting the job search of fresh graduates entering the labour market, for instance, the report said. there is also a higher churn among this age group as they explore various options to find a suitable job.  those who are studying might also frequently move between temporary or part-time jobs. mom noted that youth unemployment is mostly transitional and short term. the youth long-term unemployment rate last year was still comparable to previous crises.  it stood at 1. 1 per cent in 2020, similar to the 1. 3 per cent recorded in 2003 and the 1 per cent in 2009. singapore's youth long-term unemployment rate is also one of the lowest when compared with other economies such as france, britain and hong kong, the report showed. the report also studied the proportion of young people who are not in employment, education or training.  this reflects the difficulty among youth in finding a job, and their likelihood of being idle economically. the prevalence of youth in such a situation rose to 5. 3 per cent last year, compared with 4. 5 per cent in 2019. but the report added that this figure remains low, relative to international counterparts. mom said: ""taken together with singapore's good international standing in terms of low unemployment and long-term unemployment rates, the favourable labour market outcomes of our youths attest to our quality education and training system.

2021-06-17,Football: Denmark sees surge in 'heart runners' after Eriksen's cardiac arrest.,"copenhagen: the cardiac arrest suffered by denmark midfielder christian eriksen during a euro 2020 match has seen a seven-fold increase in sign-ups for the ""heart runner"" app, which allows emergency services to quickly direct citizen responders to assist heart attack victims. eriksen's life was saved when cpr was administered to him on the pitch and his heart was re-started with a defibrillator before he was taken to hospital, where he is recovering. the incident shocked millions of tv viewers around the world and prompted hundreds of danes to sign up for the app as volunteers who will make themselves available in similar situations. ""this tragic incident has put in perspective what is really important, and that you and i can make a difference by performing cpr,"" fredrik folke, clinical professor at copenhagen university and head of research at the copenhagen emergency medical service, told reuters. ""in a normal weekend we would have around 90 to 100 new signups, but just after the match and until the next morning we had around 700 new signups. ""the app is part of a scheme backed by non-profit foundation trygfonden, and folke says almost all those signing up as volunteers have had formal cpr training. ""you sign up for the app and you register.  if there's a cardiac arrest, we can automatically alert the ten nearest citizen responders and they would receive the alert immediately,"" folke said. ""they will be instructed to either run directly to the cardiac arrest and do cpr, or directed to the nearest defibrillator in the vicinity, which they can use before the emergency services arrive. ""eriksen's collapse during the match against finland has prompted calls around the world for more cpr training and for defibrillators to be more available, not least at sports grounds and training facilities. doctors are still trying to establish the cause of eriksen's heart stoppage.  the inter milan player has posted a picture of himself on social media thanking fans for their support. according to statistics from trygfonden, the chances of surviving a heart attack increase from less than 10per cent to over 70per cent if the victim receives cpr and a shock from a defibrillator before the ambulance arrives. as shown at copenhagen's parken stadium on saturday, quick action is necessary.

2021-06-17,Inquiry into 'fake Covid tests' at India's Kumbh Mela.,"police in the northern indian state of uttarakhand have registered a case against three private labs for filing fake covid reports. media reports say fake names, mobile numbers and addresses were used in more than 100,000 tests during the kumbh festival in april. the private labs were hired by the state to screen visitors for covid. uttarakhand was criticised for holding the festival, which attracted millions of people, during the pandemic. reports from different states suggested that those who returned from the festival ended up infecting a large number of people. unmasked crowds thronged the kumbh festival in april even as several indian cities grappled with a severe shortage of oxygen and hospital beds. at the time, officials said that every visitor was being screened for covid.  private labs, based in haryana and delhi, were hired to conduct a majority of the tests. but media reports last week alleged that these labs faked covid reports to meet their daily testing quota. the same phone numbers and addresses were used in hundreds of covid reports.

2021-06-17,Japan condom-makers fear anticlimax at Olympics.,"tokyo: for japanese condom makers, the olympics was supposed to be a golden opportunity, with hordes of eager tourists and tens of thousands of their innovative, ultra-thin prophylactics given to athletes. but a ban on overseas fans, strict virus rules, and regulations preventing the distribution of their premium condoms to competitors have left manufacturers deflated. since the 1988 seoul games, hundreds of thousands of free condoms have been distributed at the olympics, to encourage safe sex as the world's elite athletes mingle at close quarters. while organisers are still expected to hand out 160,000 at the pandemic-postponed games, which start next month, covid-19 rules should limit interaction in the olympic village. the rulebook for athletes specifically warns them to ""avoid unnecessary forms of physical contact"", leaving some wondering why condoms are being distributed at all. the plan to give them out ""is something i just cannot comprehend"", tweeted ken noguchi, a japanese mountaineer and environmental activist. games organisers say distributing condoms is meant to raise awareness about hiv/aids, and that the international olympic committee has asked for the handouts to continue this year, despite the pandemic. ""the distributed condoms are not meant to be used at the olympic village,"" the organising committee told afp. instead they are supposed to be ""brought back by athletes to their respective home countries and to help them support the campaign to raise awareness"", they added. while the distribution is going ahead, there's a wrinkle for manufacturers: a ban on their prized model, condoms that are just 0. 01mm thick. hard timesas soon as tokyo was named 2020 host, japanese condom firms thrust ahead with their manufacturing to ensure maximum coverage in time for the games. now it turns out the manufacturers can only distribute their latex-based condoms, while the ultra-thin models are made of polyurethane, according to the japan condoms industrial association. ""when i learned about the requirement, i thought, 'oh my god . . .  can that be right?"" an industry source told afp. ""we had really counted on being able to offer these (ultra-thin) ones. ""it's a far cry from the heady excitement in the run-up to the games before they were postponed last year. in 2018, leading condom-maker sagami rubber industries opened a new factory in malaysia to meet the expected rise in demand. ""it's only japanese companies that now manufacture condoms as thin as 0. 01-0. 02mm,"" spokesman hiroshi yamashita told afp at the time. ""we see (the tokyo games) as an extremely precious opportunity to let the world know about japan's high technology. ""the pandemic has brought on hard times, with japan's borders effectively closed to tourists and olympic organisers barring overseas spectators for the first time in history. in tokyo's quirky harajuku and bustling shibuya neighbourhoods, the condomania boutiques managed by koji negishi usually attract large numbers of tourists. but ""foreign tourists have basically disappeared from this area, compared to 2019"", he told afp. negishi's shops stock a variety of products intended to appeal to visitors, ranging from the famed barely-there prophylactics to souvenirs printed with iconic ukiyoe woodblock prints, like the ""great wave"" with mount fuji in the background. ""the ones that are designed as souvenirs don't sell at all,"" negishi said mournfully. ""now our shop is staying afloat thanks to regular customers from the neighbourhood,"" he added. however, covid-19 restrictions in tokyo have also reduced the number of japanese customers. an industry source said domestic tastes appear to favour condoms with extra lubricant, rather than the ultra-thin style. ""from a safe sex perspective, what we want is people using any condom, rather than none,"" he said. ""so at the end of the day, whatever people choose because it feels good to them is a good thing to us. ""it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-17,"You had one job: Akamai's Prolexic Denial-of-Service protection system fingered after users in Australia denied, er, services â¢ The Register.","a wide range of internet-connected services in australia, including banking systems, are experiencing an outage â and it looks like a hiccup at akamai was at the heart of the problem. reports of issues with news sites, gaming services, and â more critically â banking systems began to spread on australian social media early thursday afternoon local time.  uptime-tracking service downdetector concurred, showing a massive spike in issues at commonwealth bank, westpac, bankwest, st. george bank, bank australia, bank of melbourne, and others. ""we're aware some of you are experiencing difficulties accessing our services and we're urgently investigating,"" commonwealth bank told customers.  ""we apologise and thanks for your patience, we'll provide an update soon. ""the root cause of the outage is still unknown but fingers soon began pointing to akamai technologies, a multinational cloud service company which provides â among other things â a system for defending against distributed denial-of-service (ddos) attacks. akamai told the reg this morning: ""we are aware of the issue and actively working to restore services as soon as possible. ""its defence system, dubbed prolexic, may be to blame: local aussie outlet itnews has posted a support chat session in which an akamai agent advised a customer to ""kindly turn off/route off [the] prolexic solution"" in order to resolve the issue. while fault tracking indicates that services are beginning to return to normal, users still appear to be experiencing difficulties connecting to banking systems.  ""i've been stuck at coles for two hours now,"" one bank user complained.  ""could i get a zinger stacker box coupon for the wait? cheers.

"" Â®neo4j has secured another $325m in a funding round and said it was ready to demo a distributed graph database with a trillion relationships, sharded across 1,000 servers, returning queries in a matter of milliseconds. new investors dtcp â formerly deutsche telekom capital partners â and lightrock join existing investors one peak partners, creandum, and greenbridge partners. the latest injection of funds â which is said to value neo4j at $2bn â adds to earlier rounds including $10. 6m in 2011, $11m in 2012, $20m in 2015, $36m in 2016, and $80m in 2018. a uk government taskforce chaired by the architect of the disastrous Â£700m ""one dole-to-rule-them-all"" universal credit it project, sir iain duncan smith mp, has published a wish list of regulatory proposals it wants to see adopted by a post-brexit administration. included are wholesale reforms of data laws, the development of a ""smart"" energy grid, new rules governing drones and e-scooters, digital health and the partial return of imperial measures. also sitting on the three-person taskforce were theresa villiers mp and george freeman mp. tim cook has claimed that proposed reforms to the app store are ""not in the best interests of the user"" and would ""destroy the security of the iphone.

""the name 'tau' also stands for the golden ratio,"" sachin gupta, vp and gm of compute at google cloud, told the register in an interview.  ""this is like the balance that you need in the design, with the latest cpu technology from our partner amd, in order to achieve the best outcome. ""we've taken the latest generation of the cpu and put it into a server that's optimised for performance, rather than for some of the other things and other flexibilities like we have for large-scale databases.  working with key customers like snap and twitter, we talked to understand what are the things that we should shift in the server design, in the machine itself, to optimise for this kind of scale-out architecture,"" gupta added. opayo, the payment processor formerly known as sage pay, has not been having a great thursday, as an unknown systems failure took its systems offline preventing customers from accepting any payments. the biz is no small beans: it provides payment processing for companies including europcar, krispy kreme, easyjet, bunches, office shoes, murco petroleum, and even provides the technology behind the bbc's children in need donation app. the trouble started in the early hours, with opayo's status reports on the glitch beginning at 04:20 utc.  initially, the issue appeared to be limited to the company's live payment gateway a bad part of the system to go down right before shops begin to open but it soon spread. a team of researchers have detailed a range of techniques which they suggest could one day lead to a genuine cloak of invisibility although, thanks to toyota's involvement, they're looking to start by making the windscreen pillars disappear from your next car. ""we are always looking for ways to keep drivers and passengers safe while driving,"" explained author debasish banerjee of the work, which was led by the toyota research institute of north america in partnership with south korea's inha university and the university of michigan.  ""we started exploring whether we could make the light go around the pillar so it appeared transparent. ""while the stanchions framing a car's windscreen provide a key aspect of its structural integrity, they're annoyingly located right where you would want to look in order to see other road users.  removing them would weaken the car, so toyota's looking into the next best thing: rendering them invisible. computer scientists have built prototype software capable of not only detecting fake images forged by neural networks but also estimating the properties of the model used to generate these so-called deepfakes. the project is a collaboration between academics at michigan state university (msu) in america and facebook ai research (fair), the aim being to make a tool that can tackle campaigns of coordinated disinformation and the like. typical machine-learning models trained to sniff out deepfakes work by predicting whether, say, a given image was electronically manipulated.  the msu-fair system, however, goes deeper, and can suggest the architecture of the neural network used to create the images, which could be useful for grouping together images and attributing them to a particular disinformation campaign.  in other words, you could take 100,000 images and, using the msu-fair code, determine 2,000 of them were created by someone with a model of type a, and 3,000 were created by another group using model type b, etc. looking for a design and coding tool for react? a new effort, utopia, was released in alpha this week. facebook-sponsored react is the most popular javascript framework for building user interfaces â the stackoverflow 2020 survey reported usage by 35. 9 per cent of developers, ahead of angular at 25. 1 per cent â and is also used by other projects such as react native, for desktop and mobile applications, and as the basis for other frameworks such as the next. js server-side rendering framework and the gatsby static site generator. the usual way to design with javascript and html/css is to write some code and then run it to see what it looks like.  there are also visual designers but it is hard to get the flexibility and control of pure code combined with the speed of a graphical design tool.  utopia, just released in alpha, claims ""full two-way synchronisation,"" meaning that the design and the code update each other instantly. a report into the office for product safety and standards (opss) has highlighted ""gaps in regulators' powers"", with major risks found in oversight of online marketplaces, ""smart"" internet of things devices â and, oddly, artificial intelligence. also worrying are brexit related regulatory issues such as an upcoming deadline for mandatory use of the uk conformity assessed mark, the ""equivalent"" replacement to the european ce mark, as well as difficulties monitoring goods coming into uk ports. the opss was founded in 2018.  its establishment followed an outcry over major national safety issues, not least the fatal fire in june 2017 at grenfell tower, when 71 people died in a 27-storey public housing block in the heart of the wealthy london suburb of north kensington. stob exterior: model shot.  the enterprise is seen parked above the equator of a planet.  as usual, it is at a peculiar, inward-shifting angle relative to its background.  it gives the impression that, far from being captured by gravitational pull, it can only sustain its orbit by continually

japan's government will include a pledge to achieve a ""safe and secure"" tokyo olympic games in its economic blueprint due out on friday, according to a final draft seen by reuters on wednesday. an earlier draft blueprint only called for making the olympics leave ""various legacies"" behind, while the final version appeared to stress the government's resolve to go ahead with the games. the final draft came days after prime minister yoshihide suga said he had won support at a g7 summit meeting in britain for holding the olympics despite public concern that the sports extravaganza could worsen the spread of coronavirus infections. ""we will realize the safe and secure games while creating various legacies,"" the draft said. the government will also clarify its resolve to complete its vaccination program by the end of november, according to the draft which is due to be approved by the cabinet on friday. it said the government would do the utmost to curb infections, while firmly backing businesses, jobs and people's livelihood by conducting flexible macroeconomic policy. ""we will ensure economic recovery by deploying all policy tools while tapping external demand, with the resolve never to push japan back into deflation,"" the draft read, citing green, digital, local regions and childcare as key areas of investment. it called for doubling outstanding foreign direct investment in japan to 80 trillion yen ($727. 80 billion) by 2030. ""we will strive to make the size of the economy 600 trillion yen and achieve the aim of fiscal reform. ""to achieve fiscal reform, the draft kept the government's pledge to achieve a primary budget surplus by fiscal year-end in march 2026 while reassessing the target by the end of this fiscal year taking into account coronavirus fallouts. 100% online and fully accredited, level 7 qualification for board directors.  over six months, develop the skills to become a confident and truly effective board memberprime minister yoshihide suga said he had won support at a g7 summit meeting in britain for holding the olympics despite public concern that the sports extravaganza could worsen the spread of coronavirus infections. well, if the g7 say so, it must be alright. in the old days 'bread and circuses' were a sop, now they're compulsory. . . .

"" -
yep, we believe you.  foreigners living here aren't as gullible as the locals, the joc doesn't get itoh, that's right, they shot it down;""the main opposition constitutional democratic party & three others submitted a no-confidence motion against pm suga's cabinet for not extending the regular session, 
. . . but it was voted down by members of the ruling ldp, komeito and other [allies].  and once again, quietly slithered into the shadows. ""after reading the small print, it was discovered that the precise wording read we will keep the members of the ioc safe and make certain that they secure their broadcasting money.  the plebs can do whatever they need to get by""well, they've already failed on that by allowing it to go on. any ""promise, pledge, effort, etc. . . ""made now or before were made null and void the instant the ioc leaders said this:barring armageddonthe olympics will happen. if armageddon is the level needed to stop the olympics then in reality any promises made with regard to safety are pure lip service. economic blueprint for something that starts next month. gosh, japan, your spontaneity is intoxicating!will there be also 'safe and secure' olympics mascot or ""cute character""? now that we have a blueprint, which is totaly necessary. .  the games haven't even started yet, but the whole extravaganza around it is consuming more and more money, and at an ever-increasing rate.  where the brazilians or the chinese wasted money building stadiums that were never used after olympics (or just few times), we waste horrendous ammounts of money on meetings, reports, blueprints, mascots and other nonsense. yeah, foreigners are so savvy.   what an arrogant remark.   as if the so-called locals are unawares. the only legacy, will be one of disaster and ignorance, the sense of ignoring the mandate of the people, who decried and opposed the olympics being held during a pandemic. who cares what the other leaders said they don't have to deal with the mess if everything goes south.   they probably won't even let their citizens get on the plane and go home unless they're in the clear first. anyone for tennis at the olympics ? no nadal, no federer, no williams, no osaka, djokovic unlikely.  baseball maybe ? no cuba, no taiwan, no australia.  us is a 4th rate team. in cycling, more and more cancellations, among them the reigning world champion. golfers, pulling out. no lebron in basketball.  but record medal harvest for japan more and more likely so success assured. use your facebook account to login or register with japantoday.  by doing so, you will also receive an email inviting you to receive our news alerts. 100% online and fully accredited, level 7 qualification for board directors.  over six months, develop the skills to become a confident and truly effective board membera mix of what's trending on our other sites

2021-06-17,Opinion.,"president biden's first summit meeting with vladimir putin was preceded by reports of persistent cyberattacks by russian state and private actors against sensitive u. s.  targets and a major russian military mobilization along the borders of ukraine, among other provocations.  mr.  biden consequently vowed to reestablish ""red lines"" with the kremlin ruler, who himself told an interviewer that relations were at their lowest point in years.  so it was somewhat surprising that both leaders emerged from their talks in geneva on wednesday describing a positive exchange and the potential for a more stable and cooperative relationship. ""the talks were quite constructive,"" said mr.  putin, who went on to praise mr.  biden as ""very balanced"" and ""very experienced. "" ""the tone of the entire meeting was very good, positive,"" agreed the u. s.  president.  ""i think there is a genuine prospect for us to significantly improve relations between our countries. ""it would certainly be welcome if mr.  biden's discussion with the russian ruler, and follow-up talks they agreed would take place, led to an end to russia-based cyberattacks, the relaxation of the kremlin's squeeze on the russian operations of radio free europe/radio liberty, and the release of u. s.  citizens unjustly imprisoned in moscow.  mr.  putin hinted ""compromise"" was possible on all these matters.  mr.  biden further reported that mr.  putin had offered ""help"" on iran and afghanistan, and that accommodations were possible on the wars in syria and libya, where the two countries back opposing sides. in short, the rhetoric sounded a lot like that which followed the initial encounters between the past three u. s.  presidents and mr.  putin, who has invariably reneged on his promises and relentlessly escalated his assaults on the u. s.  political system and alliances.  the russian ruler's implacable hostility toward the united states was evident in his performance at a post-summit news conference, in which he repeatedly offered bogus comparisons between his foreign aggressions, his human rights offenses, and u. s.  actions.  his persecution of the peaceful opposition movement led by alexei navalny, he claimed, was comparable to the prosecution of the mob that stormed the u. s.  capitol on jan.  6. mr.  biden called that comparison ""ridiculous,"" but otherwise appeared willing to offer mr.  putin the benefit of the doubt.  mr.  putin surely understood, the president asserted, that the death of mr.  navalny would be ""devastating for russia,"" because of the harm that would be done to the regime's global standing; the kremlin knew that the united states possessed significant cyber capabilities and would use them if russia's cyberattacks continued.  ""i think the last thing he wants now is a cold war,"" mr.  biden said of mr.  putin.  perhaps.  but why, then, is his regime engaged in such mischief-making as seeking to discredit u. s.  vaccines? who is responsible for the mysterious injuries suffered by u. s.  diplomats and intelligence officials in moscow, havana and even washington?mr.  biden properly devoted much of his european tour to reaffirming u. s.  ties to its major democratic allies after four years of disruption by president donald trump.  mr.  biden underlined his aspiration to lead them in a contest for global influence with resurgent autocracies, led by china and russia.  he was right to meet mr.  putin and seek to reestablish u. s.  red lines.  as for the prospect of ""significantly improved relations,"" mr.  biden said, ""we'll find out. ""indeed we will, but there's no reason to believe the outcome will vary from previous u. s.  attempts at cooperation with mr.  putin. read more:jennifer rubin: what biden knows about being a

2021-06-17,Football: Ramsey and Roberts give Wales 2-0 victory over Turkey.,"baku: captain gareth bale inspired a scintillating 2-0 victory for wales over turkey on wednesday (jun 16), giving the dragons a big leap towards the european championship knockout stages and reviving memories of their 2016 run to the semi-finals. midfielder aaron ramsey missed two early chances, but made no mistake just before halftime when he chested down bale's perfect ball over the defence to slot past the goalkeeper. wales could have doubled the lead at the hour mark when bale was tripped by zeki celik and awarded a penalty, but the welsh skipper skied his effort after a stuttering run up. wales were rewarded for their superiority throughout when they scored right at the death as a corner was played short and defender connor roberts was on hand to divert another bale pass past goalkeeper ugurcan cakir. ""we fought hard, we worked our socks off like we always do,"" bale said. the group a win thrilled the few hundred wales fans outnumbered by turkish supporters at baku's olympic stadium and many more at home who are dreaming of another euros run like their first appearance in the tournament five years ago. the surprise semi-finalists then, who next play italy, now have four points, after drawing with switzerland in their opener.  turkey, without points, take on the swiss next. remarkably, wales now have the best winning percentage in the euros' history: 63 per cent or five wins in eight games. wednesday's man-of-the-match bale twice picked out ramsey before his goal with superb defence-splitting passes.  cakÄ±r denied him from a tight angle in the sixth minute and then ramsey thundered a shot over the bar in the 24th. there was nothing lucky about the third time, though, with bale floating a superbly-timed cross in the 42nd minute for ramsey who brought the ball down perfectly to slot under cakir. turkey apologeticwith turkish and azeri presidents tayyip erdogan and ilham aliyev in the stands, turkey upped the pace after the break. captain burak yilmaz, who had missed a good chance in the first half, should have scored 10 minutes after the restart when he was unmarked in front of the welsh goal but blazed a volley from three metres out well over the crossbar. on the hour, bale was brought down just inside the box to earn a spot kick.  but the 31-year-old's effort flew high and wide to keep the turks in the game. ""it's unfortunate but what he did show was character afterwards,"" said wales manager rob page. ""everybody makes mistakes.  ok, he missed it, but so what? he got man of the match!""the disappointing turks did force a good save from keeper danny ward when he punched a merih demiral header wide in the 87th minute.  but they ran out of steam in stoppage time, allowing bale to cut inside to feed roberts for the second goal. ""i would like to apologise,"" turkey defender umut meras said.  ""we wanted to win so hard tonight but that was not enough. ""turkey coach senol gunes lamented his team could not level the game after going behind but had warm words for wales. ""we had many chances but couldn't find the equaliser.  wales played a good match.  they were effective with their pivot striker and two wingers,"" he said. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-17,Worldâs press condemns arrest of Apple Daily editor-in-chief.,"
                    thursday, 17 jun 2021
                ryan law, second from right, apple daily's chief editor, is arrested by police officers in hong kong thursday, june 17, 2021.  hong kong police on thursday morning arrested the chief editor and four other senior executives of apple daily under the national security law on suspicion of collusion with a foreign country to endanger national security, according to local media reports.  local media, including the south china morning post and apple daily, reported thursday that national security police arrested apple daily's chief editor ryan law.  (ap photo)the world association of newspapers and news publishers (wan-ifra), together with the world editors forum (wef), have condemned the arrest of apple daily editor-in-chief ryan law and four of its directors as hong kong's national security police continue to target the media company and its outspoken pro-democracy owner, jimmy lai. lai is currently serving a 20-month jail term for alleged foreign collusion and involvement in mass protests that swept hong kong in 2019. along with law, apple daily announced that chief executive officer cheung kim-hung, chief operating officer chow tat-kuen, deputy chief editor chan puiman, and chief executive editor cheung chi-wai had been arrested at their homes at around 7am thursday, 17th june. under the pretext of having violated the controversial national security law, hundreds of police officers took coordinated action against the five senior executives. the national security department said they had been arrested ""based on suspicion of collusion with a foreign country, or with external elements to endanger national security,"" via some 30 unspecified articles dating from 2019 which police said called â amongst other things â for sanctions to be imposed on hong kong and mainland china. the hong kong authorities have consistently stated the sweeping powers contained in the national security law, enacted in june 2020, would not be used retroactively. according to media reports, hong kong security chief, john lee, also accused those arrested of engaging in criminal behaviour and using ""journalistic work as a tool to endanger national security. "" he issued an explicit warning that sent a chilling effect throughout the hong kong media: ""normal journalists are different from these people. . .  please keep a distance from them. ""the pro-democracy tabloid has been a consistent target of recent efforts to clamp down on a free press since the implementation of the deeply unpopular national security law.  today's newsroom raid is the publication's second in a year, and with the issuing of an unprecedented warrant allowing the seizure of journalistic materials, it marks a significant escalation of the government's attempts to control media and the public discourse. police also froze hk$18mil (us$2. 3mil/rm9. 52mil) in assets of apple daily limited, apple daily printing limited and ad internet limited.  parent company, next digital, announced the suspension of trading in its shares before markets opened on thursday. wan-ifra and wef call for the immediate release of the apple daily staff and the unfreezing of the company's assets.  furthermore, it calls on the hong kong authorities to recognise that journalism is not a crime and that journalists should not be criminalised simply for doing their jobs. ""the national security law is being deliberately misused to suppress critical opinion and target those who dissent,"" said wan-ifra's executive director for press freedom, andrew heslop. ""any pretence that china would honour the governance agreement guaranteeing hong kong's special status, particularly in relation to the protection of basic human rights, has well and truly disappeared.  instead, the authorities are spreading fear and censuring media exercising their right to press freedom.  china's attempts to impose authoritarian rule over hong kong's media cannot and will not go unopposed.

2021-06-17,"Crowdfunding campaign launched for legal fees in labour dispute against SBS Transit; goal set for S$90,000.","as permission was granted on 10 june for the lawsuit by bus drivers against sbs transit to be heard in the high court, the group of 13 drivers has recently started a crowdfunding campaign to help cover legal fees for the case which has been represented on a pro-bono basis thus far. one of the drivers, chua qwong meng, started the campaign on behalf of the 13 drivers on gogetfunding, with a target of s$90,000. ""we are trying to raise $90,000 to help with the high court trial which might head up to the court of appeal,"" said mr chua on the campaign site, adding that ""there is too much at stake to stop here now"". he explained that several of the drivers' employment contracts had been terminated since the covid-19 outbreak in singapore became more severe.  this made it difficult for the group to keep up with the instalments of legal fees to their lawyer, m ravi. fortunately, mr ravi stayed on as their lawyer on a pro-bono basis. in a facebook post on 10 june, mr ravi explained the same thing, expressing that it has not been easy for him and his team. he explained his decision to act for the drivers on a pro-bono basis as they were ""not able to keep up with their installment payments"" for the ""small fee"" he had charged them.  this is on top of the other pro-bono cases he and his team have already taken on. on gogetfunding, mr chua wrote: ""after careful thinking, discussing with the other bus drivers and with the support of my family and friends, we have decided to crowdfund to help us with the continuance of this case in the high court and even further to the court of appeal if needed. ""stressing the importance of seeing the case through for the rights of all workers in singapore, he added: ""we cannot expect our lawyer and his team at k.  k.  cheng law llc to continue bearing all the costs of this suit especially with regard to the numerous extraneous filing and disbursement fees. ""whilst we are certain that mr ravi will give us highly discounted fees for the trial, we want to thank him, and his team at k.  k.  cheng law llc but we cannot expect them to continue this journey with us not being paid. ""we the 13 drivers are fighting for fairness so we must also be fair to our legal team too. ""mr chua went on to emphasise the group's belief that this case presents an opportunity for a review of the employment act to ensure that it protects all workers and is fair. ""this suit will not just be about myself but also about the other 12 bus drivers' suits which is pending the outcome of my suit,"" he remarked, adding that it will also affect other workers. the other 12 drivers involved in the case are mr lee chye chong, mr chian poh seng, mr fung chean seng, mr tan ting hock robin, mr thiyagu balan, mr gan kim kiam, mr huzainal hussein, mr lim you onn, mr chiew yi yee, mr meerah mohamed halideen, mr razak hasim, and mr mohamad sani din. on 11 march, mr ravi revealed that he had filed an application for the suits to be transferred from the magistrate court to the high court ""as there are several important questions of law of public interest relating to provisions in the employment act which will affect their cases and potentially all 6000 sbs drivers"". he stated that the suits will be a test for the rights of all employees in singapore. after hearing from both sides â sbs transit is represented by team of lawyers led by senior counsel davinder singh â justice audrey lim found that the certain questions of law raised in the suits affect not only the 13 sbs transit bus drivers, but also ""a larger class of employees including those in the public transport sector who may potentially fall within the definition of employees"" under part iii of the criminal law (temporary provisions) act (cla). justice lim also addressed mr chua's action of urging his case to be made a 'test case'.  while the state courts act (sca) does not provide a definition of a 'test case', the judge noted that both sbs transit and the drivers accept the definitions in black's law dictionary, which state that a 'test case' is:1.  a lawsuit brought to establish an important legal principle or right.  such an action is frequently brought by the parties' mutual consent on agreed facts â when that is so, a test case is also sometimes termed amicable action or amicable suit; or2.  an action selected from several suits that are based on the same facts and evidence, raise the same question of law, and have a common plaintiff or a common defendant.  sometimes, when all parties agree, the court orders a consolidation and all parties are bound by the decision in the test case.  â also termed test action. in the present case, the action brought by the sbs transit drivers to transfer the suit falls within the definition of a ""test case"", as it fits the second definition stated above, said justice lim. she also rejected sbs transit's submission that a test case should, on top of the second definition above, include case management ""or other concerns which would make the matter unsuitable for determination by the state courts"". on 3 mar last year, five bus drivers argued that by failing to compensate its bus drivers at the basic hourly rate of pay for their waiting time between shifts, sbs transit had breached an implied term stated in their service agreement. the lawsuit arose after the two parties had failed to reach a settlement in their final mediation session between the first tranche of suits as reported in feb last year. in a statement of claim filed in the state courts that month, the bus drivers alleged that the company has breached several provisions under the ea â the statutory legislation upon which the terms and conditions pertaining to their working hours and overtime were based on. the bus drivers claimed that sbs transit had failed to compensate them at the basic hourly rate of pay ""for the period between 4 a. m.  to 5 a. m.  on the morning and split shifts"" in which the drivers are ""engaged to be waiting"", and ""between 9 a. m.  and 1 p. m.  on the split shift"". sbs transit, they added, had also failed to abide by clause 24(9) of the service agreement by not compensating them the agreed allowance of $18 for work done on the night shift. the company, they alleged, had also breached section 36(1) of the ea by failing to provide on a roster a weekly rest day. in addition, the company had violated section 37(3)(b) and section 37(3)(c) of the ea by not paying them ""the statutorily prescribed rate"" of a sum at the basic rate of pay for two days' worth of work, the bus drivers argued. by imposing a ""built-in overtime"" that resulted in the bus drivers working for longer than the statutorily prescribed daily work period of eight hours as well as 44 hours per week, sbs transit had also breached section 38(1) of the ea, according to the bus drivers. other breaches under the ea allegedly made by sbs transit, as claimed by the bus drivers, include compensating them at the normal hourly rate of pay â instead of the statutorily prescribed rate of an extra day's salary at the basic rate of pay for one day's work, in addition to the gross rate of pay for that day â for work done on public holidays. the five additional bus drivers bring the total number of bus drivers currently taking legal action against sbs transit to 13.

lawsuit by bus drivers against sbs transit to be heard in the high court, the group of 13 drivers has recently started a crowdfunding campaign to help cover legal fees for the case which has been represented on a pro-bono basis thus far.', 'one of the drivers, chua qwong meng, started the campaign on behalf of the 13 drivers on gogetfunding, with a target of s$90,000.', '""we are trying to raise $90,000 to help with the high court trial which might head up to the court of appeal,"" said mr chua on the campaign site, adding that ""there is too much at stake to stop here now"".', ""he explained that several of the drivers' employment contracts had been terminated since the covid-19 outbreak in singapore became more severe."", 'this made it difficult for the group to keep up with the instalments of legal fees to their lawyer, m ravi.', 'fortunately, mr ravi stayed on as their lawyer on a pro-bono basis.', 'in a facebook post on 10 june, mr ravi explained the same thing, expressing that it has not been easy for him and his team.', 'he explained his decision to act for the drivers on a pro-bono basis as they were ""not able to keep up with their installment payments"" for the ""small fee"" he had charged them.', 'this is on top of the other pro-bono cases he and his team have already taken on.', 'on gogetfunding, mr chua wrote: ""after careful thinking, discussing with the other bus drivers and with the support of my family and friends, we have decided to crowdfund to help us with the continuance of this case in the high court and even further to the court of appeal if needed.', '""stressing the importance of seeing the case through for the rights of all workers in singapore, he added: ""we cannot expect our lawyer and his team at k.  k.  cheng law llc to continue bearing all the costs of this suit especially with regard to the numerous extraneous filing and disbursement fees.', '""whilst we are certain that mr ravi will give us highly discounted fees for the trial, we want to thank him, and his team at k.  k.  cheng law llc but we cannot expect them to continue this journey with us not being paid.', '""we the 13 drivers are fighting for fairness so we must also be fair to our legal team too.', '""mr chua went on to emphasise the group\'s belief that this case presents an opportunity for a review of the employment act to ensure that it protects all workers and is fair.', '""this suit will not just be about myself but also about the other 12 bus drivers\' suits which is pending the outcome of my suit,"" he remarked, adding that it will also affect other workers.', 'the other 12 drivers involved in the case are mr lee chye chong, mr chian poh seng, mr fung chean seng, mr tan ting hock robin, mr thiyagu balan, mr gan kim kiam, mr huzainal hussein, mr lim you onn, mr chiew yi yee, mr meerah mohamed halideen, mr razak hasim, and mr mohamad sani din.', 'on 11 march, mr ravi revealed that he had filed an application for the suits to be transferred from the magistrate court to the high court ""as there are several important questions of law of public interest relating to provisions in the employment act which will affect their cases and potentially all 6000 sbs drivers"".', 'he stated that the suits will be a test for the rights of all employees in singapore.', 'after hearing from both sides â sbs transit is represented by team of lawyers led by senior counsel davinder singh â justice audrey lim found that the certain questions of law raised in the suits affect not only the 13 sbs transit bus drivers, but also ""a larger class of employees including those in the public transport sector who may potentially fall within the definition of employees"" under part iii of the criminal law (temporary provisions) act (cla).', ""justice lim also addressed mr chua's action of urging his case to be made a 'test case'."", ""while the state courts act (sca) does not provide a definition of a 'test case', the judge noted that both sbs transit and the drivers accept the definitions in black's law dictionary, which state that a 'test case' is:1.  a lawsuit brought to establish an important legal principle or right."", ""such an action is frequently brought by the parties' mutual consent on agreed facts â when that is so, a test case is also sometimes termed amicable action or amicable suit; or2."", 'an action selected from several suits that are based on the same facts and evidence, raise the same question of law, and have a common plaintiff or a common defendant.', 'sometimes, when all parties

drivers to transfer the suit falls within the definition of a ""test case"", as it fits the second definition stated above, said justice lim.', 'she also rejected sbs transit\'s submission that a test case should, on top of the second definition above, include case management ""or other concerns which would make the matter unsuitable for determination by the state courts"".', 'on 3 mar last year, five bus drivers argued that by failing to compensate its bus drivers at the basic hourly rate of pay for their waiting time between shifts, sbs transit had breached an implied term stated in their service agreement.', 'the lawsuit arose after the two parties had failed to reach a settlement in their final mediation session between the first tranche of suits as reported in feb last year.', 'in a statement of claim filed in the state courts that month, the bus drivers alleged that the company has breached several provisions under the ea â the statutory legislation upon which the terms and conditions pertaining to their working hours and overtime were based on.', 'the bus drivers claimed that sbs transit had failed to compensate them at the basic hourly rate of pay ""for the period between 4 a. m.  to 5 a. m.  on the morning and split shifts"" in which the drivers are ""engaged to be waiting"", and ""between 9 a. m.  and 1 p. m.  on the split shift"".', 'sbs transit, they added, had also failed to abide by clause 24(9) of the service agreement by not compensating them the agreed allowance of $18 for work done on the night shift.', 'the company, they alleged, had also breached section 36(1) of the ea by failing to provide on a roster a weekly rest day.', 'in addition, the company had violated section 37(3)(b) and section 37(3)(c) of the ea by not paying them ""the statutorily prescribed rate"" of a sum at the basic rate of pay for two days\' worth of work, the bus drivers argued.', 'by imposing a ""built-in overtime"" that resulted in the bus drivers working for longer than the statutorily prescribed daily work period of eight hours as well as 44 hours per week, sbs transit had also breached section 38(1) of the ea, according to the bus drivers.', ""other breaches under the ea allegedly made by sbs transit, as claimed by the bus drivers, include compensating them at the normal hourly rate of pay â instead of the statutorily prescribed rate of an extra day's salary at the basic rate of pay for one day's work, in addition to the gross rate of pay for that day â for work done on public holidays."", 'the five additional bus drivers bring the

2021-06-17,"PA's follow-up statement on Tiong Bahru Hari Raya standee incident an instance of ""classic gaslighting"" of minorities' legitimate concerns on racism, netizens say.","source: sarah bagharib @sarahbagharib / instagramthe saga between the people's association (pa)'s and communications specialist sarah bagharib continues as the organisation's follow-up statement rouses the anger of many members of the public online. pa had used ms sarah's wedding photograph as a prop in its hari raya aidilfitri display at an hdb estate in tiong bahru.  while the standee was subsequently removed and the pa offered her a public apology, the organisation later said it rejects ms sarah's ""accusations"" of racism, branding the incident ""culturally insensitive"" and an ""isolated case"". posting on facebook on monday (14 june), pa referenced her interview with nanyang technological university professor walid jumblatt abdullah, from which she was quoted as saying that the incident has perpetuated a culture of racism. ""it is not right to raise the allegation of racism, without basis, to stoke emotions and sentiments,"" said pa. the organisation claimed that it had explained to ms sarah that while it acknowledges that its staff ""should have been more culturally sensitive"", it is not right to paint ""sweeping conclusions from this incident"". doubling down on its point that ms sarah's case was an isolated one, pa said that it finds ms sarah's public call for messages or suggestions that they would like to have relayed to the organisation in their meeting an ""odd"" one. ""we do not see why our meeting should be appropriated as a platform for her to funnel the views and comments of persons unrelated to the incident,"" said pa, adding that it is of the view that ms sarah's purpose in agreeing to meet its representatives ""has gone far beyond the radin mas incident"". pa said that it will not be following through with the meeting as there is ""no point"" in doing so, in light of the above. ""we agree it is important for our staff and volunteers to be sensitive to and knowledgeable about the cultures of all our ethnic groups.  we are now looking at establishing a resource panel to guide and advise our staff on cultural matters.  we will also step up training efforts to enhance staff and volunteers' understanding and appreciation of our different cultures,"" it added. pa also claimed that ms sarah's 1 june email had falsely alleged that it was ""hasty in sharing the name of the vendor"" in order to ""distance and deflect blame"" from itself. ""the vendor had identified himself directly to ms sarah on 28 may, and apologised.  this was before pa issued our statement on 29 may,"" it said. ""it is regrettable that ms sarah did not clarify this point during her instagram live interview with mr walid j.  abdullah on 7 june.  instead she persisted in conveying the impression that pa had deflected blame from itself,"" pa added. commenting on pa's facebook post, netizens expressed their shock and anger toward pa's ""gaslighting"" statements in its second public ""apology"". ""not only are you not aware of your mistake (yes, it's racist), you've completely downplayed and dismissed her outrage,"" one commenter said. several commenters pointed out how racism does not require intent, and that in the case of pa as a community organisation that receives funding from the government, such ignorance toward important markers of a minority race's culture ""points to institutionalised racism"" to some extent. ""it is racist because the standee incident is you disregarding the nuances of their culture for the sake of decoration and marketing,"" one commenter said. ""this is an example of racial discrimination, especially when the same thing never happens to chinese people in singapore in pa-related events,"" another said. others questioned pa's attempt to draw a distinction between the cultural insensitivity it purports to have perpetuated and the racism it claims to not have engaged in, saying that the two are not necessarily mutually exclusive.  challenging pa's view that its error was a one-off incident born out of cultural insensitivity alone, dÃ©sirÃ©e lim, who teaches philosophy at penn state university, commented: ""persistent and wilful ignorance of this nature is not the same thing as an innocent factual error.  it is about negligence and not-caring â the implicit judgment that a group is not deserving of proper understanding and accurate portrayal, because it does not merit such efforts from the dominant race. """"what the pa sought here was to give the superficial impression that they were on board with the celebration,"" she added. ""the pa could have hired willing malay-muslims to pose for festive photographs; instead, they thought that any malay couple would do.  would the chinese members of the pa who wrote this excuse of a response like it if their family photos were stolen without their consent and used for a completely different context â perhaps placed on an advertisement for a chinese restaurant in new york?"" assistant professor lim said.  several commenters said that racism goes beyond overt acts of violence and could entail cultural insensitivity such as the kind demonstrated by pa in the case at hand. ""go to australia or the usa hopefully u can come back being a humble being knowing what it feels to be a minority,"" one said. another said: ""listen to minorities.  they are the ones that have to deal with all the racism thrown at their faces. ""many commenters, including renowned playwright alfian sa'at, questioned pa's motives behind cancelling the meeting with ms sarah. they pointed out that the meeting could have been a precious opportunity to foster pa's understanding of the lived experiences of racial minorities in singapore with regard to racism. ""why are you making it seem as if the meeting you have set up with her is a precious privilege you have extended, to be withdrawn if somehow ms sarah fails to abide by your terms?"" mr alfian questioned. a couple of commenters highlighted the absurdity of a government institution rejecting dialogue with a person from a minority community in the wake of multiple racist incidents reported in the media, which they view as a form of slamming the door in the faces of minorities and shutting out their genuine concerns regarding their safety and wellbeing. many individuals of the chinese majority race also aired their discontent with pa's response, explicitly branding the organisation's error with the standee and its subsequent responses as racist and narrow minded.   several commenters said that while the standee incident itself did not necessarily tar its work as a community organisation, the defensiveness it displayed in its latest post had served to do so. the pa's deflection of blame to ms sarah in its follow-up post this time appears to be a form of ""bullying"" by a public institution against one individual, which many have said is particularly ironic for an organisation aimed at taking into account the people's views and seeing minorities as significant, equal stakeholders in its goals. several commenters also compared the pa's follow-up statement to that issued by the ministry of manpower in former dj jade rasif's case after a week-long dispute over ms jade's migrant domestic worker's quarantine order. several commenters took a jibe at the pa's public relations and communications team, wondering how the follow-up post was approved. they also questioned why the people behind the handling of ms sarah's case remain unnamed in pa's public statements thus far.  one commenter said that the pa should organise concrete initiatives to ""rectify their mistakes and to improve their cultural sensitivities by conducting free classes to other races on malay and indian (plus other minorities) festivals, religious norms and cultural sensitivities"". however, another commenter wondered how mistakes such as that in ms sarah's case could surface despite grassroots organisations representing the interests of the malay community regularly reaching out to community partners across races and religions.

2021-06-17,"If the Peoples' Association can't really represent all people, is it obsolete?.","ever since ms sarah bagharib called the peoples' association (pa) out for using her wedding photographs without her permission in its hari raya aidilfitri display at an hdb estate in tiong bahru, it has generated a firestorm of debate.  this alongside a number of disturbing videos that have surfaced, depicting blatantly racist behaviour has led a number of politicians from both the peoples' action party (pap) front and the opposition fronts to opine. perhaps bowing to public pressure, the pa has issued an apology of sorts to ms sarah.  i say ""an apology of sorts"" because while the word ""apologise"" has been used, it is an apology that is loaded with caveats and reservations. i accept that neither the pa nor the third-party vendor may have been intentionally racist â this begs the question: can something be racist without a racist intent?this is a nuanced question without a simple answer.  it is however important to acknowledge that when managing people's emotions and feelings, there is never a simple answer and we must not let our desire to be efficient cloud our empathy. first things first, i think it is probably fair to say that singapore is systemically set up to cater for the majority chinese race.  from advertisements on tv to speaking only chinese in certain restaurants, the subtext is that the minorities must adapt.  one might say this makes logical sense but i would urge you to pause there.  many of our minority fellow citizens are not new immigrants.  they like us (the majority race) were born and bred here, the descendants of immigrants.  for some of our malay brothers and sisters, they have been geographically here way before we were!secondly, while all of these policies that have placed efficiency above all else may not have had a racist intention, it nevertheless could result in racism.   let me give you an example. on every administration form ranging from local job applications to joining a gym, they ask what race you are.  when the practice started, it may have just been a question of simple efficiency.  listing your race upfront makes it easy to gather data etc.  but the shadow of this approach is that it gives an opportunity for those who may harbour racist intentions to exclude races they do not like.  so, this is an example of non-racist intentions giving birth to racist effects. by simply focussing on intent, we are missing the forest for the trees.  this isn't a blame game â it is about the acknowledgement that some practices have had racist effects (regardless of intent) and we must do better because the damage is real!the pa has bristled at accusations that it could be racist, preferring to hide behind the term ""culturally insensitive"".  but calling a spade a spade, isn't cultural insensitivity a part of racism, albeit on a lower scale?""these are accusations we reject.  while the error was culturally insensitive, it was certainly not racist.  it is not right to raise the allegation of racism, without basis, to stoke emotions and sentiments"". from the pa's perspective, they are part of a structure that is very much dominated and run in a way that caters systematically to the benefit of the majority chinese race.  while they run events that ostensibly celebrate minority culture, it seems to be done more as a box-ticking exercise.  in other words, it is done on autopilot without much thought. this is the crux of the issue with the usage of ms sarah's photographs.  it was lazy because the pa has fallen into the trap of stereotyping and generalising minorities.  hari raya equals malay.  malay costume equals hari raya.  it may not be intentional racism, but it still has racist effects.  this is especially so if the lived experience of the minorities in singapore is one where this sorts of casual and careless racism plague their daily existence. so, is it really right for the pa to dismiss this as an ""isolated incident""? is it also not itself making an accusation that ms sarah is stoking sentiments when it does not want to be accused of being racist? pot calling kettle black!this is the terminology that can have a gaslighting effect.  many have also dismissed the video of mr dave parkash being chastised by a senior lecturer from ngee ann polytechnic as an ""isolated incident"".  but is it really? people all over social media have shared their own experiences of being minorities in singapore and it is clearly not ""an isolated incident"".  is highlighting incidences of racism, however inadvertently ""stoking emotions or sentiments""? is the pa saying that minorities should just suck it up?while the pa may not have made this exact mistake before, can it categorically say that it has not been guilty of racial stereotype and other incidences of racist effects without intent?for the pa to call it simply an ""oversight"" is just not good enough.  it isn't an oversight.  it is a lack of regard and that is what they should be apologising for.  it is fine to state that it had not intended to be racist but despite that, the lack of care did result in a racist outcome.  apologise for the outcome and pledge to do better.  end of story. the pa has claimed that it finds ms sarah's public call for messages or suggestions that they would like to have relayed to the organisation in their meeting an ""odd"" one. i appreciate the pa's point of view if it misguidedly views this as an ""isolated incident"".  but you see, if you truly listen to the lived experience of minorities, this is not at all an isolated incident.  minorities do not often have a platform because we don't allow them one.  every time something is raised, we silence them with the hammer of ""this is an isolated incident"".  is it really that surprising that ms sarah is trying to give voice to the many minorities who have not been given a voice?yes it ""has gone far beyond the radin mas incident"" but it needs to and the pa is a good start.  after all, isn't it called the peoples' association? if it cannot represent the people, then maybe it is obsolete. let's not miss a golden opportunity to have a much-needed discussion. to simply issue a surface apology without deep reflection hoping that the matter will die down is just not good enough because this issue isn't just about the use of photographs without permission.  it is a reflection of our society's ignorance.  if we accept the pa's apology as it stands, we are saying that it is ok for the majority race to remain ignorant.

2021-06-17,Xi Jinping Picks Top Lieutenant to Lead Chinaâs Chip Battle Against U.S.,"(bloomberg) -- chinese president xi jinping is renewing his years-long push to achieve technology self-sufficiency by tapping a top deputy to shepherd a key initiative aimed at helping domestic chipmakers overcome u. s.  sanctions. liu he, xi's economic czar whose sprawling portfolio spans trade to finance and technology, has been tapped to spearhead the development of so-called third-generation chip development and capabilities and is leading the formulation of a series of financial and policy supports for the technology, according to people with knowledge of the matter. it's a nascent field that relies on newer materials and gear beyond traditional silicon and is currently an arena where no company or nation yet dominates, offering beijing one of its best chances to sidestep the hurdles slapped on its chipmaking industry by the u. s.  and its allies.  the sanctions, which emerged during donald trump's presidency, have already smothered huawei technologies co. 's smartphone business and will impede longer-term efforts by chipmakers from huawei's hisilicon to semiconductor manufacturing international corp.  to migrate toward more advanced wafer fabrication technologies, threatening china's technological ambitions. ""china is the world's largest user of chips, so supply chain security is of high priority,"" said gu wenjun, chief analyst at research firm icwise.  ""it's not possible for any country to control the entire supply chain, but a country's effort is definitely stronger than a single company. ""the involvement of one of xi's most-trusted lieutenants in china's chip efforts highlights the importance accorded by beijing to the initiative, which is gaining urgency as rivals from the u. s.  to japan and south korea scramble to shore up their own industries.  the chinese president has long called upon his harvard-educated adviser to tackle matters of top national priority, making him the chief representative in trade negotiations with the u. s.  as well as chairman of the financial stability and development committee, where liu leads the charge to curb risks in the nation's $5-trillion-plus financial sector. in may, liu spearheaded a meeting of the technology task force that discussed ways to grow next-generation semiconductor technologies, according to a government statement.  the 69-year-old vice premier, who has led the country's technology reform task force since 2018, is also overseeing projects that could lead to breakthroughs in traditional chipmaking, including the development of china's own chip design software and extreme ultraviolet lithography machines, one of the people said, asking not to be identified as they weren't authorized to speak to media. the state council and the ministry of industry and information technology didn't respond to faxed requests for comment. during trade negotiations with the trump administration, liu emerged as one of the most visible advocates of beijing's agenda.  he's known xi since childhood -- both are sons of veteran communist party leaders and were among masses of young people dispatched to work in impoverished rural areas during the cultural revolution.  now, liu is leading the charge to reform the tech sector, which was identified in china's latest five-year economic plan as a key strategic area in which the ""whole nation system"" should be used to mobilize any necessary resources. first introduced under mao zedong to help the then-fledgling communist china industrialize, the approach was crucial to helping beijing attain a number of top national priorities, from developing its first atomic bomb in the early 1960s to achieving olympic sporting success.  after that it was largely set aside as officials shifted to focus on economic growth.  but following a series of u. s.  sanctions that exposed the vulnerabilities of china's chip capabilities, xi is once again reactivating the mechanism to achieve breakthroughs in advanced chip development and manufacturing. about a trillion dollars of government funding have been set aside under the technology initiative, part of which will be used by central and local governments to jointly invest in a series of third-generation chip projects, according to people with knowledge of the matter.  top chipmakers and research institutes have submitted proposals to the ministries of science and information technology, all vying for a place in the national program and a share of the financing.  the ministry of science and technology is slated to inject 400 million yuan ($62 million) into some key ""strategic electronics materials"" including third-generation chips, according to a government document. even moonshot chip programs are in line for government funding.  the state-backed national natural science foundation of china has pledged financial support for dozens of exploratory research programs, ranging from ultra-low power consumption to the development of a flexible chip that can collect and transmit nerve signals, as beijing seeks to overcome ""computing bottlenecks"" when moore's law -- the industry standard for predicting the pace of chip improvements -- finally stops working. several subsidiaries of china electronics technology group corp.  and china railway construction corp.  -- organizations already sanctioned by the u. s.  -- are among the state-backed firms backing the effort, one of the people said.  another government-linked giant, china electronics corp. , is one of the leaders in third-generation chip development, thanks to its investment in smaller firms including cec semiconductor co.  using its own in-house technology, cec semiconductor makes silicone carbide-based power devices that can work at 200 degrees celsius (360 degrees fahrenheit) for a number of key industries from telecommunications to electric cars -- reducing china's reliance on overseas suppliers such as infineon technologies ag, rohm co.  and cree inc. shares of chipmakers climbed, with smic rallying more than 8% in shanghai, set for its biggest one-day gain since october.  shares of national silicon industry group co. , will semiconductor co.  and maxscend microelectronics co.  also advanced.  sanan optoelectronics co.  and wingtech technology co.  -- among firms seen as potential beneficiaries of china's third-generation chip effort -- gained 10% and 8%, respectively. the task of coordinating that sprawling program now falls to liu, who has to keep track of the relevant resources and drive the national strategy to help china achieve chip independence. ""for our country, technology and innovation is not just a matter of growth,"" liu told a three-story auditorium packed with china's top scientists in a separate meeting in may.  ""it's also a matter of survival. ""read more: biden needs more than $52 billion to counter china in chipsxi is counting on his lieutenant to help china fend off growing threats from the u. s. , which is seeking to take back chip industry supremacy.  under the trump administration, sanctions were slapped on chinese giants from huawei to smic, cutting off their access to american technology and equipment crucial to designing and making advanced logic chips.  president joe biden has also laid out a $52 billion plan to bolster domestic chip manufacturing, while calling on allies to join export controls aimed at curbing beijing's drive toward technology self-sufficiency. rival powerhouse nations like south korea and leading corporations such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co.  have also responded with their own spending plans, fueling the race to take the lead in the sector. read more: china revs up grand chip ambitions to counter u. s.  blacklistingswith traditional chipmaking facing a series of challenges from technology development to heavy capital investment, third-generation chips -- which use compounds such as gallium nitride and silicon carbide to significantly improve the performance of semiconductors that power a wide range of industries and products -- may offer china its best chance to overcome rivals, senior academic mao junfa told an industry event in nanjing earlier this month.

2021-06-17,Malaysia: Law Minister Takiyuddin says King did not specify when Parliament should reconvene.,"kuala lumpur, malaysia â de facto law minister takiyuddin hassan has come under fire from members of the public for stating that the king did not specify when parliament should reconvene, after his majesty had called for sittings to resume ""as soon as possible"". comptroller of the royal household, ahmad fadil shamsuddin, in a statement from the national palace on wednesday (16 june), said that al-sultan abdullah ri'ayatuddin al-mustafa billah shah recognises parliament's role as ""an important platform"" for elected representatives to discuss various issues of public importance, including the covid-19 in the country. ""his majesty is of the opinion that having a stable and solid government that can effectively manage the covid-19 pandemic and rehabilitate the nation's economy is imperative,"" the statement read. allowing parliament to reconvene will enable members of parliament (mps) to discuss pressing matters such as the government's spending allocation for the purpose of assisting the people, especially those who are currently facing economic hardship as a result of the pandemic and the restrictions imposed because of it. ""after deliberating on the views of political leaders as well as those of the independent commission on the emergency 2021 and experts from government agencies, his majesty expressed the view that parliament sittings must be held as soon as possible,"" said the comptroller. this is to enable mps to debate the emergency ordinances and the national recovery plan, he said. the palace's announcement came after al-sultan abdullah chaired a special meeting with the council of rulers on wednesday. takiyuddin in a discussion with bicara harakah the same day, however, said: ""his majesty did not specify any particular date . . .  he said it should be held as soon as possible.  so the prime minister can announce, for example, that parliament will reopen in september or october. ""takiyuddin also said that the number of people to be admitted into the parliament physical space has to be taken into consideration when deliberating on the reopening of the house. ""you need to take into account the number of people who will be present.  a closed area like the dewan rakyat could accommodate 222 mps.  but what about the government officers on duty, the heralds for the speaker, deputy speaker, and secretary to the dewan rakyat?"" he questioned. takiyuddin added that members of the public present outside the halls and parliament staff must also be taken into view when considering whether to allow parliament to reconvene at this stage. ""we have been informed that every time parliament convenes, there are at least 1,000 people on the grounds,"" he said, noting that such is why only a hybrid parliament configuration would be feasible at this point. ""this way, we will determine who will attend the sittings as well as the number of mps attending, among other (criteria).  in tandem with parliamentary rules, the minimum quorum needed for the dewan rakyat and dewan negara would be 26 mps and 10 senators, respectively,"" said takiyuddin. legal issues, however, may pose barriers to even a hybrid parliament configuration. ""the standing orders state that attendance by mps must be physical, and those not in attendance physically cannot vote,"" said takiyuddin.  for a hybrid parliament to be materialised, said takiyuddin, amendments must be made to the standing orders. ""so this hybrid parliament needs to be studied and prepared for.  but i wish to stress that the government remains committed to the democratic process involving parliament. ""the prime minister has stated that the government will reconvene parliament once it is confident that standard operating procedures can be met.  it is not that we do not wish to reopen parliament, but it will be done in accordance with the new norms,"" takiyuddin said. many commenters criticised takiyuddin's remarks in the livestream, asking why the minister appears to be challenging the royal opinion and ""shifting the goalposts"" by stating that ""as soon as possible"" could mean some time in september. the ""goalposts"" remark was made in reference to takiyuddin's response to the dewan rakyat's deputy speaker, azalina othman said's statement on the cabinet's role in advising the king regarding the emergency. the government, she said, should not ""shift the goalposts"" just as the emergency period approaches the finish line. ""no one is shifting the goalposts, what's being done is adjusting the rules of the game to help the referee make the right judgement.  'to achieve goals does not mean to change the goal post',"" said takiyuddin in a tweet on 12 june. tiada siapa yang alih tiang gol, yang dibuat adalah betulkan peraturan permainan supaya membantu referee buat pengadilan yang betul.  ""to achieve goals does not mean to change the goal post"".  pic. twitter. com/7wgmrnmngpâ takiyuddin haji hassan (@takiyuddin61) june 12, 2021one commenter urged takiyuddin: ""what are you waiting for dato, issue a memo for (parliament) sitting tonight.  let the sittings commence next week. . """"the king asked for parliament to reconvene immediately to enable the emergency to be discussed and debated by members of parliament.  that has to be prioritised.  do not speak nonsense,"" said another. ""this government has failed to the point of forcing his majesty to call a meeting with the malay rulers and other parties to discuss the nation's future,"" one commenter said. ""ministers have received two doses of (the covid-19) vaccine. .  the king has already given his decree. .  so don't give stupid excuses to avoid reopening parliament,"" said one commenter. ""who are you to question (the king's decree).  enough, reopen parliament.  put your pfizer jab to good use,"" another chimed in. one commenter questioned the need for a hybrid parliament â one comprising physical and virtual sittings â saying that many others do not have the option to work online. ""just go.  thousands of factory workers come (to work as usual).  seems ok,"" they said. ""what is there to be proud of with receiving many ventilators during the emergency when cases are spiking simultaneously? repeated mcos. . .  many committing suicide due to extreme distress in life (during this period).  they did not die because of covid,"" said one commenter. during the total lockdown, most economic sectors remain closed, except for essential services such as supermarkets and pharmacies.  as a result, many people whose professions do not offer the option to work from home are placed on unpaid leave or are even laid off. last week, the king had a succession of physical meetings with political leaders such as umno president ahmad zahid hamidi and leaders from the pakatan harapan coalition. ahmad zahid said on 11 june that he had mooted the prospect during his hour-long audience with sultan abdullah ""to ensure the country's democratic system is defended"". ""it was obvious that even without the emergency, the government could previously handle matters related to fighting the covid-19 pandemic,"" he added. while calling for an end to the emergency, the bagan datuk mp also proposed the resumption of parliament sittings. ""umno believes that parliament is an important official platform to voice the people's concerns (on matters such) such as loan moratoriums, i-sinar and i-lestari 2. 0 and other forms of assistance for everyone,"" he said. ahmad zahid is one of several politicians who have openly spoken up against the state of emergency and the suspension of parliament, the latter of which is enabled by the former. parti keadilan rakyat president anwar ibrahim in january filed a suit against muhyiddin and the federal government, on the grounds that the latter had allegedly advised the nation's king to suspend parliament sittings during the state of emergency. malay mail reported that in a separate statement filed in court, anwar had argued that the suspension of parliament under emergency powers blocks parliament's freedom to ensure transparent debates, government accountability, and proper checks and balances on the executive branch of the government in making and enacting laws during the pandemic. anwar was also one of the politicians who have met with the king this week.  he was granted an audience with sultan abdullah with parti amanah negara president mohamad sabu and democratic action party (dap) secretary-general lim guan eng â all component parties of the pakatan harapan coalition. former prime minister mahathir mohamad, whose parti pejuang tanah air political party has yet to be registered, also had a meeting with the king, during which he proposed the setting up of a national operations council (mageran) in the present circumstances. mageran was set up after the 13 may racial riots in 1969 to restore the rule of law and order in the country. several political leaders have since challenged dr mahathir's proposal to establish mageran. ahmad zahid told reporters that the idea of mageran should have been brought forth at the start of the emergency period. he added that he did not discuss the mageran issue with the king. ""i feel it is something normal outside the scope of the existing situation because the emergency is supposed to cover it but it has been used to achieve other purposes,"" said ahmad zahid. in a joint statement, anwar, mohamad sabu, and lim said that their objection is grounded in their belief that for a parliamentary democracy to truly function, the emergency must be lifted and parliament must be allowed to reconvene. ""the solution to the people's problems in relation to covid-19, the economy and even politics requires a democracy that functions well, and the best avenue to hear out their grievances and to find solutions to them is parliament,"" they said. prime minister muhyiddin yassin earlier in march defended the emergency proclamation, stating that it is not a tool for him to cling on to his position but a pre-emptive move in managing the covid-19 situation in the country. the emergency would be lifted earlier than its scheduled end on 1 august if the government is able to control the pandemic situation in the country, he added. ""if the independent special committee says [the emergency] can be put to an end earlier, i will just follow that.  we also do not want to be under restriction by such regulations forever,"" said muhyiddin.

of the opinion that having a stable and solid government that can effectively manage the covid-19 pandemic and rehabilitate the nation\'s economy is imperative,"" the statement read.', ""allowing

2021-06-17,Putin and Biden will not be friends but see path together.,"geneva: there was no talk of gazing into vladimir putin's ""soul"" and the russian president didn't try to gaslight a rookie us leader. instead, putin's first summit with the fifth us president of his tenure, joe biden, was about mutual respect and themeeting in genevacould, both of them said, lead to a more predictable, if still tense, relationship. in contrast to his predecessors, biden made no suggestion he expected to reset the relationship and he has already piled pressure on russia over concerns including alleged election meddling, attacks by cybercriminals against the colonial pipeline and other us infrastructure and over the poisoning and jailing of dissident alexei navalny. but after earlier remarks that included calling putin ""a killer"", biden on the eve of the summit described the russian leader as ""a worthy adversary"" and at a news conference afterward said that they would see where they had common interests. putin, who at his 2018 summit with donald trump in helsinki was widely seen as dominating the reality television star turned president, called biden ""a very experienced politician"" who was able to speak in rare detail in the ""very constructive"" more than three hours of talks. ""biden generally is someone who wants constructive relations.  he doesn't consider putin a friend,"" said ian bremmer, president of the eurasia group political risk firm. similar to his view of chinese president xi jinping, biden ""doesn't trust them but he does expect russia will act in its interest and the two countries have some interests that overlap and where we should work together,"" bremmer said. bremmer said the test of the relationship will come afterward. ""i want to see that in the next three months we have materially fewer ransomware incidents and nothing of the scale that we had against colonial pipeline that comes from russia.  that's absolutely critical. ""groundwork for futureputin made no promises at his news conference on cybercrime, appearing to deny russian involvement, but biden, signalling that he sent a warning, said that putin""knows there are consequences""for russian actions. the leaders said they would return ambassadors to each other's capitals and that diplomats would work on the release of prisoners.

2021-06-17,"S'pore's labour market continues recovery into 1st quarter; total employment grows by 12,200, Jobs News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore singapore's labour market continued its recovery in the first quarter, with total employment growing for the first time since the start of the covid-19 pandemic. a report by the ministry of manpower (mom) on thursday (june 17) showed that the total employment, excluding foreign domestic workers, rose by 12,200 in the first three months of the year, after four consecutive quarters of decline.  this far surpassed the preliminary estimate of 4,800 released in april. resident hires continued to rise, outpacing the decline in non-resident employment, which is partly due to restrictions on the inflow of foreign workers. this increase was driven by the broad hiring of residents in the service sectors, such as information and communications, food and beverage, health and social services, and administrative and support services. more retrenched residents here have also found jobs within six months, while job vacancies have risen to nearly match the unemployed population, according to the report. but the labour market is still not fully back to its pre-pandemic state, said mom. moreover, uncertainties in the economy and the recent tightened measures during phase two (heightened alert) are expected to weigh on the pace of labour market recovery in the second quarter. manpower minister tan see leng said singapore's path to recovery ""will not be a straight road"", and will entail some twists and potential roadblocks. ""recovery is also expected to be more uneven across sectors than earlier expected,"" said dr tan, speaking to the media after visiting the procter & gamble singapore innovation centre at biopolis on wednesday (june 16). unemployment rates continued to ease, after peaking in september last year at 3. 5 per cent for the overall workforce, 4. 9 per cent for citizens and 4. 8 per cent for residents. in march, this dropped to 2. 9 per cent overall, 4. 2 per cent for citizens and 4 per cent for residents.  the rates are still higher than pre-pandemic unemployment levels. retrenchments, however, fell for the second consecutive quarter to pre-pandemic levels, said mom.  the re-entry rate of retrenched residents into employment also rose for two consecutive quarters, to 66. 2 per cent. as business activities picked up, the number of workers placed on shorter work weeks or temporary layoffs also declined, from 8,710 in the fourth quarter of last year to 4,020 in the first quarter of this year. meanwhile, the number of job vacancies rose to 68,400 in march, exceeding the last high of 65,500 in march 2015. the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed persons also improved, to 0. 96 or nearly one job vacancy for every unemployed person in march.  this is an increase from a ratio of 0. 75 in december last year. associate professor lawrence loh from the national university of singapore business school said the first quarter performance is expected, as it follows on the heels of the recovering covid-19 situation in the latter part of last year. ""however, it is too early to say that there is a turnaround in the employment trend,"" he stressed, adding that singapore is not out of the woods just yet. ""employment normally lags economic growth â given the restricted situation in the second quarter now, the decline in economic activity is likely to affect the job market in the next quarter and beyond. ""foreign employment growth is likely to continue its decline, given ongoing border restrictions.  this could lead to labour shortages in sectors like construction. to help construction companies cope with the manpower crunch, the government has introduced a temporary scheme that would make it easier to recruit workers from china, where the coronavirus situation is more stable and fewer restrictions are in force. chinese work permit holders usually obtain their skills certification from overseas training centres in china, but they will now be allowed to get certified in singapore instead. maybank kim eng senior economist chua hak bin said the labour market recovery is k-shaped, with a stark divergence between resident and non-resident employment.  ""the divergent and uneven labour market recovery will likely continue in the second quarter, given even stricter border and quarantine controls under the heightened measures,"" he added.  ""wage pressures may surface earlier than expected as the resident labour market tightens, even though employment is still far below pre-pandemic levels. the government has also put in place various schemes for employers to access a wider pool of talent, from career conversion programmes to the jobs growth incentive that encourages employers to bring forward the hiring of local workers through wage subsidies. dr tan said businesses here have to innovate, from digitalisation to developing niche capabilities. ""as businesses transform, the workforce must be reskilled and upskilled to keep pace with the changing needs,"" he added. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright Â© 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-17,First astronauts arrive at China's space station.,"jiuquan: the first astronauts arrived at china's new space station on thursday (jun 17) in the country's longest crewed mission to date, a landmark step in establishing beijing as a major space power. the trio blasted off on a long march-2f rocket from the jiuquan launch centre in northwest china's gobi desert, and their craft docked at the tiangong station around seven hours later, where they will spend the next three months. state broadcaster cctv showed a live feed from inside the spacecraft during the journey, with the three astronauts lifting their helmet visors after it reached orbit as one smiled and waved at the camera. another floated a pen just off his lap in zero-gravity as he browsed the flight manual. around seven hours after lift-off, space officials confirmed that the craft had docked with tianhe, the core module of the country's new space station. the shenzhou-12 craft has ""successfully docked with the forward port of the core module"" of the tiangong station, said the china manned space agency, as state tv showed live footage. at a ceremony before blast-off, the three astronauts, already wearing their space suits, greeted a crowd of supporters and space workers, who sang the patriotic song without the chinese communist party, there would be no new china. by thursday evening, the astronauts were shown on television entering the core module, one of them making a 360-degree flip in the process. the group will be setting up their living quarters and are expected to open the door to the tianzhou-2 cargo craft which docked earlier with the core module on friday morning. the mission's commander is nie haisheng, a decorated air force pilot in the people's liberation army who has already participated in two space missions. the two other members are also from the military. space lifethe tianhe module of the space station has separate living spaces for each of the astronauts, a ""space treadmill"" and bike for exercise, and a communication centre for emails and video calls with ground control. huang weifen of the china manned space program said the astronauts will perform two spacewalks during the mission, both lasting around six or seven hours. she also said the trio will wear newly-developed spacewalk suits. the launch of china's first crewed mission in nearly five years is a matter of huge prestige in china, as beijing prepares to mark the 100th anniversary of the ruling communist party on jul 1 with a massive propaganda campaign. to prepare for the mission, the crew underwent more than 6,000 hours of training, including hundreds of underwater somersaults in full space gear. the chinese space agency is planning a total of 11 launches through to the end of next year, including three more manned missions that will deliver two lab modules to expand the 70-tonne station, along with supplies and crew members. china's space ambitions have been fuelled in part by a us ban on its astronauts on the international space station, a collaboration between the united states, russia, canada, europe and japan. it is due for retirement after 2024, even though nasa has said it could potentially remain functional beyond 2028. tiangong will be much smaller than the iss, and is expected to have a lifespan of at least 10 years. china has said it would be open to international collaboration on its space station although it has yet to give specific details. zhou jianping, chief designer for the space programme, said ""foreign astronauts are certainly going to enter the chinese space station one day"". ""there are a number of countries that have expressed a desire to do that and we will be open to that in future,"" he said. beijing said in march it was also planning to build a separate lunar space station with russia, and this week the two countries issued a ""roadmap"" for potential collaboration opportunities. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-17,Family left in shock by shooting of young Palestinian woman.,"jerusalem: mai afaneh appeared to have a happy family life and a fulfilling career.  so when she left her west bank home early on wednesday, no one thought anything was wrong. but a short while later, her family received the devastating news that she had been shot and killed by israeli troops, allegedly after carrying out an attempted car-ramming attack. in just a few short moments, she became another statistic the latest in a list of palestinians killed by the israeli military under unclear circumstances. the cases play out in a similar pattern.  the army reports an attempted attack by a palestinian assailant, usually acting alone and unaffiliated with any militant group.  then, it says troops ""neutralised"" the attacker. some 20 israelis have been killed in shootings, stabbings and car-ramming attacks since 2018, according to israel's foreign ministry.  many others have been badly hurt. but not all cases are clear.  in cases without israeli casualties, sometimes there is video evidence to support the account.  other times, there isn't. human rights groups say many of the attackers could have been stopped without killing them, and in some cases, have suggested innocent people were killed. military investigations are sometimes launched but rarely provide clarity and almost never find wrongdoing on the part of troops.  families, meanwhile, are left wondering what really happened to their loved ones. afaneh, who was 28, left an inconclusive trail of clues behind her.  she had suffered some health problems.  there were some distraught facebook posts about palestinians killed by israel.  but relatives said she had no reason or ability to carry out an attack. she had earned her doctorate in psychology in jordan, was happily teaching at a local university and had a good family life with her husband and 5-year-old daughter, relatives said. ""she was not politically affiliated.  all she cared about was her studies and helping her family and husband,"" said her father, khaled afaneh. he said the previous night she was laughing and talkative before dropping off her daughter to spend the night with the grandparents.  he said she needed colon surgery, had just gotten out of the hospital and was very weak. ""even if she really wanted to attack, they could easily stop her.  there was no justification to kill her,"" he said, speaking at the family's home in abu dis, a town on the eastern outskirts of jerusalem. according to the military, afaneh drove her car toward a group of soldiers who were guarding a construction site in hizmeh, about a half-hour drive from her home, then got out of the vehicle brandishing a knife before she was shot. the military said one soldier was lightly injured jumping out of the way of the car.  it said there were no security cameras at the scene so it couldn't provide footage of the incident. ""i believe she lost control over the car.  maybe she entered the wrong way,"" said her uncle, usama afaneh.  ""i don't believe she intended to do anything.  it's not her nature. ""the uncle said she had told her husband that morning that she was going out to pick up some breakfast.  he had no idea how she ended up so far away from the house but speculated she was on her way to the city of ramallah, where she sometimes did work for her university. despite her upbeat demeanour, some of afaneh's posts on social media were troubling. on may 15, at the height of israel's war against hamas militants in the gaza strip last month, she posted a photo of what appears to be a dead palestinian child. ""we will stay here, either martyrdom or victory,"" she wrote.  a smaller photo showed her with a palestinian flag painted on her face.  on instagram, she wrote: ""there is no more life left to live. ""the following day, under the same photo of the child, she wrote on facebook: ""my little one, your tears are cleaner than zamzam water,"" referring to a spring in saudi arabia that is revered by muslims.  ""we will give birth to children even if we know that they will be martyrs in the future. ""her father played down the posts, saying they were written at the height of a bloody war and reflected the general mood of palestinians at the time.  he said he remained in shock as he searched for answers. ""i didn't expect this to happen.  actually i don't know what happened.  nobody has seen what happened,"" he said. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-17,It used to feel that life hung in the balance during US-Russia summits. No longer.,"a transformed global context and the rise of china put any decisions made at biden's meeting with putin into perspectivelast modified on thu 17 jun 2021 05. 13 edtjoe biden's meeting with vladimir putin in geneva looked like a summit, sounded like a summit, and in some genuine senses really was a summit.  but it was not an east-west superpower summit in the 20th-century sense.  it was a bilateral meeting between the leaders of two important countries whose relations are possibly more difficult today than they were in the cold war.  yet life on earth did not seem to hang in the balance yesterday, as it sometimes could do back then. throughout its history russia has often been simultaneously strong and weak, at home and abroad.  now, in a century marked by growing chinese power and the deep polarisation of its domestic politics, something similar can be said of the united states, too.  relative decline has not made either country less suspicious of the other.  perhaps the most significant thing about their meeting was therefore that it occurred at all.  but these two countries no longer bestride the globe. biden's first presidential swing through europe has been choreographed to vindicate his claim that the us is back on the world stage after the chaos of donald trump.  that claim needs to be interrogated carefully.  biden's foreign policy team is full of experience.  the administration is committed to alliances in ways trump was not.  even so, the lessons of geneva, and of the g7 and nato meetings that preceded it, are that the us is back, but necessarily in a different way and in a different world. the immediate evidence for this is that both the g7 and the nato meetings focused as much on china as on russia.  in cornwall the g7 attacked both countries: china for its internal repression and for the unexplained origins of the covid pandemic; russia for its use of biological and cyber weapons.  in brussels the next day, nato leaders did the same: china was portrayed as an expansionist power whose increased military ambitions require an alliance response, while russia's ukraine policy, weapons buildup and hacking were described as aggressive threats. there are important nuances in all this.  some european countries, jealous to guard their trade links with china and fearful of how the us may vote in 2024, are reluctant to join biden's stronger critique.  the g7 therefore failed to agree on an aid package to counter beijing's massive and well-established overseas belt and road initiative, or a vaccine aid programme that would address the scale of asian and african need.  nato's communique also distinguished carefully between the chinese ""challenge"" and the russian ""threat"". the shift of focus to china, driven by the us under both biden and trump, is nevertheless a big strategic event.  the reorientation of nato, in particular, is remarkable.  but it throws into relief the massive question of whether the western nations possess either the will or resources to carry it through.  the signs of division this week will have been noted in beijing.  the west may will the ends, but it does not yet will the means.  biden's visit to europe was greeted with immense relief, but its practical effects have yet to be tested. any temptation to suppose the international order has simply hit the resume button after an unwelcome four-year pause should therefore be resisted.  nevertheless, a us-russia summit in geneva still has the capacity to resonate.  it was in the lakeside swiss city, after all, where the two sides came together in 1955 in a tentative effort to ease the cold war.  it was there that 1982's ""walk in the woods"" produced hopes of an end to the nuclear arms race.  and it was in geneva where, three years later, the reagan-gorbachev talks helped quicken a process that would lead to the peaceful collapse of the soviet union.  that, however, was all more than 30 years ago. yesterday's biden-putin meeting offered surface continuity with aspects of that past, but crucially not the content.  the us and russia remain major powers, but each is diminished and must operate in the new global context.  china's rise is not the only factor in this.  the stagnation of european prosperity, the growing dynamism of asia and the potential of africa matter, too.  this is also the era of the climate crisis and the daily deployment of cyberweapons, not just of the potentially world-ending nuclear armageddon that dominated post-1945 international relations. that certainly did not mean there was nothing for the us and russia to discuss yesterday, or that the summit was unimportant.  but the task facing the two is difficult in new ways.  the us and russia are fighting a permanent, mostly low-level conflict.  biden is right to explore the viability of more settled relations.  putin was right to emerge from his covid-secure cocoon to explore whether biden takes russia seriously and is willing to do business with moscow. none of this is likely to happen soon, though.  the best that can be hoped is for a gradually emerging process and some protocols.  however, once the geneva spotlight is dimmed there are, at least in theory, possible bargains that can be explored on cyber, on climate and even potentially on geopolitical issues such as russia's near-abroad and the middle east, just as there still are on arms.  these are complex and interwoven issues.  they require immense amounts of patient talk, with measured approaches to building necessary degrees of trust, not least with cautious allies.  that is in short supply already, as this week showed.  the difficulty of some of the compromises that could be involved suggest this may not change any time soon. martin

2021-06-17,Malaysian king says Parliament must resume despite emergency.,"kuala lumpur, malaysia â malaysia's king said wednesday that parliament, which has been suspended under a coronavirus emergency since january, must resume as soon as possible, but stopped short of saying the emergency should end. the monarch's comments contrasted with those of prime minister muhyiddin yassin, who said a day earlier that parliament can only reopen if new coronavirus infections fall below 2,000 per day and 40% of the population is fully vaccinated.  he predicted that could be in september or october. king sultan abdullah sultan ahmad shah said he believes parliament ""needs to resume as soon as possible"" after consulting with various political leaders, an independent committee advising him on the emergency, and various experts. he said in a statement issued by the palace that lawmakers should be able to discuss the government's spending allocations to help citizens in distress and efforts to bolster economic recovery. sultan abdullah approved muhyiddin's emergency plan in early january.  the plan was slammed by critics as a political ruse to help the embattled prime minister stay in power amid challenges to his leadership. the emergency, which is due to end aug.  1, suspends parliament but includes no other measures.  muhyiddin's government remains in control and has extraordinary powers to introduce laws without parliamentary approval. it is unclear if muhyiddin's comments tuesday were an indication that he plans to seek an extension of the emergency.  if he does, the king's remarks wednesday mean the monarch is unlikely to approve it. the palace statement came after the king met wednesday with the conference of rulers, comprising nine ethnic malay state rulers.  in a blow to muhyiddin, they issued a separate strongly worded statement saying the emergency hasn't helped curb the pandemic and needn't be extended beyond aug.  1. the rulers supported growing calls for parliament to resume swiftly, saying the government must be accountable to the people in terms of its spending and that efforts to fight the pandemic must not be seen as having a hidden political agenda. muhyiddin took power in march 2020 after instigating the collapse of mahathir's reformist alliance that won 2018 elections and joining with the opposition to form a malay-centric government.  but his government is shaky with a razor-thin majority in parliament.  muhyiddin faces challenges from within his coalition and from the opposition, but support for his leadership cannot be tested with parliament suspended. critics noted daily infections surged to more than 9,000 last month, nearly five times as much as when the emergency was imposed, forcing the government to impose a large-scale lockdown since june that banned social and business activities.  new infections still exceed 5,000 a day, with the country's confirmed total breaching 673,000 and deaths exceeding 4,100. the malay rulers play a largely ceremonial role but have been vocal in politics recently.  they are highly regarded by the country's malay majority as the guardians of islam and malay tradition. the king and state rulers said vaccinations are key and urged the government to reduce bureaucracy and accelerate efforts to achieve its aim of inoculating up to 80% of the country's 33 million people.  just over 10% of the population has now been vaccinated. the king had already said in february that parliament can convene despite the emergency order, but muhyiddin's government argued it wasn't safe because there are many older lawmakers. the most important news stories of the day, curated by post editors and delivered every morning. by signing up you agree to our

2021-06-17,"Eriksen backs team for must-win game, Football News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. copenhagen â¢ denmark can take heart that christian eriksen is recovering and will be cheering them on as they try to salvage their euro 2020 campaign against belgium in copenhagen today. kasper hjulmand's side know that their qualification from group b will be in jeopardy if they get the same treatment that the belgians dished out to russia in a 3-0 win on saturday, and they need to bounce back from their traumatic 1-0 defeat by finland. eriksen told the world on tuesday that he was ""fine under the circumstances"" following his sickening mid-match cardiac arrest and said he will be right behind the teammates who rallied to his side as medics rushed to save his life. hjulmand said in a press conference that the 29-year-old midfielder was in daily contact with the rest of the team and was trying to gee up his friends before they face the world's top-ranked team. ""we can focus more and more on football and prepare for the game,"" he said, but admitted that some players might still be rattled. ""we will prepare ourselves as well as possible, but it will be emotional for sure.  but we should use these emotions for the match, and get ready to fight. ""he did not want to go into details about who would replace eriksen in the line-up. ""no one can replace christian.  no one.  it's not possible. . .  he is the heart of the team,"" the coach said. ""we will do something else, we'll do something different but we will definitely have a strong team on the pitch. ""the match will be played at the parken stadium, where denmark will have the backing of 25,000 fans after the scandinavian nation relaxed coronavirus restrictions. the 16,000 home fans present for the finland match created a wall of noise in the first half as denmark piled on the pressure, and will be in even fuller voice to cheer on their team today. some have taken to spray-painting murals in honour of their missing star around copenhagen. no one can replace christian.  no one.  it's not possible. . .  he is the heart of the team. denmark will need all the support they can get against eriksen's inter milan teammate romelu lukaku, whose ominous double in belgium's win over the russians showed why at the age of just 28 he is by some distance belgium's record scorer with 62 goals. belgium top group b on goal difference ahead of russia and can seal their passage to the knockout stage with a game to spare. roberto martinez's side have been further boosted by the news that borussia dortmund midfielder alex witsel is available after recovering from an achilles tendon injury which had kept him out of action since january. witsel began running only about a month ago but belgium's physiotherapist lieven maesschalck, who guided the player's recovery, said ""he isn't scared"" about his return.  ""he is ready to play even if the risk of a relapse isn't zero,"" said maesschalck on tuesday. the news comes after playmaker kevin de bruyne trained with the squad for the first time on monday, sparking hopes he could too play a role against the danes. the manchester city playmaker missed the russia match after having surgery for nose and eye socket fractures suffered in last month's champions league final. meanwhile, eden hazard, who had done little training with the squad after an injury-filled season at real madrid, played 20 minutes against russia and martinez wants his captain to be involved today. ""i was very happy with his appearance and think it was a massive step forward.  he is playing again with freedom and intuition,"" the belgium coach said.  ""now it will be important that he shows this over 90 minutes.  against denmark, he will have to see more action.

2021-06-17,"Taiwan reports largest incursion yet by Chinese air force, Asia News.","taipei, june 15 twenty-eight chinese air force aircraft, including fighters and nuclear-capable bombers, entered taiwan's air defence identification zone (adiz) on tuesday (june 15), the island's government said, the largest reported incursion to date. while there was no immediate comment from beijing, the news comes after the group of seven leaders issued a joint statement on sunday scolding china for a series of issues and underscored the importance of peace and stability across the taiwan strait, comments china condemned as ""slander"" . chinese-claimed taiwan has complained over the last few months of repeated missions by china's air force near the self-ruled island, concentrated in the southwestern part of its air defence zone near the taiwan-controlled pratas islands. the latest chinese mission involved 14 j-16 and six j-11 fighters, as well as four h-6 bombers, which can carry nuclear weapons, and anti-submarine, electronic warfare and early warning aircraft, taiwan's defence ministry said. [[nid:526703]]it was the largest daily incursion since the ministry began regularly reporting chinese air force activities in taiwan's adiz last year, breaking the previous record of 25 aircraft reported on april 12. the ministry added that taiwanese combat aircraft were dispatched to intercept and warn away the chinese aircraft, while missile systems were also deployed to monitor them. not only did the chinese aircraft fly in an area close to the pratas islands, but the bombers and some of the fighters flew around the southern part of taiwan close to the bottom tip of the island, according to a map the ministry provided. china's defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment. china has in the past described such missions as necessary to protect the country's sovereignty and deal with ""collusion"" between taipei and washington. the united states, which like most countries has no formal diplomatic ties with taiwan, has watched with alarm the stepped up tensions with beijing.
