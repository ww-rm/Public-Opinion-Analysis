2021-06-12,"Negotiations on wage increases for workers in security, landscape and lift and escalator sectors to be concluded soon: Tan See Leng.","singapore: workers in the security, landscape, and lift and escalator sectors may soon see their salaries increase further under the progressive wage model, with tripartite partners ""confident"" they can conclude negotiations in the next few months, said manpower minister tan see leng. at a media briefing about the progressive wage model on thursday (jun 10), mr tan said recommendations for the three sectors were currently in the pipeline and that newly-formedtripartite clusters for food services, retail, andwaste managementwere also making headway. ""the (tripartite workgroup on lower-wage workers) is looking at ways to cover the various occupational groups under progressive wages, and this will benefit low wage workers employed in similar occupations but distributed across the various sectors,"" he said, adding that the workgroup will share more on the plans soon. the update comes a day after the government accepted proposals by the tripartite cluster for cleaners (tcc)to increase the wages of cleanerseach year over six years from 2023, under the progressive wage model. it was the first wage review since the workgroup was launched in october last year to look into the salaries of low-wage workers and to improve their well-being. senior minister of state for manpower zaqy mohamad, who chairs the workgroup, said the timeline for the roll-out of the wage increases will give employers time to adapt. ""they have many contract obligations that typically run two to three years, so you must also be fair with the industry to adapt because they have committed salaries for existing contracts,"" he said. ""the six-year schedule also provides service buyers and providers with clarity on wage cost increases so that they can plan for the long term, and cleaning firms are also able to now price in wage increases in the next multi-year contracts that they have with the service buyers,"" he added. he gave assurance that cleaners' wages will continue to grow from now to 2023, under an existing agreement that stipulates annual increments of 3 per cent each year. during the briefing, national trades union congress (ntuc) secretary-general ng chee meng explained the challenges behind implementing the progressive wage model for various sectors. ""this is a very difficult journey . . .  it's not so easy as a blanket policy (dictating) that these are the wages, but it gives the ecosystem a runway that is sustainable that would benefit and create a win-win (situation) for both workers and employers,"" he said. when asked why it takes a long time for the model to be implemented, mr ng said the model is a more ""involved"" process that may take a bit more time. ""if you set (wages) too high . . .  workers may well be made redundant, loss of jobs, because businesses cannot carry that cost, they will exit, or even if they don't exit, workers may lose their jobs,"" he added. ""if you set it too low, then it becomes actually a wage ceiling for workers.  if my real productivity deserves s$20, s$25 an hour and we got it quite wrong, as in many other practices of minimum wage when it's set too low, then actually, it becomes a wage ceiling.  this (is) what i mentioned . . .  as potential downsides of (a) minimum wage. ""responding to a question about how the wage increases which only apply to singaporeans and permanent residents might push more employers to hire foreigners to lower manpower costs, mr tan said existing measures such as employment quota and qualifying salary requirements are in place. ""so, there will be more initiatives that you can see that would look very . . .  comprehensively at this foreign versus local talent and workforce complementarity,"" added the manpower minister. pwm vs minimum wagecurrently, the progressive wage model is mandatory for the cleaning, security and landscape industries.  it was designed to raise the salaries of lower-wage workers by upgrading their skills and increasing their productivity. there have been numerous debates on the merits and effectiveness of the progressive wage model compared with a minimum wage system. during the briefing, mr zaqy compared singapore's progressive wage model to the minimum wage system implemented in other countries, such as the us and uk.  he said the progressive wage model has brought about sustained wage increases in singapore over almost a decade. in contrast, the federal minimum wage system implemented in the us has been stuck at us$7. 25 per hour since 2009 due to ""political wrangling"", he said. he added that while the uk has increased its minimum wage, the country has also seen a significant increase in zero-hour contracts, where employers are not obliged to provide any minimum working hours and workers do not have to accept any work offered. ""the government is not against minimum wage.  in fact, we have taken some parts of this in our social innovation because we take the best of breed from what we see out there,"" he said. ""so you see that the bottom rungs of our (progressive wage model) have some elements of minimum wage but we didn't stop there, we created ladders to create career progression. ""businesses, consumers must do their partas the progressive wage model expands to cover more sectors, businesses must continue to transform through automation and job redesign to help uplift the wages of their workers, said dr robert yap, president of the singapore national employers federation (snef). he added that workers will also have to upskill to stay relevant and ensure career progression. mr zaqy added that the government will continue to help bear some of the cost increases through salary top-ups such as the workfare income supplement scheme.  this is to ensure that the impact of the cost increases is not solely borne by businesses or consumers.  society must be prepared to do its part too, he said. ""this is really about addressing social inequality . . .  as an advanced country and mature country like singapore, this is where we need to take our society forward,"" he said. ""for us to say . . .  we want to care for low-wage workers but not pay them a decent salary, not support them as a society, that cannot stand for too long,"" he added. ""this is where society needs to extend its support for low wage workers.  we may have to expect to pay a bit more, but i think if we know, deep in our heart that it supports, encourages and it's giving recognition to our low wage workers, our essential workers, for the work that they do.  it is something that we must be prepared to support as a society.

2021-06-12,Racism exists but Singapore has made 'tremendous progress' in racial harmony: Shanmugam.,"singapore: while racism exists, singapore has made ""tremendous progress"" in racial harmony over the years, said law and home affairs minister k shanmugam on thursday (jun 10) in an interview with cna938. his comments follow recent incidents of alleged racism in public.  last week, a viral video emerged showing aman making racist remarkstowards an interracial couple at orchard road. in another incident last month,a 55-year-old woman was allegedly kickedand subjected to racial slurs by a 30-year-old man while she was brisk walking. when asked during the interview if singapore's racial harmony is on a knife-edge, mr shanmugam said: ""i've always said there is racism in singapore, but we are a better society than most other multi-racial societies that i know of. ""i mean, name me a society where there is no racism, which is multi-racial? i've felt that we have made tremendous progress. ""he added: ""most people accept the norms of a multiracial society and we are making progress.  the direction was positive and direction has been positive. ""mr shanmugam had said last week following the incident at orchard road that he is ""not so sure anymore"" that singapore is ""moving in the right direction"" on racial tolerance. ""it's the direction that i'm concerned about,"" he added on thursday.  ""but as of today, i won't say we are at knife-edge.  i think that will be over-dramatising it. ""mr shanmugam also said that people should call out racism and do it sensibly. ""when it's in the public square, i think you should call out, you should frown against it and you should take action where it breaches the law, because it is cancerous, it's divisive and it undermines the values of our society,"" he added. on how the law deals with such incidents, mr shanmugam said there is a ""fairly strict framework"" in singapore, but the country has to go beyond that to maintain racial harmony. ""legal framework is one part of it, but the government and society have to work very hard to maintain harmony.  you can't bring about harmony and racial tolerance and acceptance just by having laws and enforcing them, you need to do much more,"" he said. ""the laws give the framework, the foundation, they are important, but you got to go beyond that.  and the answer is not every time something happens, you charge,"" he added. ""when it is serious, investigations are conducted, then the attorney general decides sometimes a warning, sometimes people are charged.  but you are careful in the way you exercise that power. ""although the government plays ""an extremely important role"" in safeguarding racial and religious harmony, singaporeans have a part to play as well, mr shanmugam said. ""it's not a subtraction from singaporeans to say, 'i'm an indian', 'i'm a chinese', 'i'm a malay', or sub-identities.  those are extremely important.  they give us our cultural ballast,"" he said. ""but beyond that, we are also singaporeans, and that is a common identity.  we have to emphasise that common identity, even as we recognise, accept, emphasise our individual identities.  we need to have that common vision to say, look, we want to build a system based on justice, equality, meritocracy, and where everyone can feel equal, and everyone can feel protected,"" he added. ""the government has a huge role in articulating that vision and being fair. ""need for deeper engagementin a facebook post earlier on thursday,president halimah yacob said that while singapore's primary recourse has been the law and that those found guilty have been ""rightly punished"", this will not stop hate and chauvinism from perpetuating. ""it is agonising to read about the incidents of hatred and chauvinism perpetrated by singaporeans against each other.  such displays are so hurtful because we thought that we had done so much to protect our cohesion until we are shaken from our belief,"" she said. ""our greatest fear is how such prejudice will affect our young and influence their minds.  we wonder whether these are one-off incidents or reflective of a larger problem. ""mdm halimah called for deeper engagements about why cohesion is important and what it means to be a truly multiracial and multi-religious society. ""we need this, as arguments such as the social media and the current pandemic as contributing factors, may mask the real issues,"" she said. ""in the meantime, let us start by being kinder to each other.  we can control how we want to respond and do so in a constructive and meaningful way.

racism exists, singapore has made ""tremendous progress"" in racial harmony over the years, said law and home affairs minister k shanmugam on thursday (jun 10) in an interview with cna938.', 'his comments follow recent incidents of alleged racism in public.', 'last week, a viral video emerged showing aman making racist remarkstowards an interracial couple at orchard road.', 'in another incident last month,a 55-year-old woman was allegedly kickedand subjected to racial slurs by a 30-year-old man while she was brisk walking.', 'when asked during the interview if singapore\'s racial harmony is on a knife-edge, mr shanmugam said: ""i\'ve always said there is racism in singapore, but we are a better society than most other multi-racial societies that i know of.', '""i mean, name me a society where there is no racism, which is multi-racial?', ""i've felt that we have made tremendous progress."", '""he added: ""most people accept the norms of a multiracial society and we are making progress.', 'the direction was positive and direction has been positive.', '""mr shanmugam had said last week following the incident at orchard road that he is ""not so sure anymore"" that singapore is ""moving in the right direction"" on racial tolerance.', '""it\'s the direction that i\'m concerned about,"" he added on thursday.', '""but as of today, i won\'t say we are at knife-edge.', 'i think that will be over-dramatising it.', '""mr shanmugam also said that people should call out racism and do it sensibly.', '""when it\'s in the public square, i think you should call out, you should frown against it and you should take action where it breaches the law, because it is cancerous, it\'s divisive and it undermines the values of our society,"" he added.', 'on how the law deals with such incidents, mr shanmugam said there is a ""fairly strict framework"" in singapore, but the country has to go beyond that to maintain racial harmony.', '""legal framework is one part of it, but the government and society have to work very hard to maintain harmony.', 'you can\'t bring about harmony and racial tolerance and acceptance just by having laws and enforcing them, you need to do much more,"" he said.', '""the laws give the framework, the foundation, they are important, but you got to go beyond that.', 'and the answer is not every time something happens, you charge,"" he added.', '""when it is serious, investigations are conducted, then the attorney general decides sometimes a warning, sometimes people are charged.', 'but you are careful in the way you exercise that power.', '""although the government plays ""an extremely important role"" in safeguarding racial and religious harmony, singaporeans have a part to play as well, mr shanmugam said.', '""it\'s not a subtraction from singaporeans to say, \'i\'m an indian\', \'i\'m a chinese\', \'i\'m a malay\', or sub-identities.', 'those are extremely important.', 'they give us our cultural ballast,"" he said.', '""but beyond that, we are also singaporeans, and that is a common identity.', 'we have to emphasise that common identity, even as we recognise, accept, emphasise our individual identities.', 'we need to have that common vision to say, look, we want to build a system based on justice, equality, meritocracy, and where everyone can feel equal, and everyone can feel protected,"" he added.', '""the government has a huge role in articulating that vision and being fair.', '""need for deeper engagementin a facebook post earlier on thursday,president halimah yacob said that while singapore\'s primary recourse has been the law and that those found guilty have been ""rightly punished"", this will not stop hate and chauvinism from perpetuating.', '""it is agonising to read about the incidents of hatred and chauvinism perpetrated by singaporeans against each other.', 'such displays are so hurtful because we thought that we had done so much to protect our cohesion until we are shaken from our belief,"" she said.', '""our greatest fear is how such prejudice will affect our young and influence their minds.', 'we wonder whether these are one-off incidents or reflective of a larger problem.', '""mdm halimah called for deeper engagements about why cohesion is important and what it means to be a truly multiracial and multi-religious society.', '""we need this, as arguments such as the social media and the current pandemic as contributing factors, may mask the real issues,"" she said.', '""in the meantime, let us start by being kinder to each other.', 'we can control how

2021-06-12,S$15 million support to help Changi Airport workers adjust to enhanced COVID-19 safety measures.,"jewel changi airport reopens to the public on jun 14, but passenger terminals remain closed to allow the airport community to adapt to new zoning measures and safety protocols. singapore: the civil aviation authority of singapore (caas) and the changi airport group (cag) will set aside s$15 million to help airport workers adjust to enhanced safety measures put in place after more than 100 covid-19 cases were linked to the airport last month. about 5,000 workers will benefit from the s$15 million, which will be used to provide a monthly special allowance and cater meals for workers for six months, as well as defray the cost of personal protective equipment, they said. last month changi airport became singapore's largest active covid-19 cluster, with more than 100 cases, with caas and cag saying at the time that preliminary investigations suggested that theinitial transmissioncould have occurred through an airport worker who was ""assisting a family from south asia"". subsequently changi airport's passenger terminals, as well as entertainment and retail complex jewel, were closed to the public, while additional covid-19 testing was introduced for arrivals from 'very high-risk' countries and regions. in a media release on friday (jun 11), caas and cag said there have not been any new covid-19 positive cases involving airport workers since may 20. ""of the 43 airport workers who had tested positive, 42 have been discharged and the remaining worker is recovering in a hospital general ward without oxygen supplementation,"" they said. they added that they have been working closely with the health ministry and the airport community to ""review and strengthen changi airport's defences against the more transmissible covid-19 variants"". enhanced safety measures have been implemented to protect airport workers, travellers and the public, they said. ""cohorting arrangements for airport workers have been tightened through a zonal system to reduce the risk of cross infection,"" they said. ""in particular, airport workers in the passenger terminal piers, arrival immigration halls and baggage claim halls who have interactions with arriving and transfer passengers and therefore are at higher risk of exposure to the virus, are now required to remain in their work zone throughout their shift, including during their meal and rest times,"" they said. these workers are also required to be in ""higher levels"" of ppe throughout the duration of their shifts, except for meal and rest times. deep cleaning and disinfection of changi airport's passenger terminal buildings and jewel changi airport have been completed, while anenhanced segregated zoning systemannounced last month has been implemented, said caas and cag. ""airport workers have been briefed and trained on the new measures and requirements, to allow the new measures and safety protocols to be implemented smoothly,"" they said, noting there would also be regular reminders, checks and audits on health safety as an ""added safeguard"". ""the safety of our airport workers remains our top priority.  we are therefore supportive of the tightened measures to ensure they are protected in the course of their work,"" said national trades union congress deputy secretary-general cham hui fong. ""our unions will continue to work closely with the relevant stakeholders to mitigate any impact on them, and to ensure their wellbeing is taken care of,"" she added. jewel to reopen on jun 14jewel, which has been closed to the public since may 13, will reopen on jun 14. changi airport's passenger terminals will remain closed to the public to allow the airport community to adapt to the new zoning measures, which require ""significant operational adjustments"", said caas and cag. more details on the reopening of the passenger terminals will be released at a later date, they said. since may 23, airport workers in higher risk roles have had to take an additional antigen rapid test (art) between their seven-day polymerase chain reaction-based rostered routine tests. cag and caas said that since jun 3, it has been testing the use of the traciex breathalyser, which allows workers to blow into a disposable breathalyser fitted with a proprietary sensor chip instead of undergoing an art. traciex was given provisional authorisation by the health sciences authority on may 27. ""the breathalyser will then be inserted into a portable reading device for vibrational spectroscopy analysis, which will be able to tell if a person is infected with covid-19 within two minutes,"" said cag and caas. this will allow workers to receive their results faster than with the current art, they said, adding that workers would also experience less discomfort as the test is non-invasive. ""we aim to progressively replace the art for more airport workers with the traciex breathalyser in the coming months.  this will also allow us to step up the frequency of testing so that we can more quickly detect, isolate and treat any potential covid-19 cases in the airport community,"" they said. transport minister s iswaran, who visited changi airport on friday, described the new breathalyser test as a ""potential game changer"" due to its method of administration. ""we will gradually be scaling up the use of this breathalyser to validate its efficacy, and to be able to then scale up its use for a much wider range of workers,"" he said, noting workers had told him the new test was a welcome alternative to the more invasive pcr and art tests. reopening travelwhen asked about comments made by south korean authorities that the country planned to expedite travel bubble plans with singapore, mr iswaran said singapore was ""engaging in dialogue with many potential partners"". to allow for cross-border travel, key elements such as mutual recognition of vaccinations and testing protocols need to be in place, he said. meanwhile the enhanced safety measures allow the airport to adapt more quickly to emerging risks, he said, describing these measures as an important part of singapore's ""overall posture towards a calibrated and safe reopening of travel"". ""once we have those elements in place then, at the appropriate time, when the ambient conditions are there, we can then activate that plan and mobilise the airlines and other partners to facilitate the kind of cross-border travel that we want to achieve.

2021-06-12,"Ex-students call out lecturer for offensive remarks in class, Latest Singapore News.","former students of ngee ann polytechnic engineering lecturer tan boon lee have accused him of racially and religiously insensitive behaviour in the classroom. one of them, ms nurul fatimah iskandar, 22, said in an instagram post on wednesday that mr tan had initiated an offensive discussion about islam during lesson time, when she was his student about four years ago. she told the straits times yesterday: ""he opened websites about islam and explained why he didn't agree with certain quranic verses. ""he then singled me out and tried to start a debate on the topic.  it didn't help that i was the only muslim student in class and i sat in the front row. ""asked about ms nurul's allegations, mr tan declined to comment ""at the moment"" but said he remembers her as a former student. the polytechnic told the straits times last night that it was aware of the allegations against mr tan and deeply regrets ms nurul's experience. it added that it has a zero-tolerance approach to any form of misconduct by members of its community. ""our staff members are expected to respect the cultural, ethnic and religious differences when interacting with students and other staff members,"" a spokesman for the poly said. second minister for education maliki osman also addressed ms nurul's post, saying he was ""shocked and disappointed"" to hear about mr tan sharing his ""personal and derogatory views on islam"". ""there is no place for any anti-ethnic and anti-religious remarks in our education institutions, and even more so from an educator,"" dr maliki said in a post on facebook last night. mr tan, 60, is assisting the police with investigations after he was filmed making racist remarks to ice cream store owner dave parkash, 26, and his girlfriend jacqueline ho, 27, a user experience designer, in orchard road last saturday night. the polytechnic has suspended him from teaching duties and is conducting an internal investigation after a video of the incident surfaced online on sunday. in its statement last night, the polytechnic added that it would not hesitate to take disciplinary actions against mr tan, including dismissal, if appropriate. ms nurul, who is now an electrical engineering student at the national university of singapore, said the incident involving mr tan happened in july 2017. she was a second-year electrical engineering student at the polytechnic at the time. ms nurul said it was tough for her to speak up against her lecturer as she was afraid her scholarship would be at stake if things went badly. ms nurul finally mustered the courage to send an e-mail to the school about what happened.  she never got a response, she said. since she put up the post about the incident on instagram, ms nurul said more accounts about mr tan from other students have come to her attention. one instagram user alleged that mr tan once made disparaging comments about christianity in class, causing outrage among students. another alleged that he had made her take off her hijab. national institute of education don jason tan said while it is important for teachers to be able to conduct discussions on difficult issues such as race and religion, they must do so with basic respect. ""the first step is for them to confront their own biases and prejudices,"" he said. ""what happens in classrooms shape students' values, attitudes and behaviours.

2021-06-12,G7 summit outlines health pact to stop future pandemics.,"carbis bay, united kingdom: g7 leaders are on saturday (jun 12) set to agree a joint declaration aimed at preventing another pandemic, as they resume wide-ranging talks at their first in-person summit in almost two years. the group of leading economies britain, canada, france, germany, italy, japan and the united states will also try to showcase western democratic cohesion against a resurgent china and recalcitrant russia. they will be joined by the leaders of australia, south africa and south korea, along with india taking part remotely, as the agenda broadens to foreign policy issues and climate change. the g7 is meeting face to face for the first time since 2019, at a beachside venue in cornwall, southwest england, after the coronavirus led to the cancellation of last year's summit. the leaders opened the three-day summit friday with expectations of a pledge to donate one billion vaccine doses to poor countries this year and next much too slow to end the crisis now, campaigners said. us president joe biden arrived with a message of solidarity and resolve in stark contrast to the isolationist stance of his predecessor donald trump. after the traditional family photo and opening session on ""building back better"" from covid-19, the leaders spent the evening at a reception hosted by queen elizabeth ii at cornwall's eden project. a renowned attraction showcasing the world's ecological riches, the site also hosted a g7 meeting with prince charles and 10 international business leaders to discuss ramping up sustainable growth. the g7 this weekend will also tackle climate change, and safeguarding global biodiversity, to lay the groundwork for the un's pivotal cop26 environmental summit in scotland in november. the leaders are debating a pledge to protect at least 30 per cent of the world's land and oceans by 2030. on saturday's foreign policy agenda, this year's coup in myanmar and crackdown on pro-democracy supporters in belarus are expected to figure, alongside tensions with russia and china. most of the leaders will reconvene on monday in brussels for a nato meeting, before biden heads on to his first summit with president vladimir putin in geneva, vowing to deliver a blunt message about russian behaviour. ""i'll tell you (about it) after i've delivered it,"" biden told reporters friday. the g7 is expected to finalise the ""carbis bay declaration"" comprising a series of commitments to prevent a repeat of the devastation wreaked by the coronavirus. ""for the first time today the world's leading democracies have come together to make sure that never again will we be caught unawares,"" british prime minister boris johnson said in remarks released ahead of the summit's second day. ""that means learning lessons from the last 18 months and doing it differently next time around. ""the declaration will be published sunday alongside the g7's final communique, following a beachside barbecue on saturday night. the collective steps include slashing the time taken to develop and licence vaccines, treatments and diagnostics for any future disease to under 100 days, while reinforcing global surveillance networks. the leaders will vow to boost genomic sequencing capacity, and support reforms to strengthen the world health organization (who), according to johnson's government, which like the us wants china to allow new access to who experts to determine how covid-19 first emerged. who chief tedros adhanom ghebreyesus, criticised in some quarters for being too accommodating of china, welcomed the health pact. and he said the un agency would examine a british proposal to create a ""global pandemic radar"" to send early warnings of future outbreaks. ""the world needs a stronger global surveillance system to detect new epidemic and pandemic risks,"" tedros said. the g7 leaders are also expected to outline more help for developing nations to build up infrastructure, as a counterpoint to the debt-fuelled spending by china in africa, asia and latin america. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-12,"Tennis: I'll remember this forever, says Djokovic after toppling Nadal in Paris.","paris: world number one novak djokovic said his win over rafa nadal in friday's epic french open semi-final was one of the top three matches he had played and he would remember it forever. the 34-year-old serb lost the opening five games but hit back in magnificent fashion towin 3-6 6-3 7-6(4) 6-2in front of a raucous court philippe chatrier crowd. he will now face greek stefanos tsitsipas in sunday's final, where he will seek a second french open title and a 19th grand slam title in total to move one behind the men's record haul held by nadal and roger federer. ""definitely the best match that i was part of at roland garros, and top three matches that i ever played in my entire career,"" djokovic told reporters after inflicting only a third ever french open defeat on 13-time champion nadal. ""considering the quality of tennis, playing my biggest rival on the court where he has had so much success and has been the dominant force in the last 15-plus years, and the atmosphere which was completely electric. ""one of these nights and matches you will remember forever. ""the omens did not look good for djokovic when he went 5-0 down in the first set despite playing well.  it had horrible similarities to last year's final which he lost to the spaniard 6-0 6-2 7-5, only this time he wrenched back control. ""the beginning of the match was kind of resembling last year's final,"" djokovic, who enjoyed loud support throughout the four-hour contest, said. ""i was not too nervous though even if i was 0-5 down because the feeling was different from last year's final, because i was just hitting the ball better and feeling better overall. ""i just kind of found my rhythm, found my groove.  there was no looking back.  even though i lost the first set, i found my game.  things started to work out really nicely. ""freshest guyeven for a man of djokovic's physical and mental resources, the emotions of friday's win might leave a hangover and he will be fully aware that the last time he beat nadal at the french open in 2015, he ended up losing the final to stan wawrinka. ""i'm not the freshest guy right now obviously.  but the good thing is that i have a day and a half to rejuvenate,"" he said. ""i'll enjoy this victory a little bit.  i think i deserve after this big win to just relax a little bit without thinking about the next opponent, even though it's a grand slam final. ""djokovic saved a set point at 5-6 in a pivotal third set full of spellbinding rallies before taking the tiebreak.  he then reeled off the last six games of the match to take his record over career-long rival nadal to 30-28. incredibly, djokovic is the first player in 116 matches to beat nadal in best-of-five sets on clay after losing the opener. asked what it meant to beat nadal at a grand slam he has owned almost exclusively since 2005, djokovic said it was difficult to put into words. ""i mean, he has been the most dominant player of the roland garros history.  he lost two, now three times, in his entire career here,"" world number one djokovic said. ""the amount of wins that he has made on this court isincredible.  each time you step on the court with him, youknow that you have to kind of climb mount everest to win. ""it's just one of these matches that i really will remember for a very long time, not just because i won the match but because of the atmosphere, the occasion was very special.

2021-06-12,4 COVID ART test kits on sale at 3 Singapore pharmacies from 16 June.,"singapore — four antigen rapid test (art) self-test kits will be available from 16 june at guardian, unity, and watsons retail pharmacies, the multi-ministry taskforce (mtf) on covid-19 said on thursday (10 june). the measure was unveiled by the mtf at a virtual media conference as it announced that singapore will gradually move back to phase 3 (heightened alert) in two steps, with one set of measures taking effect from 14 june and another from 21 june.  more of the self-test kits will be made available at more retail locations progressively. the self-test kits can produce results in less than 20 minutes, are simple to use and can be self-administered, the ministry of health (moh) said separately in a statement.  to ensure that there are adequate supplies, sales will be initially limited to 10 art kits per person, moh added. the four kits that have been granted interim authorisation for public sale by the health sciences authority (hsa) are 'abbott panbiotm covid-19 antigen self-test', 'quickvue at-home otc covid-19 test', 'sd biosensor sars-cov-2 antigen self-test nasal', and 'sd biosensor standard q covid-19 ag home test'. director of medical services kenneth mak told reporters that the art self-test kits complement singapore's overall surveillance strategy.  ""these fast and easy-to-use tests allow us to detect infected cases more quickly, in particular among individuals those who do not have acute respiratory infection symptoms, but are concerned that they may have been exposed to covid-19. ""individuals who have a positive result for their art self-test should immediately approach a swab and send home public health preparedness clinic (sash phpc) for a confirmatory polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test.  they are then required to self-isolate until they get a negative pcr test result.  those who test negative on their self-test art should continue to stay vigilant and adhere to prevailing safe management measures.  individuals who have ari symptoms should continue to visit a doctor for a full diagnosis and pcr test instead of relying on an art self-test kit. hsa said in a separate statement that arts have lower sensitivity than pcr tests and have a higher chance of false negative results.  ""incorrect sample preparation or testing process when using the test, or a low viral protein level in the user's nasal sample (e. g.  1-2 days from potential exposure), could also result in a false negative result.  anyone with acute respiratory infection symptoms should consult a doctor,"" hsa said. singapore is currently in phase 2 (heightened alert) reopening, which started on 16 may and will end on 13 june.  stay in the know on-the-go: join yahoo singapore's telegram channel at http://t. me/yahoosingaporeother stories:singaporean woman, 86, dies from covid-19; linked to ttsh clusterman who wanted to get married in china breached shn to appeal to icagurmit singh, actor in covid-19 jingle, fined $800 for speedingchina's quick rollout of a law against foreign sanctions has left european and american companies shocked and facing ""irreconcilable"" compliance issues, two top business groups said friday, despite beijing saying the move would unlikely impact investment. it is compulsory to have your car insured in singapore.  why not make the most of it by looking for the best car insurance plan in town when your policy is up for renewal? while it can be tempting to simply renew your existing car [. . . ] the post 5 best car insurance plans in singapore (2021) appeared first on singsaver blog we compare, you save. få flere penge i hverdagen ved at samle din gæld.  indsend en ansøgning her og få et tilbud.  indfri lånet når du ønsker det. agnes chow hails from a generation of hong kong democracy activists who cut their teeth in politics as teenagers and are now being steadily silenced by china. a top official from the chinese county that hosted a fatal ultramarathon last month has been found dead, authorities said friday, as 27 people face punishment over the incident. ion orchard will be closed to the public from saturday (12 june) for four days and reopen on 16 june after three cases working at the mall were found to have covid-19 infection. bedste sikkerhed i klassen.  a+ forbrug 19,2 km/l, 117-118 g/km co2.  prisen gælder indregistrering senest 30/06/2021. democrats erupted in outrage friday over news that donald trump's justice department secretly surveilled lawmakers probing possible collusion with russia, reaping the phone records of top political foes in what they called an unprecedented abuse of power. singapore will begin slowly easing a month-long partial lockdown from next week after the curbs succeeded in stemming a coronavirus outbreak, authorities said thursday. a hong kong court has barred media tycoon jimmy lai chee-ying and his companies from challenging the legality of the search warrants executed in a series of raids at his offices last year and refused their applications for an injunction against the police chief.  the nine plaintiffs first filed a series of private legal actions against the commissioner of police last year to recover some materials seized by officers during investigations into allegations of fraud and national security law violatibook en prøvetur og oplev ceed plug-in hybrid med plads til hele familien.  kør lydløst rundt på strøm i dagligdagen og mærk begejstringenbeijing has repeated an offer to vaccinate people from taiwan against covid-19, as the coronavirus continues to spread on the island.  the taiwan affairs office, beijing's main body for cross-strait affairs, on friday said that taiwanese who fly to mainland china can voluntarily receive covid-19 shots as long as they meet vaccination requirements and follow outbreak control measures.

""the prime ministers also discussed exploring a broader partnership on a green economy agreement to facilitate trade and investment in environmentally sustainable goods and services,"" mfa added. the ministry also said both countries will start discussions on a fintech bridge to enhance cooperation in fintech policy and regulation, which will build upon the high-level digital economy agreement that they made last year. this fintech bridge will look for opportunities for collaboration on joint innovation projects, as well as facilitate investments and new business opportunities in digital trade and financial services, said the two prime ministers. on the defence front, pm lee said at a joint news conference with mr morrison that the republic greatly appreciates australia's generous support for the singapore armed forces' training ""over many years, in many airbases and camps all over australia"". a new memorandum of understanding (mou) between the health ministries of the two countries was signed yesterday to enhance cooperation on healthcare and health technologies. the two countries have also agreed to ink an agreement on operational science and technology cooperation to develop and enhance capabilities for homeland security and law enforcement agencies to prevent crime and maintain law and order. an existing mou between the singapore symphony orchestra and melbourne symphony orchestra will be renewed as well. both leaders said that in an increasingly uncertain and complex strategic environment, australia and singapore are like-minded partners with a high degree of strategic trust.  they agreed to increase the frequency and complexity of professional exchanges, dialogues and training activities between the two countries. the two leaders also discussed regional developments yesterday, and both said a strong, cohesive and responsive asean is vital to the region's success and recovery. agreeing that asean could play an important role in facilitating a peaceful solution to the situation in myanmar, pm lee and mr morrison called for an immediate cessation of violence, the release of all political detainees there, including foreigners, and inclusive dialogue between all parties. both prime ministers also reaffirmed their shared commitment to maintaining and promoting peace, security and stability in the region, as well as to the peaceful resolution of disputes, including full respect for legal and diplomatic processes, without resorting to the threat or use of force, in accordance with international law. they underlined australia and singapore's strong support for freedom of navigation, overflight and unimpeded trade in the south china sea. ""they also emphasised the importance of non-militarisation of disputed features and self-restraint in the conduct of activities that would complicate or escalate disputes and affect peace and stability,"" said the joint statement. ""they urged all claimants to take meaningful steps to ease tensions and build trust, including through dialogue.

2021-06-12,"US, China clash as Biden debuts at G7.","washington: the united states and china clashed in rare talks on friday (jun 11) as president joe biden made his international debut at the group of seven (g7) summit, with his administration pressing beijing on covid-19, taiwan and human rights. secretary of state antony blinken, joining biden at the summit of industrial democracies in england, spoke by telephone with senior chinese official yang jiechi their first talks since a heated in-person encounter in alaska in march. as biden used his first presidential trip abroad to unveil a massive plan tobuy and distribute 500 million covid-19 vaccine dosesaround the world, blinken renewed us pressure on china over the origins of the pandemic that has killed more than 3. 7 million people. blinken ""stressed the importance of cooperation and transparency regarding the origin of the virus"", including allowing world health organization (who) experts back into china, state department spokesman ned price said in a statement. biden has ordered us intelligence to report back by late august whether covid-19, first detected in late 2019 in the city of wuhan, emerged from an animal source or a laboratory accident. former president donald trump trotted out the lab-leak theory but was widely dismissed, with many believing he was seeking to deflect criticism over his own handling of the pandemic, but biden has said there was aneed for further studyafter criticising beijing for not giving more access to a who probe. the laboratory theory has outraged china, which has sought to rebrand itself in the world's eyes not as the country that failed to stop the virus but as a model on how to contain it. ""interests of small circles""yang, a senior politburo member who has long taken a lead in beijing's handling of the united states, renewed denunciations of washington as biden met with leaders from other g7 nations britain, canada, france, germany, italy and japan. ""genuine multilateralism is not pseudo-multilateralism based on the interests of small circles,"" yang told blinken, according to state television. ""the only genuine multilateralism is that founded on the principles of the charter of the united nations and international law,"" yang said. yang also renewed accusations of us hypocrisy on human rights as blinken pressed on what the united states considers the genocide of uyghurs and other mostly muslim turkic people who are incarcerated in camps. ""the united states should resolve its own domestic serious human rights violations, and not use the so-called human rights issues as an excuse to arbitrarily interfere in the internal affairs of other countries,"" he said. yang made similar accusations about the united states in front of cameras during the meeting in anchorage, taking aback us officials who expected brief, civil remarks but raising his star power inside china. concern on taiwanblinken also voiced alarm at china's increasing pressure on taiwan including military flights off its coast. blinken ""called on beijing to cease its pressure campaign against taiwan and peacefully resolve cross-strait issues"", the state department statement said. washington has been increasingly alarmed that china will attempt to use force on taiwan, a self-governing democracy it considers part of its territory, after its sweeping curbs on freedoms in hong kong. the united states in recent days agreed toreopen trade talks with taiwanand authorised a military plane to bring a delegation of senators who offered covid-19 vaccines. amid wide bipartisan criticism of china, biden has largely continued the hawkish stance of trump, in substance if not in tone. the biden administration has described china as a preeminent international challenge and vowed to counter it by shoring up alliances and investing heavily in infrastructure and development at home. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-12,Football: Italy open Euro 2020 with 3-0 win over Turkey.,"rome: italy kicked off the european championship with a convincing 3-0 victory over turkey in group a at the olympic stadium on friday (jun 11) with ciro immobile and lorenzo insigne on target. roberto mancini's side had been frustrated by turkey's defensive approach in the first half but broke through in the 53rd minute when a hard-hit cross from domenico berardi flew in off turkey defender merih demiral for an own goal. the azzurri, now unbeaten in 28 matches, doubled their lead in the 66th when leonardo spinazzola's drive was parried by turkey goalkeeper ugurcan cakir but immobile reacted well to slot home the loose ball. insigne made it 3-0 in the 79th minute with a confident, curling finish after some sloppy defending from the disappointing turks. the win capped an emotional night in the italian capital which saw 16,000 fans return to the stadio olimpico. a spectacular sound and light show and fireworks preceded kick-off for the month-long 24-team event, which will be played across 11 countries having been delayed for a year because of the coronavirus pandemic. there was a performance by the italian national police orchestra, a parade of huge inflatable balloons on the pitch, tenor andrea bocelli sang 'nessun dorma' before a virtual performance from martin garrix, bono and the edge. former italy world cup winners alessandro nesta and francesco totti, who played for lazio and roma during their careers at the stadio olimpico, carried the ball to the centre of the pitch before kick-off. switzerland and wales face each in the group's second game in baku on saturday. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-12,Lobster fisherman survives being swallowed WHOLE by humpback whale for 30 seconds.,"by melissa koenig for dailymail. com and associated press  published:  21:03 bst, 11 june 2021   |  updated:  01:22 bst, 12 june 2021    266view  commentsa lobster diver was swallowed whole by a hungry humpback whale but lived to tell the tale because the creature didn't like how he tasted, and spat him back out. michael packard, 56, had been a commercial lobster diver out of provincetown, massachusetts for 40 years and was going on a routine lobster dive off the coast of cape cod last friday morning when he said he 'felt a huge bump and everything went dark. 'at first, he said he thought he had been attacked by a shark, but when he realized he did not feel any sharp teeth and was not in pain, he began to figure out what had happened. 'i realized, oh my god, i'm in a whale's mouth . . .  and he's trying to swallow me,' packard told wbz-tv following the encounter.  'and i thought to myself ok, this is it i'm finally i'm gonna die. 'packard, who is an experienced diver, started to think about his wife and his 12 and 15 year old sons, and began to struggle inside the beast's mouth until, he said, he saw a light and the whale started shaking his head side-to side. 'i just got thrown in the air and landed in the water,' packard recounted to the cbs affiliate.  'i was free and i just floated there.  i couldn't believe. . .  i'm here to tell it. '   he estimates he was in the whale's mouth for about 30 seconds, but continued to breathe because he still had his breathing apparatus in.  michael packard, 56, suffered only minor injuries after being trapped inside a humpback whale's mouth for roughly 30 seconds on friday morning. experts say being eaten by a humpback whale is extremely rare, with one suggesting the whale made a mistake when it sucked packard in and quickly spat him out (file photo)packard had been a lobster diver for 40 years at the time of the incident and was rescued by a crewmate who called authorities on the shorepackard took to facebook following the incident to thank the provincetown rescue squad for its 'caring and help'packard was rescued by his crewmate josiah mayo who was aboard their boat 'the j n' j. 'mayo watched in shock as the water beside the boat erupted as the whale surfaced and packard flew out of the mammal's mouth.  he plucked packard out of the water, according to the cape cod times, and used his radio to call authorities on the shore. the provincetown fire department later confirmed that a call came in about a diver who had suffered serious injuries to his legs 'after interacting with a whale. 'at first packard said, he thought he had broken his legs in the incident, but doctors later told he he just had soft tissue damage and bruises, and he was released from a local hospital later that day.  in a following facebook post, packard thanked the provincetown rescue squad for its 'caring and help' he said that when he was stuck inside the whale's mouth his thoughts turned to his wife and his 12 and 15 year old sons experts say it is extremely rare to be swallowed by a humpback whale, peter corkeron, a senior scientist at the new england aquarium estimating there is a one in 1 trillion chance someone would be eaten by a whale. when a humpback feeds, he said,  'they do what we call gulp feeding, and they an open their mouths up incredibly widely,' which jooke robbins, the director of humpback whales studies at the center for coastal studies, said could limit their forward vision. 'based on what was described, this would have to be a mistake, and an accident on the part of the humpback,' robbins concluded. 'he was just unlucky enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time,' corkeron conceded. the humpback likely hoped it would get a mouthful of sand lance fish, which live in the waters off cape cod. experts say whales are generally placid around humans, and show little aggression towards them. but they have warned divers to stay at least 100 feet away from the powerful animals at all times, because even an accidental brush with one can be very dangerous as packard discovered.

2021-06-12,Explainer: An eye for an eye? China's new anti-foreign sanctions law.,"by yew lun tianbeijing (reuters) china passed a wide-ranging law to counter foreign sanctions on thursday, in an apparent move to legalise its tit-for-tat retaliation against punitive actions taken by foreign countries over issues from human rights to hong kong. the law, effective immediately, builds upon previous administrative counter-measures against foreign sanctions issued by the chinese foreign and commerce ministries.  it also lays out the scope of china's counter-sanctions. who's the target?individuals or entities involved in the making or implementation of discriminatory measures against chinese citizens, or interfering with china's internal affairs could be put onto a blacklist, according to the full text of the law published on thursday. blacklisted individuals could find their relatives, and the organisations of which they are senior managers or have control over placed on the list. ""relevant departments"" in the chinese government can decide who to put on or remove from the blacklist. what happens to those blacklisted?those blacklisted could be denied entry into china or deported from china.  their assets within china can be sealed, seized or frozen. entities within china could be restricted from engaging in all forms of transactions or cooperation or other activities, potentially limiting the investment activities of blacklisted entities in china. chinese citizens or organisations can sue in chinese courts those who enforce foreign measures that discriminate against them. how is this different from the past?while the foreign ministry has previously announced sanctions mainly against individuals including western politicians and scholars, it had not cited a specific law as the legal basis. it was also not always clear what those sanctions entailed. although the commerce ministry has announced mechanisms targeted at foreign entities such as a so-called ""unreliable entity list"", there have been no known instances of companies being put on the list. the new law combines many features of these administrative orders by the foreign and commerce ministries, such as allowing chinese companies to sue for compensation and denying entry to blacklisted persons. beijing analysts say the new law makes china's sanctions appear less random, as it spells out who can be blacklisted and what the sanctions would entail. what do supporters say?state media and experts in china said the new law was a long overdue ""legal weapon"" needed to deter the west from interfering in china's internal affairs. all 14 vice-chairpersons of china's legislature who passed the law have been under u. s.  sanctions for passing the national security law last year that critics say has crippled political freedoms in hong kong. in other measures, the united states issued a ban on cotton and tomato imports from china's western xinjiang region in january, citing human rights violations and the use of forced labour in the region. wang jiangyu, a law professor at city university of hong kong, said the european union has a law the ""blocking statute"" to counter u. s.  sanctions, so china should not be faulted for having a similar law.

""the question of whether this can be 'overridden' in a case where an employee is deemed to provide essential services. . .  is important, as it affects a larger population of workers in general and not just the immediate plaintiff or parties to the case,"" justice lim said. a provision in the act allows an employer to require employees in essential services to work in excess of the prescribed limit of hours or to work on a rest day. the questions thus involve the interpretation of provisions in the employment act relating to whether a rest day can be scheduled such that an employee can be made to work for 12 consecutive days over a 14-day period, and whether bus drivers fall within the definition of employees providing ""essential services"". justice lim said there would be potential ramifications on how such employment contracts are structured in terms of granting days off, computing overtime pay and determining work hours. on sept 20, 2019, five bus drivers each filed a magistrate's court suit against sbs transit.  subsequently, eight others filed similar suits against sbs. all 13 plaintiffs are represented by lawyer m.  ravi. last year, the parties agreed for the suit relating to one plaintiff to be heard as a test case, to save time and money. this means the court's decision and findings on mr chua qwong meng's suit will be binding on all the plaintiffs. mr chua claims that sbs had breached the terms of his employment contract, which commenced on april 3, 2017, and the employment act. he alleged that sbs failed to give him a rest day each week. he also alleged that he was underpaid for overtime work which includes working on a rest day, for working beyond the prescribed hours and for working on a public holiday. sbs, which is represented by senior counsel davinder singh, denies his claims. it asserts that it has complied with its contractual obligations and the laws, rules or regulations pertaining to working hours, overtime pay and rest days. in particular, the law provides that an employee providing ""essential services"" may be required to exceed the prescribed work hours, and to work on a rest day. in march, mr chua filed an application to transfer the test case from the magistrate's court to the high court. mr ravi argued that the case should be transferred to the high court, as it involves an important question of law that has the potential to affect all classes of employees in singapore.  join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-12,Football: Revamped Italy show they can shine at Euro 2020.,"rome: italy will face stronger opposition than turkey at euro 2020 but a commanding3-0 win in the tournament's opening matchin front of their own fans on friday suggests the azzurri have all the ingredients to go far. the outcome was fitting reward for roberto mancini's side who stretched their unbeaten run to 28 games with an impressive performance while also keeping another clean sheet, their 12th in the last 13 games. mancini, who took over after italy failed to qualify for the 2018 world cup, has transformed a dull and predictable-looking side into a potent unit whose three-pronged attack thrives alongside a creative midfield and formidable defence. mancini has abandoned italy's conservative style of safety first and carved out an adventurous outfit whose approach based on crisp, one-touch passing secured 10 straight wins in qualifying, with 37 goals scored and four conceded. a 4-0 win over the czech republic in their final warm-up last sunday turned out to be a taste of what was to come at the olympic stadium as mancini fielded an unchanged team against the turks and his men delivered again. toothless turkey held on in the first half by defending with everyone behind the ball but the italians left the impression it was only a matter of time before the floodgates opened. domenico berardi was a threat on the right flank all evening and there was only going to be one outcome after merih demiral turned the forward's cross into his own net in the 53rd minute. with left back leonardo spinazzola doing damage on the other flank, turkey's defence, which conceded three goals in 10 qualifying games, looked all at sea and had no reply to italy's raids. ciro immobile got his reward with a typically opportunist goal to make it 2-0 in the 66th minute before lorenzo insigne put the icing on the cake in the 79th with a fine shot past helpless goalkeeper ugurcan cakir. at the other end, the long-serving central defensive duo of giorgio chiellini and leonardo bonucci looked as comfortable as ever in keeping turkey's top scorer burak yilmaz at bay and breaking out to feed the midfield. having scored three goals in one european championship match for the first time, italy's new-found confidence and commitment to attacking football looks likely to bear more fruit. they will head into their remaining group a matches against switzerland and wales at the same venue buoyed by a display which delighted the home fans who will crave more of the same. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-12,"High Court grants 13 SBS Transit bus drivers permission to transfer case from State Courts to High Court, based on important questions of law regarding Employment Act provisions.","the high court on thursday (10 june) gave permission to 13 sbs transit bus drivers to transfer their case from the state courts to the high court, based on important questions of law or public importance regarding the interpretation of certain employment act (ea) provisions relevant to their case. in the landmark decision, justice audrey lim said in a written judgement that the issues raised by the drivers met the first ground concerning important questions of law under section 54b of the state courts act (sca). an important question of law, as viewed within the ambit of section 54b of the sca, should concern ""more than the immediate interests of the parties"". it should ""be of some public importance, or a point of law which would affect other cases"", she added. however, such a question does not have to be ""a difficult or complex one, although it may be so in many instances"", said the judge. in the case of the 13 sbs transit bus drivers, questions of law that were raised were brought up in relation to the following ea provisions, among others:justice lim found that the above questions of law affect not only the 13 sbs transit bus drivers, but also ""a larger class of employees including those in the public transport sector who may potentially fall within the definition of employees"" under part iii of the criminal law (temporary provisions) act (cla). part iii of the cla encompasses employees ""in any industrial undertaking essential to the economy of singapore or any of the essential services"" listed under the provision, pursuant to section 38(2)(f) of the ea. the ea's provisions on mandated rest days and limits to hours of work, among others, serve as safeguards against the exploitation of the rights of employees, justice lim noted. ""the question of whether this can be ""overridden"" in a case where an employee is deemed to provide essential services, which on its face may not look like a difficult question, is important as it affects a larger population of workers in general and not just the immediate plaintiff or parties to the case,"" she reasoned. such a question, the judge elaborated, would have ""potential ramifications on how such contracts are structured in terms of granting off days, computing overtime pay and determining work hours"". ""this however, is not to be taken to mean that in every case in which a provision of the ea is engaged that it would thus constitute an important question of law,"" said justice lim. justice lim also touched on the issue of one of the drivers, chua qwong meng's action of urging his case to be made a 'test case'. while the sca does not provide a definition of a 'test case', the judge noted that both sbs transit and the drivers accept the definitions in black's law dictionary, which state that a 'test case' is:1.  a lawsuit brought to establish an important legal principle or right.  such an action is frequently brought by the parties' mutual consent on agreed facts – when that is so, a test case is also sometimes termed amicable action or amicable suit; or2.  an action selected from several suits that are based on the same facts and evidence, raise the same question of law, and have a common plaintiff or a common defendant.  sometimes, when all parties agree, the court orders a consolidation and all parties are bound by the decision in the test case.  – also termed test action. in the present case, the action brought by the sbs transit drivers to transfer the suit falls within the definition of a ""test case"", as it fits the second definition stated above, said justice lim. she also rejected sbs transit's submission that a test case should, on top of the second definition above, include case management ""or other concerns which would make the matter unsuitable for determination by the state courts"". referencing the australian case cited by sbs transit, justice lim said that unlike the relevant australian provisions that contain guidelines on the federal magistrates court's discretion to transfer proceedings to a higher court, there are no such requirements in section 54b(1) of the sca in singapore. ""i add that such matters may, however, constitute relevant considerations under the second stage of the inquiry pertaining to the exercise of the court's discretion whether to transfer even if one of the grounds in s. 54b(1) is made out,"" she added. human rights lawyer mr ravi of k.  k.  cheng law llc, who represents the drivers, dubbed the decision a ""ground-breaking"" one, as the high court ""acknowledged that there are important questions of law of public importance centring around the interpretation of provisions employment act"". such questions, he said, ""affect a larger class of employees and workers in general, and would have potential ramifications on how employment contracts are structured in terms of granting off days, computing overtime pay and determining work hours"". mr ravi also noted that he has decided to act for the drivers on a pro bono basis as they were ""not able to keep up with their installment payments"" for the ""small fee"" he had charged them. mr ravi's team comprises himself, as well as his knowledge manager guo rendi, senior law researcher gabriel rafferty, and paralegal sankari loganathan. ""at the same time during the pandemic came in more pro bono death penalty cases that needed urgent attention and sankari ably handled the families and distraught mothers with her kind demeanour,"" he said. ""on the sbs case , my entire team were and are committed to sacrificing the extra hours which has now paved way for the determination of the ambit of certain provisions of the employment act, like the meaning of"" rest days"","" overtime"" etc.  this case will effectively also determine the rights of about 6000 sbs drivers in singapore,"" mr ravi added. sbs transit is represented by a team of five lawyers from davinder singh chambers, led by senior counsel davinder singh. on 3 mar last year, five bus drivers argued that by failing to compensate its bus drivers at the basic hourly rate of pay for their waiting time between shifts, sbs transit had breached an implied term stated in their service agreement. the lawsuit arose after the two parties had failed to reach a settlement in their final mediation session between the first tranche of suits as reported in feb last year. in a statement of claim filed in the state courts that month, the bus drivers alleged that the company has breached several provisions under the ea — the statutory legislation upon which the terms and conditions pertaining to their working hours and overtime were based on. the bus drivers claimed that sbs transit had failed to compensate them at the basic hourly rate of pay ""for the period between 4 a. m.  to 5 a. m.  on the morning and split shifts"" in which the drivers are ""engaged to be waiting"", and ""between 9 a. m.  and 1 p. m.  on the split shift"". sbs transit, they added, had also failed to abide by clause 24(9) of the service agreement by not compensating them the agreed allowance of $18 for work done on the night shift. the company, they alleged, had also breached section 36(1) of the ea by failing to provide on a roster a weekly rest day. in addition, the company had violated section 37(3)(b) and section 37(3)(c) of the ea by not paying them ""the statutorily prescribed rate"" of a sum at the basic rate of pay for two days' worth of work, the bus drivers argued. by imposing a ""built-in overtime"" that resulted in the bus drivers working for longer than the statutorily prescribed daily work period of eight hours as well as 44 hours per week, sbs transit had also breached section 38(1) of the ea, according to the bus drivers. other breaches under the ea allegedly made by sbs transit, as claimed by the bus drivers, include compensating them at the normal hourly rate of pay — instead of the statutorily prescribed rate of an extra day's salary at the basic rate of pay for one day's work, in addition to the gross rate of pay for that day — for work done on public holidays. the five additional bus drivers bring the total number of bus drivers currently taking legal action against sbs transit to 13.  © 2006 2021 the online citizen© 2006 2021

agreement.', 'the lawsuit arose after the two parties had failed to reach a settlement in their final mediation session between the first tranche of suits as reported in feb last year.', 'in a statement of claim filed in the state courts that month, the bus drivers alleged that the company has breached several provisions under the ea — the statutory legislation upon which the terms and conditions pertaining to their working hours and overtime were based on.', 'the bus drivers claimed that sbs transit had failed to compensate them at the basic hourly rate of pay ""for the period between 4 a. m.  to 5 a. m.  on the morning and split shifts"" in which the drivers are ""engaged to be waiting"", and ""between 9 a. m.  and 1 p. m.  on the split shift"".', 'sbs transit, they added, had also failed to abide by clause 24(9) of the service agreement by not compensating them the agreed allowance of $18 for work done on the night shift.', 'the company, they alleged, had also breached section 36(1) of the ea by failing to provide on a roster a weekly rest day.', 'in addition, the company had violated section 37(3)(b) and section 37(3)(c) of the ea by not paying them ""the statutorily prescribed rate"" of a sum at the basic rate of pay for two days\' worth of work, the bus drivers argued.', 'by imposing a ""built-in overtime"" that resulted in the bus drivers working for longer than the statutorily prescribed daily work period of eight hours as well as 44 hours per week, sbs transit had also breached section 38(1) of the ea, according to the bus drivers.', ""other breaches under the ea allegedly made by sbs transit, as claimed by the bus drivers, include compensating them at the normal hourly rate of pay — instead of the statutorily prescribed rate of an extra day's salary at the basic rate of pay for one day's work, in addition to the gross rate of pay for that day — for work done on public holidays."", 'the five additional bus drivers bring the total

2021-06-12,"Japanese PM Suga refers to Taiwan as country, China hits back.","tokyo [japan], june 11 (ani): japanese prime minister yoshihide suga referred to taiwan as a country, drawing a sharp reaction from beijing which regards the self-ruled island as its 'inalienable part'. in his first one-on-one parliamentary debate with opposition leaders wednesday, suga, naming australia, new zealand and taiwan, said, ""such three countries have been imposing strong restrictions on privacy rights"" to curb the novel coronavirus outbreak, kyodo news reported. self-governed taiwan is usually called a ""region"" in japan. beijing claims full sovereignty over taiwan, a democracy of almost 24 million people located off the southeastern coast of mainland china, despite the fact that the two sides have been governed separately for more than seven decades. taipei, on the other hand, has countered the chinese aggression by increasing strategic ties with democracies including the us, which has been repeatedly opposed by beijing.  china has threatened that ""taiwan's independence"" means war. suga's reference came as tokyo and beijing have already been at odds over several issues, including a territorial dispute in the east china sea and the crackdown on hong kong. ""china expresses strong dissatisfaction with japan's erroneous remarks and has lodged a solemn protest against japan,"" foreign ministry spokesman wang wenbin told reporters in beijing on thursday. ""there is only one china in the world,"" wang said, urging japan to become more cautious in words and deeds on taiwan affairs and to avoid sending wrong signals to the island's independence forces. suga's government has been strengthening its commitment to democratic taiwan.  recently, japan donated over 1. 2 million covid-19 doses to taiwan, as the island faces a spike in covid-19 cases. china has also lambasted japan for donating vaccines, labelling such a move as a ""political performance"". at his summit in washington in april, suga with us president joe biden acknowledged ""the importance of peace and stability across the taiwan strait.

2021-06-12,"Singapore employers cannot require staff to disclose Covid-19 vaccination status unless necessary, Singapore News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore employers here have no legal power to force staff members to disclose their covid-19 vaccination status or demand that they get inoculated. experts and employers noted that while vaccination is strongly encouraged in singapore, it remains voluntary, although there are several ways people can be encouraged to get a jab. these will come more into focus as singapore begins rolling out covid-19 vaccinations to the wider population, with bookings open to singaporeans aged 12 to 39 from friday (june 11). singapore human resources institute (shri) president low peck kem told the straits times that unless there is a business need, employers should not compel staff to disclose if they have had a jab or take punitive action against those who do not get inoculated or refuse to update their vaccination status. ""even if there is a strong business need, such as needing to know in order to determine if the employee can travel for business or to deploy to higher-risk front-line facing roles, do explain clearly why the company needs to know the status and generally, most employees will comply,"" she said. institute for human resource professionals (ihrp) chief executive mayank parekh said that bosses should not use non-vaccination as a reason to terminate employment as there could be medical reasons for why a staff member did not get a shot. mr tan wei ming, senior associate at law firm cms holborn asia, said that if employers want to keep records on vaccinated employees that contain personal data such as names, they must do so in accordance with the personal data protection act and other applicable data protection laws. ""for these reasons, companies in singapore are unlikely to make their employees declare their vaccination status at this juncture,"" he added. wongpartnership joint head of employment practice jenny tsin said staff members should not face discrimination arising from their vaccination status, given that its voluntary. however, there could be circumstances that warrant a different approach, such as for jobs involving higher risk of exposure to covid-19, she added. in this instance, it could be more justified to limit return to the workplace to only vaccinated employees. investment bank goldman sachs recently ordered its employees in the united states to report their covid-19 vaccination status as part of their plans to return to the office, afp reported on thursday. st understands that goldman sachs is not requiring staff here to report their vaccination status, and that most are still working from home. while professional services firm ey strongly encourages its eligible staff to get vaccinated, it does not require them to declare their status given that immunisation is not mandatory, said the singapore and brunei managing partner max loh. uob human resources head dean tong said the bank has been encouraging staff in critical roles to get vaccinated since the government announced its roll-out to essential workers in the financial sector in march. st understands that uob does not track the vaccination status of employees. meanwhile, sembcorp industries has introduced an app that provides voluntary updates on a person's vaccination status. the app, which was developed in-house, is also used to obtain online approval for essential facility visits. an amazon spokesman said that the company's employees and associates are generally not required to declare their vaccination status, except for staff members who are travelling to singapore from overseas. the firm also provides a cash benefit to front-line employees and associates who are paid by the hour when they get their vaccination off-site. shri's ms low and mr parekh from ihrp said employers can encourage immunisation by communicating the benefits to their staff as well as incentivising vaccination through means such as time off after getting the jabs and giving workers a care package. mr samir bedi, asean workforce advisory leader at ey, noted that it would not be surprising to see employers including vaccination as a pre-requisite in job descriptions in future, particularly for front-line positions that require face-to-face interactions. ""this not only protects employees and their families, but also ensures the public's safety.  employees who travel for work may also need to comply with pre-travel vaccination travel regulations,"" he said. but companies must remain inclusive and consider the needs of individuals who may not be able to get vaccinated due to health reasons, mr bedi said. he added: ""this requires employers to continue with precautionary safe workplace measures while ensuring equal career opportunities for all.

""so everybody needs some encouragement, especially our front-liners who don't have the opportunity to work from home to stay safe,"" she said. ""their jobs and livelihoods are tied to what they do at the front line. ""ffa said it has pooled together $25,000 to fund the ez-link card distribution. the remaining $25,000 needed will come from temasek trust's oscar @ sg fund, which has agreed to match ffa's contribution on a dollar-for-dollar basis. caas director-general designate han kok juan said that the initiative complements the $15 million fund that the authority and changi airport group had set aside to help aviation workers. he praised the initiative as ""a great example of the strong community spirit"" at changi airport. members of the public who want to show support to aviation front-liners can submit messages of appreciation and encouragement by june 25.  the messages will be printed and given out together with the ez-link cards. submission details can be found on the friends for aviation instagram page. a post shared by friends for aviation (@friendsforaviation)join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

states secretary of state antony blinken in a phone call with china's top diplomat again voiced us concerns about the ""ongoing genocide and ethnic cleansing"" against muslim uigurs in china's far western region of xinjiang and ""the deterioration of democratic norms"" under china's rule in hong kong. secretary blinken spoke on friday with yang jiechi, the chinese communist party's top foreign affairs officer, to discuss a range of thorny issues confronting the two major powers including north korea's nuclear programme, a state department spokesman said. blinken's comments to yang follows the release on june 10 of a report by amnesty international showing xinjiang has become a ""dystopian hellscape"" where uighurs and other predominantly muslim ethnic minorities face systematic and state-organised ""mass internment and torture amounting to crimes against humanity"". blinken's conversation with yang further comes as challenges posed by china figure in discussions now under way among leaders of the group of seven industrialised democracies in the united kingdom and attended by president joe biden. china has cracked down on pro-democracy advocates in hong kong, a former british colony returned to chinese rule in 1997 under an agreed principle of ""one china, two systems"" that was to have allowed continuing democratic freedoms in hong kong. in addition to ""the need for the united states and the prc to work together for the denuclearization of the korean peninsula,"" blinken and yang discussed other ""shared global challenges"" including iran, myanmar and the climate crisis, state department spokesman ned price said in a statement. blinken called for more ""cooperation and transparency"" from chinese authorities in the world health organization's continuing inquiries into the origin of the covid-19 virus. on the call, yang expressed to blinken beijing's serious concern that some people in the us were spreading the ""absurd story"" about the coronavirus escaping from a wuhan laboratory, chinese state media said. beijing firmly opposed what yang called ""abominable actions"" over the pandemic, which he said were being used to slander china, state broadcaster cctv said, according to the reuters news service. the us's top diplomat called on beijing to ""cease its pressure campaign against taiwan and peacefully resolve cross-strait issues"", price said.  yang told blinken that washington should handle taiwan-related issues ""carefully and appropriately,"" cctv reported. washington should work with beijing to put ties ""back on track,"" yang said, according to cctv. the us and china have been engaged in an increasingly tense diplomatic exchange since blinken and yang met face-to-face in alaska in march.  at the time, the us expressed ""deep concerns"" about actions by china, and china pushed back as ""firmly opposed to us interference in china's internal affairs"". bonnie glaser, an asia expert at the german marshall fund think-tank, told reuters that although the agenda included potential areas of cooperation, the conversation appeared dominated by contentious issues. she said yang's call for washington to work with beijing to put ties ""back on track"" indicated that china was still putting the onus on the us for the problems in the relationship. notwithstanding the diplomatic tensions, china's largest ride-hailing company, didi chuxing, filed on thursday for an initial public offering of stock on us financial markets in what is expected to be the world's biggest ipo this year, reuters reported. the company is backed by asia's largest technology investment firms – softbank, alibaba and tencent.  sources familiar with the matter told reuters that it could raise around $10bn and seek a valuation of close to $100bn. at that valuation, didi's listing would be the biggest chinese share offering in the us since alibaba raised $25bn in 2014. activists arrested and as many as 7,000 police to be

2021-06-12,Man assaulted private hire car driver in road rage incident.,"singapore — upset at a private hire car driver who sounded his horn and made a gesture, a man drove quickly to catch up and confront him. marco paulo goncalves guimaraes, a 43-year-old portuguese, was jailed three weeks and fined $1,000 on thursday (10 june) after he pleaded guilty to one count of causing hurt to desmond wu weiming, and one count of not wearing a mask while arguing with wu. guimaraes was also ordered to pay compensation of $122. 20 to the private hire car driver by end july. a singapore permanent resident, guimaraes came to singapore in 2004 and founded football management international in 2010.  he began a career as a fifa licensed players' agent where he scouted for and helped to place promising players into european football clubs, according to his lawyer marshall lim from invictus law. guimaraes was actively scouting for talent in malaysia and singapore to bring to portugal to experience football, but the covid-19 pandemic dealt a severe blow to his work, said lim.  he is struggling to manage the business and his club algarve clube de futbol while supporting his wife and his two daughters, lim said. on 11 june last year, guimaraes was on his way to pick up one of his daughters from school when he got into the road rage incident.  his wife was beside him in the front passenger seat. at about 1. 10pm, wu was driving along punggol drive, a two-lane road, when guimaraes overtook him.  guimaraes' car appeared to brake abruptly. when wu passed by guimaraes' car, wu sounded his horn and gestured at him.  guimaraes drove quickly to catch up with wu and both cars stopped side-by-side at a loading bay at block 670a edgefield plains. guimaraes alighted and approached wu's car while not wearing a mask.  singapore was in phase 1 of its reopening then and all were required to wear their masks in public spaces with some exceptions. the portuguese then pushed the car door against wu, causing it to hit wu's right shin.  he then grabbed wu's right wrist and began arguing with him. after wu emerged from his car, guimaraes pushed him while hurling profanities at him.  wu recorded guimaraes with his mobile phone, and the latter then wore a mask. guimaraes then slapped wu on the side of his head and pushed his right arm.  he returned to his car and drove to a parking lot at a nearby loading bay, while wu called the police. wu parked his car behind guimaraes' and both alighted, with guimaraes kicking wu on his left shin. wu sought medical treatment at a hospital and was diagnosed with bruises and swelling over both shins, and over his left ear. according to lim, guimaraes had been driving cautiously due to heavy traffic and had not been able to filter to the left lane as it was full of vehicles.  this was when wu had sounded his horn at guimaraes.  when guimaraes managed to filter left, wu ""inexplicably sounded his vehicle horn at our client, despite our client having already gotten out of mr wu's way"", said lim. ""our client instructs that as mr wu drove past, he raised his hand, and our client perceived that mr wu had pointed his middle finger at him as he drove past.  this was unwarranted conduct from mr wu, bearing in mind that our client had given way to mr wu, and did not respond to mr wu's sounding of his horn at our client as he cautiously navigated edgefield plains. asking for two weeks' jail and a fine of $800, lim said, ""our client therefore could not fathom what caused mr.  wu to act in such a rude manner.

2021-06-12,Biden says biggest vaccine donation 'supercharges' battle against COVID-19.,"carbis bay, england: us president joe biden said on thursday (jun 10) that adonation of 500 million doses of the pfizer covid-19 vaccineto the world's poorest countries would supercharge the battle with the virus and comes with ""no strings attached"". biden, speaking alongside pfizer chief executive albert bourla in the english seaside resort of carbis bay ahead of a g7 summit, thanked other leaders for recognising their responsibility to vaccinate the world. ""the united states is providing these half billion doses with no strings attached.  no strings attached,"" biden said.  ""our vaccine donations don't include pressure for favours, or potential concessions.  we're doing this to save lives. ""biden, keen to burnish his multilateral credentials on his first foreign trip as leader, cast the donation as a bold move that showed america recognised its responsibility to the world and to its own citizens. ""america will be the arsenal of vaccines in our fight against covid-19, just as america was the arsenal of democracy during world war two,"" biden said. the largest ever vaccine donation by a single country will cost the united states us$3. 5 billion but willspur further donations from other g7 leaders- including british prime minister boris johnson. g7 leaders want to vaccinate the world by the end of 2022 to try to halt the covid-19 pandemic that has killed more than 3. 9 million people, devastated the global economy and upended the normal lives of billions of people. vaccination efforts so far are heavily correlated with wealth: the united states, europe, israel and bahrain are far ahead of other countries.  a total of 2. 2 billion people have been vaccinated so far out of a world population of nearly 8 billion, based on johns hopkins university data. 'save lives'us drugmaker pfizer and its german partner biontech have agreed to supply the us with the vaccines, delivering 200 million doses in 2021 and 300 million doses in the first half of 2022. the shots, which will be produced at pfizer's us sites, will be supplied at a not-for-profit price.  around 100 countries will get the shots. pfizer ceo bourla said the eyes of the world were on the leaders of rich nations to see if they would act to solve the covid-19 crisis and share with poorer nations. ""this announcement with the us government gets us closer to our goal and significantly enhances our ability to save even more lives across the globe,"" he said. while such a large donation of vaccines was welcomed by many, there were immediately calls for the richest nations of the world to open up more of their giant hoards of vaccines. anti-poverty campaign group oxfam called for more to be done to increase global production of vaccines. ""surely, these 500 million vaccine doses are welcome as they will help more than 250 million people, but that's still a drop in the bucket compared to the need across the world,"" said niko lusiani, oxfam america's vaccine lead. ""we need a transformation toward more distributed vaccine manufacturing so that qualified producers worldwide can produce billions more low-cost doses on their own terms, without intellectual property constraints,"" he said in a statement. another issue, especially in some poor countries, is the infrastructure for transporting the vaccines which often have to be stored at very cold temperatures. ip waiverbiden has also backed calls for awaiver of some vaccine intellectual property rightsbut there is no international consensus yet on how to proceed. the new vaccine donations come on top of 80 million doses washington has already pledged to donate by the end of june.  there is also us$2 billion in funding earmarked for the covax programme led by the world health organization (who) and the global alliance for vaccines and immunization (gavi), the white house said. gavi and the who welcomed the initiative. washington is also taking steps to support local production of covid-19 vaccines in other countries, including through its quad initiative with japan, india and australia. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

                the man fled to malaysia through the woodlands checkpoint sometime in october 1999, with the help of a friend.  the straits times/annsingapore, june 11 (the straits times/ann): a man who was on the run from the law for 20 years was sentenced on friday to an additional six months in jail for misleading an immigration officer and for missing a court hearing in 2000. siva kumar ramachandram, 46, fled to malaysia after being convicted here of smuggling illegal immigrants out through the woodlands checkpoint, the corrupt practices investigation bureau (cpib) said on friday (june 11). he had been sentenced to five years in jail and 12 strokes of the cane on sept 24, 1999. but siva fled the country sometime in october 1999, with the help of a friend known only as ""boy"". at the woodlands checkpoint, siva, a malaysian, used an unidentified person's passport to cross into malaysia. he was on court bail at the time, and missed his magistrate's appeal hearing on march 9, 2000, at the high court of singapore. a warrant for his arrest was issued that day, said cpib. he was arrested by the cpib on march 4, 2020, with the help of the malaysian anti-corruption commission. on april 16, 2021, siva was charged with offences under the immigration act and penal code. he will serve the six-month jail term after completing his initial five-year sentence. siva was given the five-year sentence after he was found guilty of a conspiracy that involved bribing a cisco officer to allow buses to transport illegal immigrants from singapore into malaysia through the woodlands checkpoint. the cisco officer was sentenced to one year in jail and fined $2, 800 in 1999. cpib said that singapore adopts a strict zero-tolerance approach to corruption.  the straits times/ann

2021-06-12,Watch Video: Chinese Woman Misbehaves With Indian Singaporean While He Prays.,"it's a matter of great concern as cases of racial discrimination and intolerance continue to rise.  in another shocking incident, an indian-singaporean took to facebook to share how his chinese-singaporean neighbour misbehaved while he was praying. this incident follows just days after a chinese man was caught on camera making derogatory remarks towards an interracial couple. screengrab: facebookindian-singaporean, livanesh ramu, shared a video of the incident on facebook and described what transpired. in the video– which has now been shared by 1. 7k users– he can be seen using a handheld prayer bell.  but just as he steps out for prayer, his chinese neighbour barges into the frame and disturbs ramu's prayer by loudly beating a dong. in his post, ramu described, ""like many other hindus, this has been a part of our family's 5-minute, twice a week prayer routine.  having lived in this home for more than 20 years we never had any issues.  i guess with covid we have a new norm. ""soon after posting the video, he received several supportive messages from singaporeans, most of whom lauded him for his calmness.  while others pointed that the lady was a minority in the largely racially equitable island nation. screengrab: facebookone user wrote, ""this is disrespectful and downright shameful on that lady.  and the look on her face!!!! epic""another user wondered why people have become far less considerate today.  she questioned, ""i have a neighbour like u also indian. . .  it's normal. . .  it's their ritual n religion. . not so loud they ring the bell.  is juz less than 8mins then they are done. . y can't the lady be more considerate?""thankfully, the video managed to reach the police just in time, who intervened and are now working with ramu to sort the matter.  as he later added to his post, ""the singapore police force has reached out to us.  we are coordinating with them at the moment. ""while this incident has shed light on the menace of racism in singapore, it is not the reality of this progressive island nation. most singaporeans, especially young parents, are raising their children to become more educated on such subjects and of course, open to all belief systems and cultures. as roshni mahtani cheung, group ceo & founder, theasianparent, puts it, ""i am not sure what triggered the woman to act out in such a manner – but as a country, we singaporeans need to be more tolerant and not get so agitated by small things. """"for those of us who are parents, we need to check our own behaviour.  ask ourselves if we are doing enough to expose our child to different cultures, religions and belief systems,"" adds the young mum. not just local singaporeans, but expats in singapore also believe that this is a one off incident and doesn't reflect singapore's inclusivity. ""i have never faced any such issues.  in fact, i have always been welcomed and felt safe being in singapore.  the current issues are one of cases.  it doesn't represent the community here and i am fortunate to be allowed to stay in this country with my family,"" shared vineeth kallarakkal, head of marketing, theasianparent.  kallarakkal has been living in singapore for eight years now and is originally from india. although this unfortunate incident has highlighted the need for more awareness, we cannot overlook the promptness of singapore police force that further proves the sanctity of racism laws in singapore. from the penal code to the protection from harassment act, singapore has a range of laws to guard citizens against racism.  in fact, these laws can also be invoked even if there was no intention to hurt racial or religious feelings. the laws apply to comments made online and also when a non-verbal gesture was made in public. according to the straits times report, lawyers note that other than racial enmity laws, authorities can investigate such actions under the protection from harassment act and the sedition act.  there are also other provisions in the penal code which may apply, such as public nuisance. these rules are proof that those who harass fellow citizens not only take the law into their own hands but also instil fear. so the best possible solution to this issue is that we must teach ourselves and our future generations to spread love and not hatred.  let's make this a safer place for everybody and continue to live in harmony. racism in singapore: interracial couple abused by chinese singaporean man, police probe onteach your kids to say no to racism – bring them up colour blind!the post watch video: chinese woman misbehaves with indian singaporean while he prays appeared first on theasianparent your guide to pregnancy, baby & raising kids. agnes chow hails from a generation of hong kong democracy activists who cut their teeth in politics as teenagers and are now being steadily silenced by china. china's quick rollout of a law against foreign sanctions has left european and american companies shocked and facing ""irreconcilable"" compliance issues, two top business groups said friday, despite beijing saying the move would unlikely impact investment. få flere penge i hverdagen ved at samle din gæld.  indsend en ansøgning her og få et tilbud.  indfri lånet når du ønsker det. it is compulsory to have your car insured in singapore.  why not make the most of it by looking for the best car insurance plan in town when your policy is up for renewal?

""i am confident singaporeans will be able to travel to australia too. ""mr sun yuchen, 23, a third-year student at the university of melbourne who is currently on a year's leave of absence, is looking forward to returning to campus.  ""i see a chance for me to return to australia to complete my studies and gain experience by using actual facilities the school provides,"" he said. singaporeans who are currently in australia, such as university of new south wales student joseph tan, look forward to reuniting with family here. the 23-year-old, who has been in australia since february last year, said he had been unable to return home, as his degree in aviation requires him to attend flying lessons there. he added: ""the travel bubble between singapore and australia comes as a relief to me as i have the opportunity to finally return home and see my family after being away for so long.  even if i can only return for a few days, it is comforting to return home again. ""students who returned to singapore when the covid-19 pandemic worsened said the past year had been tough for them. psychology student audrey chan, 23, is a final-year student at the university of queensland.  she has been continuing her classes remotely since returning to singapore in march last year. she said: ""my singaporean and malaysian peers agree that we often feel like an outsider or a cctv spying on the class via zoom, and this makes class participation painfully awkward and hard for us.  some of us are stressed out, as we find it hard to keep up with the class, especially when technology fails us. ""university of adelaide student shalynn tsai, 21, who is doing her bachelor's degree in dental surgery, had to take leave of absence because she was unable to return to campus by mid-september last year. ""it has been very stressful not knowing when or whether we can even continue with our degree courses,"" she said. ""with the travel bubble, we can finally go back and resume our studies. ""while the students understand that they may need to undergo pre-departure and arrival tests for the coronavirus, they hoped they would not have to incur hefty charges and would not have to be quarantined if already vaccinated. mr ryan soh, 21, will be commencing his communication studies at queensland university of technology later this month.  ""i hope that there will be no need for a quarantine once vaccination has been done and the covid-19 test comes back negative.  kind of like what's going on between new zealand and australia,"" he said. ""nevertheless, if there is a need for quarantine, then hopefully it would be more accessible or cheaper for students, as some of us may not be able to afford it. ""mr tan felt the same.  ""hopefully it will not be too expensive and there will not be a need to self-quarantine for too long once i arrive at either destination.  i understand the need for the covid-19 tests to ensure there are no imported cases and hope that both countries can maintain the safety of not only its residents but those travelling as well,"" he said. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-12,Foreign businesses shocked by rollout of China's anti-sanctions law.,"china's quick rollout of a law against foreign sanctions has left european and american companies shocked and facing ""irreconcilable"" compliance issues, two top business groups said friday, despite beijing saying the move would unlikely impact investment. the law came into effect on thursday, adding to china's toolbox as it builds its defences against us and eu pressure over trade and human rights. the move also came just a week after us president joe biden expanded a blacklist of chinese companies in which americans are not allowed to invest -- allowing beijing to now hit back at those who formulate or comply with foreign sanctions. ""european companies in china are shocked by the lack of transparency and speed of this process,"" european chamber president joerg wuttke told afp, referring to the passing of the new law. with the fresh rules prohibiting organisations from implementing what beijing deems discriminatory and restrictive measures, ""foreign firms remain very much stuck between a rock and a hard place,"" he said. american chamber of commerce chairman greg gilligan cautioned that the new law ""presents potentially irreconcilable compliance problems for foreign companies"". rushing through a new law without an opportunity for public comment severely jeopardises foreign investor confidence in china's legal system as well, he added. but chinese foreign ministry spokesman wang wenbin told a regular press briefing on friday he did not see a definite link between the new law and foreign investment. ""if anything, the enactment of the anti-foreign sanctions law provides a predictable legal environment. . .  for foreign companies operating in china,"" he said. wuttke, however, warned that the action was not conducive to attracting investment, or in reassuring companies that ""already feel they may be used as sacrificial pawns in a game of political chess"". ""there is a real concern that this will further destabilise eu-china relations,"" he said. in the european chamber's latest business confidence survey released this week, 41 per cent of respondents said china's business environment had become more politicised last year. most reported they expect the situation to remain the same or deteriorate over the coming year. bys-ehl/jfxagnes chow hails from a generation of hong kong democracy activists who cut their teeth in politics as teenagers and are now being steadily silenced by china. it is compulsory to have your car insured in singapore.  why not make the most of it by looking for the best car insurance plan in town when your policy is up for renewal? while it can be tempting to simply renew your existing car [. . . ] the post 5 best car insurance plans in singapore (2021) appeared first on singsaver blog we compare, you save. få flere penge i hverdagen ved at samle din gæld.  indsend en ansøgning her og få et tilbud.  indfri lånet når du ønsker det. democrats erupted in outrage friday over news that donald trump's justice department secretly surveilled lawmakers probing possible collusion with russia, reaping the phone records of top political foes in what they called an unprecedented abuse of power. ion orchard will be closed to the public from saturday (12 june) for four days and reopen on 16 june after three cases working at the mall were found to have covid-19 infection. china's rocket force has conducted firing exercises involving ""carrier killer"" df-26 ballistic missiles.  a missile brigade under the people's liberation army rocket force recently held launch practice in an unspecified training field at night to improve its combat ability, china national radio reported on tuesday.  in the exercise, the brigade practised the fast transfer of missiles to another location to launch a second wave of missiles, a drill to train the brigade's fast-response capabilities,lige nu kan du prøve aktiviva med en introrabat på 50% på første pakke, hvis du tilmelder dig abonnementsordningen – efterfølgende sparer du 20%a hong kong court has barred media tycoon jimmy lai chee-ying and his companies from challenging the legality of the search warrants executed in a series of raids at his offices last year and refused their applications for an injunction against the police chief.  the nine plaintiffs first filed a series of private legal actions against the commissioner of police last year to recover some materials seized by officers during investigations into allegations of fraud and national security law violatisingapore will begin slowly easing a month-long partial lockdown from next week after the curbs succeeded in stemming a coronavirus outbreak, authorities said thursday. president vladimir putin on friday denied a us media report that russia is set to deliver an advanced satellite system to iran that will vastly improve its spying capabilities. book en prøvetur og oplev ceed plug-in hybrid med plads til hele familien.  kør lydløst rundt på strøm i dagligdagen og mærk begejstringena top official from the chinese county that hosted a fatal ultramarathon last month has been found dead, authorities said friday, as 27 people face punishment over the incident. beijing has repeated an offer to vaccinate people from taiwan against covid-19, as the coronavirus continues to spread on the island.  the taiwan affairs office, beijing's main body for cross-strait affairs, on friday said that taiwanese who fly to mainland china can voluntarily receive covid-19 shots as long as they meet vaccination requirements and follow outbreak control measures.

""now we don't have to juggle such small numbers.  we can carry out lessons with four swimmers to one coach.  that ratio is a huge difference to us because when it's one-to-one, we're definitely losing money. ""the multi-ministry task force on thursday had indicated that mass participatory sports events such as runs could also be allowed to resume from june 21, with a maximum of 250 participants if pre-event testing is implemented. if participants are not tested before the event, only 50 people will be allowed to take part. national agency sportsg's latest update permitting sports competitions as long as different sessions are adequately separated within a day or across multiple days to avoid congregation was welcomed by organisers like lld sports development and management founder lyn yeo. her company is hoping to get approval for the cartimes singapore junior development tour championship.  the golf event at laguna national was postponed from its original may 31-june 2 date. she said: ""june is typically the busiest tournament season for junior golfers and we are hoping with great excitement that we are able to resume. ""some measures that organisers plan to have in place include temperature screening and safe entry protocols, as well as restricting each flight to two buggies, which have been installed with a full partition. players and officials will also be required to wear masks throughout their rounds. for gyms and fitness studios, many of whom are closed due to current restrictions, they will be allowed to restart operations from june 21. staff from these places where clients are unmasked will be required to undergo regular covid-19 testing, which is part of the regular fast and easy testing regimen for staff involved in ""higher-risk mask-off"" activities.  this will be introduced in july to reduce transmission during phase three (heightened alert). sportsg also announced that the occupancy limit for sport and recreational facilities will be increased to one person per 10 sq m from one person per 16 sq m, capped at 50 people. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-12,Ex-bus driver's lawsuit against SBS Transit for unfair work practices to be heard in High Court.,"singapore: a judge has granted a bid by a former bus driver to have his case against sbs transit for allegedly unfair work practices – including long work hours and unpaid overtime – heard in the high court. justice audrey lim said in a written judgment released on thursday (jun 10) that the case raises important questions of law to warrant the move to the higher court from the magistrate's courts. although the case was mounted by one bus driver, mr chua qwong meng, another 12 drivers are linked to it.  mr chua claims that about s$720,000 is involved in the allegations of all 13 suits, which include unpaid overtime fees and contentions on the maximum consecutive number of work days allowed. the case affects not only the bus driver in the case but a larger class of employees including those in the public transport sector, said the judge. lawyer m ravi represented mr chua and the other 12 bus drivers, while sbs transit was represented by a team of lawyers led by senior counsel davinder singh. mr chua worked for sbs transit from april 2017 to early 2020.  he commenced his suit against the company for breaches of contract and provisions of the employment act on sep 20, 2019. four other bus drivers commenced similar proceedings in the magistrates' courts that same day, and another eight drivers launched their own suits subsequently. in total, 13 bus drivers are suing sbs transit over what the judge said are essentially the same matters pertaining to their employment. they are: mr chua, mr lee chye chong, mr chian poh seng, mr fung chean seng, mr tan ting hock robin, mr thiyagu balan, mr gan kim kiam, mr huzainal hussein, mr lim you onn, mr chiew yi yee, mr meerah mohamed halideen, mr razak hasim and mr mohamad sani din. it was agreed on mar 4 last year that mr chua's case would be heard as a test case, with the other 12 suits held in abeyance pending the determination of his case. mr chua's claimsmr chua claims that sbs transit breached the employment act by not giving him a rest day per week.  its employment practices were also allegedly in breach of the manpower ministry's regulated pay rate that an employer is expected to pay for work done during a rest day. mr chua also claims that he was underpaid for overtime work, and that the company did not pay him the statutorily prescribed rate for working on a rest day. as a result, he worked in excess of the prescribed work hours in a day or week.  he also claims that the company did not pay him an agreed allowance for work done on the night shift. sbs transit denies the claims and asserts that it has complied with contractual obligations and laws, rules or regulations on working hours, overtime pay and rest days. it claims that it compensated mr chua in compliance with his employment contract, which started in 2017, as well as with the law and the manpower ministry's guidelines. mr ravi's arguments, and mr davinder singh'smr ravi argued for the case to be transferred to the high court as it involves an important question of law and is a test case. he said the questions of law which include how ""rest days"" are interpreted and whether an employee can work for 12 consecutive days over a 14-day period will impact not only the plaintiffs but the whole of the employment sector in singapore. the 13 suits amount to s$720,000, which is beyond the district court's limit, he said. mr singh objected to having the case heard in the high court, claiming abuse of court process and saying there is no important question of law. he said there is nothing to suggest that the issues raise difficult or complex issues.  the state courts regularly deal with disputes involving the interpretation of employment agreements and the provisions of the employment act, he added. he said mr chua has not shown credible evidence that damages in his suit would exceed s$250,000, the jurisdictional limit of the district court. justice lim said an important question of law need not necessarily be a complex or difficult one, and that just because the state courts deal with employment disputes does not mean there may not be important questions of law in the provisions of the employment act. she found that the questions of law in this case are important ones which affect a larger class of employees, pointing to how 12 other drivers filed similar suits. ""the employment act provides for mandated rest days and limits to hours of work (among other matters) to protect the rights of employees,"" she said. ""the question of whether this can be 'overridden' in a case where an employee is deemed to provide essential services, which on its face may not look like a difficult question, is important as it affects a larger population of workers in general,"" the judge said. the case would have potential ramifications on how such contracts are structured in terms of granting days off, computing overtime pay and determining work hours, she added. in a statement, sbs transit said it respects justice lim's decision and ""will continue to vigorously contest the bus captains' claims in the high court"". the case will be heard at a later date. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-12,IN FOCUS: How Johor’s residential property market has been hit hard by COVID-19.,"the johor skyline is now dotted with empty condominium units, due to an oversupply in the market and lack of foreign buyers. johor bahru: when singapore business owner jonathan gan purchased a 4-room condominium at lovell country garden in 2018, he thought he had clinched his dream retirement home. the freehold apartment located near johor bahru's city centre was twice the size of his 3-room hdb flat in singapore, but the cost was only half of the latter when he bought it directly from the developers. ""the best thing about the unit is the amazing view.  you never get anything close to it at such value in singapore,"" added the 42-year-old, who lives with his wife and two daughters. the apartment, like most units in the lovell development, overlooks the straits of johor.  the balcony opens up to a picturesque sea view and there is a sandy beach below. ""it was the ideal weekend home,"" said gan.  ""but now it's becoming a bugbear. ""just three years after he purchased it, gan who bought the unit at around rm1 million (us$242,000) is having a hard time trying to sell it, even though the asking price is a fraction of what he paid for it. since the covid-19 pandemic hit last year, border closures between singapore and malaysia meant that he and his family could not visit his weekend home. furthermore, gan's business in singapore has been affected by the pandemic, and he now needs to sell the apartment to gain some liquidity. ""all this was never part of the plan.  but the house is just left there, collecting dust and its value is going down by the day.  we felt it is better to cut our losses and try to get rid of it,"" he told cna. despite being on the market for over a year, there have been no takers.  he has engaged agents and even advertised the unit on various property portals but to no avail. ""there is not much hope.  barely anyone has viewed or signalled interest,"" he said. gan is among property owners in johor bahru who are having issues trying to sell their properties, as the market is in the doldrums due to the prolonged effects of covid-19. condominium developments around johor bahru were built with foreign buyers in mind, but the pandemic has closed borders, leaving many of them empty.  units owned by those from china, singapore, hong kong have been left unoccupiedwhile homes that were left unsold have stayed empty.  landed property is also facing potential depreciation. johor's oversupply problemaccording to statistics compiled by property consultancy firm henry butcher, the value and volume of residential property transactions in johor had been climbing ""rather steadily"" from 2017 until 2019. in its report on the outlook of the malaysian property market in 2021, the firm noted that the volume of transactions rose 8 per cent in 2018 and 7. 5 per cent in 2019, while the value of the transactions increased by 1. 5 per cent in 2018 and 15. 9 per cent in 2019. the report highlighted that the movement control order (mco) imposed by the malaysian government from mar 18, 2020 was a key reason that reversed the upward trend. it said that in the first nine months of 2020, the volume and value of transactions declined by almost a quarter compared to the same period in 2019. property analyst debbie choy, who is director of knight frank malaysia's johor branch, said the situation is particularly bad for condominiums and serviced apartments, of which there is an oversupply in the iskandar region. ""many developments were targeting a large proportion of overseas buyers.  with the prolonged effects of covid-19 restricting movements, it has been challenging for developers or investors to offload either for sale or rent,"" said choy. the situation is exacerbated by the fact that foreigners are presently not allowed to purchase homes in malaysia under the malaysia my second home program (mm2h) scheme, which has been temporarily suspended since july 2020. mm2h was suspended by the ministry of tourism, arts and culture (motac) in line with the government's decision to bar foreigners from entering enter malaysia following the outbreak of covid-19. motac added that the government is currently reviewing the mm2h programme, and that foreigners still interested to participate must abide by the latest requirements when it is reinstated. mm2h president anthony liew was quoted by local media last sunday (jun 6) saying that the suspension has curtailed interest from singapore and china buyers in johor property. ""the three big chinese developers, country garden pacificview, r&f development and greenland group, have seen the demand for their developments in johor from chinese buyers drop,"" loke reportedly said. even owners of the more premium, newer developments in johor bahru are having problems trying to attract tenants. a taiwanese woman, who wanted to be known only as k, told cna that she has put up her 3-room condominium unit at the astaka for rent, after she headed back home when the pandemic hit. the astaka, a premium condominium located at bukit senyum in the heart of johor bahru, saw 70 per cent of its units snapped up by buyers when it was first launched in 2019. the two towers, standing at 65 and 70 storeys, have 3 or 4 room units of between 2,207 and 2,659 sq ft. however, after the pandemic hit, demand has dried up and owners who are not in johor are not able to find interested tenants. k told cna that she had purchased the unit in 2019, with the idea of renting it out for investment returns.  however, after almost two years, no tenant has made a ""suitable offer"". she first listed her 3-room unit at rm5,700 a month.  fifteen months later, she has lowered the rental price to rm3,800 and there has not been a single offer from potential tenants.  she purchased the unit for around rm2 million. ""i think considering the circumstances, i have no choice but to lower the rental price.  i notice that there have been no offers.  i am patient.  hopefully, when the pandemic is over, there will be people who are interested,"" said k. the demand from johoreans has also weakened, as they reel from the effects of the pandemic. khor yu leng, a political economist with consultancy firm segi enam advisors, said that besides border closures restricting foreign buyers or tenants, locals are also grappling with the economic impact of covid-19 and their disposable income has been restricted. she noted that locals with more spending power were typically johoreans who commuted daily to singapore for work.  however, with borders closed from daily commuting, this group is either out of work or is now based in singapore. ""the spending power of the former johor daily commuters and singapore residents who visited johor weekly or otherwise has diminished or disappeared from the johor economy,"" said khor. she noted that the impact on the johor economy meant that some johoreans have turned to the state government for financial assistance,and buying luxury condominium property is not realistic. ""a year later, with johor's economic umbilical still cut off from singapore, and malaysia suffering a big wave of covid-19, informal social support activities (to help the lower-income households) have been ongoing,"" added khor. even with the overall value and volume of transactions increasing prior to covid-19, khor noted there were signs that some condominium developments were struggling to sell their excess units. in its report, henry butcher malaysia highlighted that johor was the state with the highest proportion of unsold residential properties in the country, even before covid-19. the report said that johor contributes 19. 5 per cent of ""overhang"" residential properties and a whopping 73. 7 per cent of all overhang condominium apartments in the country in 2019. ""of these, approximately 34 per cent of the overhang service apartments/sohos are priced over rm1 million which were believed to have been designed specifically for foreign investors from singapore and china,"" the report said. landed homes also affectedbesides condominiums and serviced apartments, those with landed properties in the southern state are also concerned about depreciating values. a singaporean who wanted to be known only as mustaqim, who owns a 2-storey 4,000 sq ft terrace home at gated community horizon hills, has expressed concern that the value of his house is depreciating since he purchased it in july 2017. horizon hills is popular among foreign buyers, especially singaporeans, as it is a mere 15-minute drive to tuas second link.  the development is also close to amenities such as the sunway iskandar township, which has hospitals, malls as well as prestigious international schools. mustaqim bought the house as a retirement home rather than an investment, but admitted he was worried that based onrecent price trendsin the area, his home has lost some of its value. he bought his home a decade after the development was launched in 2017, for around rm1. 8 million. ""with covid-19, some of my neighbours who are singaporeans have decided to sell their homes for rm1. 1 million to rm1. 2 million.  it is spoiling the market a bit but i can understand why with the borders closed,"" said mustaqim. ""i am concerned that this downward trend will continue and my home's value will be going lower and lower.  i would be owning a depreciating asset,"" he added. however, mustaqim, who is currently in singapore due to the borders being closed, is determined to wait out the pandemic. ""the value will rise again post-pandemic,"" said mustaqim. property agents in johor have also seen their livelihoods hit with the lower volume and value of transactions during covid-19. an agent who wanted to be quoted only as brian, told cna that he has been forced to take a second mortgage on his own home as the number of transactions has dried up since the pandemic. ""some months i barely make any transactions, so i've been looking around for another job to tide through over the next few months,"" he said. the agent, who specialises in selling condominiums in the central johor bahru area, said that most developments have the same problem – too many units on sale with ""almost zero"" demand. ""some months, we have to live with zero completed transactions.  so, the situation is really bad for us,"" added brian. the tightening of restrictions during the ongoing nationwide mco 3. 0 meant that agents are not able to legally arrange physical viewings of homes for any interested buyers or tenants.  with virtual viewings being the only permissible option, it becomes even harder to make a sale. cna has approached the johor chief minister's office, as well as the state housing and local government committee for comments on the state of the property market and whether measures will be taken to assist industry players. empty homes susceptible to crimeanother headache for owners whose properties have been left empty is their susceptibility to break-ins. economist khor said that properties that are not located within gated communities may be more vulnerable. investors with properties in johor but cannot be physically there are now confronting the practical problems of how to guard, maintain and have a house-sitter, she said. ""the reality of the prolonged border closure will surely crimp some future demand,"" she added. in september last year, it was reported that police had arrested two men for breaking into houses at taman bukit indah, a suburb where foreigners have been known to invest in property. johor police added that the pair had specifically targeted vacant homes whose owners were in singapore due to the border restrictions. rahmah zainolabidin, a singaporean who chose to remain in johor bahru during this pandemic, told cna that she has been taking care of homes belonging to her family members who have chosen to return to the city-state. she told cna how her sister's home, a terrace house located in a non-gated community in taman bukit indah, had been robbed in august 2020. ""when i was walking towards the home from afar, i could see that something was wrong.  the windows were pried open wide and the gate was ajar,"" said the 65-year-old. ""they broke the gate grilles and drilled into the safe, taking thousands of dollars in cash as well as jewellery,"" she added. rahmah said that her sister was considering selling the house, but she had to first set aside money to repair the damage inflicted. ""it is sad because she already got robbed, but now she has to fork out more money to try to sell it off.  and in this market, i'm convinced there will be little interest, especially with the number of robberies reported in the area,"" rahmah added. ""crime is a serious issue . . .  i don't think people would consider buying homes in areas with high incidences of break-ins. ""charmaine tay, a freelance agent who focuses on property deals in johor bahru and the medini iskandar malaysia area, told cna that houses located in areas with a high incidence of break-ins have seen a drop in value and demand. ""many buyers are aware that landed homes are susceptible to break-ins in johor, so they tend to look for those located within gated areas where there are security checks,"" said tay. ""but for those houses outside gated communities, especially in areas like taman bukit indah where robbery is common, they are harder to sell, and the value has depreciated faster recently,"" she addedbuyers from other states, overseas bargain hunters could spark recoverythose interviewed by cna said that there are two groups of buyers who could help pave the way towards recovery in the residential property sector. the first group is potential buyers from other states. choy of knight frank predicted that domestic tourism will likely recover first.  she noted how in the second half of 2020, the property market saw a slight rebound when movement restrictions were lifted domestically before another wave of infections hit in september. choy said that many malaysians who have been stuck in kuala lumpur would then take some ""leisure time off"" and possibly buy or rent properties in the smaller cities. however, she warned that the high-rise residential sector in johor would only see gradual and slow progress as the units, which are in abundant oversupply, are not priced right for locals. ""developers have since then restructured and re-looked at planning to target more local purchasers i. e.  by reducing unit sizing and thus, the end pricing – this makes the prices more palatable for the local community,"" said choy. the return of foreign buyers may also provide some relief. choy highlighted the reopening of borders will provide ""a more optimistic outlook with more certainty and flexibility on travel arrangements"", especially with the currently low prices. she noted that even as there will be bargain hunters from overseas, foreign buyers should note the johor land administration has stated that there is a minimum threshold of rm1 million on residential homes for non-malaysian citizens. with borders remaining shut in the short term, the situation seems especially bleak for those desperate to sell their homes like gan, who cannot find a buyer despite lowering his asking price for his 4-room apartment at lovell country garden. ""it's a sticky situation.  although we had good times using it as a weekend home, ultimately buying it was a wrong decision we now regret,"" he said. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

jonathan gan purchased a 4-room condominium at lovell country garden in 2018, he thought he had clinched his dream retirement home.', ""the freehold apartment located near johor bahru's city centre was twice the size of his 3-room hdb flat in singapore, but the cost was only half of the latter when he bought it directly from the developers."", '""the best thing about the unit is the amazing view.', 'you never get anything close to it at such value in singapore,"" added the 42-year-old, who lives with his wife and two daughters.', 'the apartment, like most units in the lovell development, overlooks the straits of johor.', 'the balcony opens up to a picturesque sea view and there is a sandy beach below.', '""it was the ideal weekend home,"" said gan.', '""but now it\'s becoming a bugbear.', '""just three years after he purchased it, gan who bought the unit at around rm1 million (us$242,000) is having a hard time trying to sell it, even though the asking price is a fraction of what he paid for it.', 'since the covid-19 pandemic hit last year, border closures between singapore and malaysia meant that he and his family could not visit his weekend home.', ""furthermore, gan's business in singapore has been affected by the pandemic, and he now needs to sell the apartment to gain some liquidity."", '""all this was never part of the plan.', 'but the house is just left there, collecting dust and its value is going down by the day.', 'we felt it is better to cut our losses and try to get rid of it,"" he told cna.', 'despite being on the market for over a year, there have been no takers.', 'he has engaged agents and even advertised the unit on various property portals but to no avail.', '""there is not much hope.', 'barely anyone has viewed or signalled interest,"" he said.', 'gan is among property owners in johor bahru who are having issues trying to sell their properties, as the market is in the doldrums due to the prolonged effects of covid-19.', 'condominium developments around johor bahru were built with foreign buyers in mind, but the pandemic has closed borders, leaving many of them empty.', 'units owned by those from china, singapore, hong kong have been left unoccupiedwhile homes that were left unsold have stayed empty.', 'landed property is also facing potential depreciation.', 'johor\'s oversupply problemaccording to statistics compiled by property consultancy firm henry butcher, the value and volume of residential property transactions in johor had been climbing ""rather steadily"" from 2017 until 2019. in its report on the outlook of the malaysian property market in 2021, the firm noted that the volume of transactions rose 8 per cent in 2018 and 7.', '5 per cent in 2019, while the value of the transactions increased by 1.', '5 per cent in 2018 and 15.', '9 per cent in 2019. the report highlighted that the movement control order (mco) imposed by the malaysian government from mar 18, 2020 was a key reason that reversed the upward trend.', ""it said that in the first nine months of 2020, the volume and value of transactions declined by almost a quarter compared to the same period in 2019. property analyst debbie choy, who is director of knight frank malaysia's johor branch, said the situation is particularly bad for condominiums and serviced apartments, of which there is an oversupply in the iskandar region."", '""many developments were targeting a large proportion of overseas buyers.', 'with the prolonged effects of covid-19 restricting movements, it has been challenging for developers or investors to offload either for sale or rent,"" said choy.', ""the situation is exacerbated by the fact that foreigners are presently not allowed to purchase homes in malaysia under the malaysia my second home program (mm2h) scheme, which has been temporarily suspended since july 2020. mm2h was suspended by the ministry of tourism, arts and culture (motac) in line with the government's decision to bar foreigners from entering enter malaysia following the outbreak of covid-19."", 'motac added that the government is currently reviewing the mm2h programme, and that foreigners still interested to participate must abide by the latest requirements when it is reinstated.', 'mm2h president anthony liew was quoted by local media last sunday (jun 6) saying that the suspension has curtailed interest from singapore and china buyers in johor property.', '""the three big chinese developers, country garden pacificview, r&f development and greenland group, have seen the demand for their developments in johor from chinese buyers drop,"" loke reportedly said.', 'even owners of the more premium, newer developments in johor bahru are having problems trying to attract tenants.', 'a taiwanese woman, who wanted to be known only as k, told cna that she has put up her 3-room condominium unit at the astaka for rent, after she headed back home when the pandemic hit.', 'the astaka, a premium condominium located at bukit senyum in the heart of johor bahru, saw 70 per cent of its units snapped up by buyers when it was first launched in 2019. the two towers, standing at 65 and 70 storeys, have 3 or 4 room units of between 2,207 and 2,659 sq ft. however, after the pandemic hit, demand has dried up and owners who are not in johor are not able to find interested tenants.', 'k told cna that she had purchased the unit in 2019, with the idea of renting it out for investment returns.', 'however, after almost two years, no tenant has made a ""suitable offer"".', 'she first listed her 3-room unit at rm5,700 a month.', 'fifteen months later, she has lowered the rental price to rm3,800 and there has not been a single offer from potential tenants.', 'she purchased the unit for around rm2 million.', '""i think considering the circumstances, i have no choice but to lower the rental price.', 'i notice that there have been no offers.', 'i am patient.', 'hopefully, when the pandemic is over, there will be people who are interested,"" said k. the demand from johoreans has also weakened, as they reel from the effects of the pandemic.', 'khor yu leng, a political economist with consultancy firm segi enam advisors, said that besides border closures restricting foreign buyers or tenants, locals are also grappling with the economic impact of covid-19 and their disposable income has been restricted.', 'she noted that locals with more spending power were typically johoreans who commuted daily to singapore for work.', 'however, with borders closed from daily commuting, this group is either out of work or is now based in singapore.', '""the spending power of the former johor daily commuters and singapore residents who visited johor weekly or otherwise has diminished or disappeared from the johor economy,"" said khor.', 'she noted that the impact on the johor economy meant that some johoreans have turned to the state government for financial assistance,and buying luxury condominium property is not realistic.', '""a year later, with johor\'s economic umbilical still cut off from singapore, and malaysia suffering a big wave of covid-19, informal social support activities (to help the lower-income households) have been ongoing,"" added khor.', 'even with the overall value and volume of transactions increasing prior to covid-19, khor noted there were signs that some condominium developments were struggling to sell their excess units.', 'in its report, henry butcher malaysia highlighted that johor was the state with the highest proportion of unsold residential properties in the country, even before covid-19.', 'the report said that johor contributes 19.', '5 per cent of ""overhang"" residential properties and a whopping 73.', '7 per cent of all overhang condominium apartments in the country in 2019.', '""of these, approximately 34 per cent of the overhang service apartments/sohos are priced over rm1 million which were believed to have been designed specifically for foreign investors from singapore and china,"" the report said.', 'landed homes also affectedbesides condominiums and serviced apartments, those with landed properties in the southern state are also concerned about depreciating values.', 'a singaporean who wanted to be known only as mustaqim, who owns a 2-storey 4,000 sq ft terrace home at gated community horizon hills, has expressed concern that the value of his house is depreciating since he purchased it in july 2017. horizon hills is popular among foreign buyers, especially singaporeans, as it is a mere 15-minute drive to tuas second link.', 'the development is also close to amenities such as the sunway iskandar township, which has hospitals, malls as well as prestigious international schools.', 'mustaqim bought the house as a retirement home rather than an investment, but admitted he was worried that based onrecent price trendsin the area, his home has lost some of its value.', 'he bought his home a decade after the development was launched in 2017, for around rm1.', '8 million.', '""with covid-19, some of my neighbours who are singaporeans have decided to sell their homes for rm1.', '1 million to rm1.', '2 million.', 'it is spoiling the market a bit but i can understand why with the borders closed,"" said mustaqim.', '""i am concerned that this downward trend will continue and my home\'s value will be going lower and lower.', 'i would be owning a depreciating asset,"" he added.', 'however, mustaqim, who is currently in singapore due to the borders being closed, is determined to wait out the pandemic.', '""the value will rise again post-pandemic,"" said mustaqim.', 'property agents in johor have also seen their livelihoods hit with the lower volume and value of transactions during covid-19.', 'an agent who wanted to be quoted only as brian, told cna that he has been forced to take a second mortgage on his own home as the number of transactions has dried up since the pandemic.', '""some months i barely make any transactions, so i\'ve been looking around for another job to tide through over the next few months,"" he said.', 'the agent, who specialises in selling condominiums in the central johor bahru area, said that most developments have the same problem – too many units on sale with ""almost zero"" demand.', '""some months, we have to live with zero completed transactions.', 'so, the situation is really bad for us,"" added brian.', 'the tightening of restrictions during the ongoing nationwide mco 3.', '0 meant that agents are not able to legally arrange physical viewings of homes for any interested buyers or tenants.', 'with virtual viewings being the only permissible option, it becomes even harder to make a sale.', ""cna has approached the johor chief minister's office, as well as the state housing and local government committee for comments on the state of the property market and whether measures will be taken to assist industry players."", 'empty homes susceptible to crimeanother headache for owners whose properties have been left empty is their susceptibility to break-ins.', 'economist khor said that properties that are not located within gated communities may be more vulnerable.', 'investors with properties in johor but cannot be physically there are now confronting the practical problems of how to guard, maintain and have a house-sitter, she said.', '""the reality of the prolonged border closure will surely crimp some future demand,"" she added.', 'in september last year, it was reported that police had arrested two men for breaking into houses at taman bukit indah, a suburb where foreigners have been known to invest in property.', 'johor police added that the pair had specifically targeted vacant homes whose owners were in singapore due to the border restrictions.', 'rahmah zainolabidin, a singaporean who chose to remain in johor bahru during this pandemic, told cna that she has been taking care of homes belonging to her family members who have chosen to return to the city-state.', ""she told cna how her sister's home, a terrace house located in a non-gated community in taman bukit indah, had been robbed in august 2020."", '""when i was walking towards the home from afar, i could see that something was wrong.', 'the windows were pried open wide and the gate was ajar,"" said the 65-year-old.', '""they broke the gate grilles and drilled into the safe, taking thousands of dollars in cash as well as jewellery,"" she added.', 'rahmah said that her sister was considering selling the house, but she had to first set aside money to repair the damage inflicted.', '""it is sad because she already got robbed, but now she has to fork out more money to try to sell it off.', 'and in this market, i\'m convinced there will be little interest, especially with the number of robberies reported in the area,"" rahmah added.', '""crime is a serious issue .', '.', '.', ""i don't think people would consider buying homes in areas with high incidences of break-ins."", '""charmaine tay, a freelance agent who focuses on property deals in johor bahru and the medini iskandar malaysia area, told cna that houses located in areas with a high incidence of break-ins have seen a drop in value and demand.', '""many buyers are aware that landed homes are susceptible to break-ins in johor, so they tend to look for those located within gated areas where there are security checks,"" said tay.', '""but for those houses outside gated communities, especially in areas like taman bukit indah where robbery is common, they are harder to sell, and the value has depreciated faster recently,"" she addedbuyers from other states, overseas bargain hunters could spark recoverythose interviewed by cna said that there are two groups of buyers who could help pave the way towards recovery in the residential property sector.', 'the first group is potential buyers from other states.', 'choy of knight frank predicted that domestic tourism will likely recover first.', 'she noted how in the second half of 2020, the property market saw a slight rebound when movement restrictions were lifted domestically before another wave of infections hit in september.', 'choy said that many malaysians who have been stuck in kuala lumpur would then take some ""leisure time off"" and possibly buy or rent properties in the smaller cities.', 'however, she warned that the high-rise residential sector in johor would only see gradual and slow progress as the units, which are in abundant oversupply, are not priced right for locals.', '""developers have since then restructured and re-looked at planning to target more local purchasers i. e.  by reducing unit sizing and thus, the end pricing – this makes the prices more palatable for the local community,"" said choy.', 'the return of foreign buyers may also provide some relief.', 'choy highlighted the reopening of borders will provide ""a more optimistic outlook with more certainty and flexibility on travel arrangements"", especially with the currently low prices.', 'she noted that even as there will be bargain hunters from overseas, foreign buyers should note the johor land administration has stated that there is a minimum threshold of rm1 million on residential homes for non-malaysian citizens.', 'with borders remaining shut in the short term, the situation seems especially bleak for those desperate to sell their homes like gan, who cannot find a buyer despite lowering his asking price for his 4-room apartment at lovell country garden.',

2021-06-12,"China passes anti-sanctions law that 'can target individuals, families, organisations', China News.","china's top legislative body has passed an anti-sanctions law , providing legal backing for sweeping retaliation against any individuals, their families and organisations responsible for imposing foreign sanctions against the country. the legislation was passed on thursday at the closing session of the national people's congress (npc) standing committee, and was effective the same day. tam yiu chung, hong kong's sole delegate to the npc standing committee, said that under the new law, the state council and its agencies would be responsible for coordinating retaliatory measures. ""these measures can be applied to organisations and individuals, as well as extended to the individuals' spouses, relatives and the organisations that they belong to,"" he said. [embed]https://youtu. be/z5nydpsky0a[/embed]tam said that under article 6 of the new law, beijing's retaliatory measures could include denial of visa applications or entry into china.  in the case of visa holders, authorities could declare their document invalid and deport them. individuals' property or assets could be frozen or seized, and institutions could be restricted from conducting transactions with individuals or organisations targeted, he said. the law also specified that no one in the country could help other countries implement measures against china, and people must instead help beijing's authorities to execute retaliatory measures.  individuals and organisations affected by sanctions could make claims in mainland courts, tam said. state media said the move was intended to provide a legal basis for china to respond to sanctions.  china has issued counter-sanctions in response to sanctions against it from the united states, the european union, britain and canada over beijing's political crackdown in hong kong and treatment of ethnic minority groups in xinjiang . after the law was passed, li zhanshu, head of the npc standing committee, said : ""china will not give up its legitimate interest.  and no one should have any illusion of letting china swallow the bitter fruit that harms our own interests. ""chinese foreign ministry spokesman wang wenbin said the passage of the new law showed china's determination to protect its sovereignty and core interests, and would not affect its relations with other countries. [[nid:495641]]the anti-sanctions law was announced on monday night by state media and underwent a second reading but skipped a third, in the same way the national security law for hong kong went through the legislative process. the new law is the strongest tool so far for china to respond to foreign sanctions, after the ministry of commerce in january issued a ""blocking statute"" requiring chinese companies to report foreign restrictions on economic or trade activities.  it had last september unveiled an unreliable entity list for foreign businesses. washington has imposed a number of sanctions on china over its policies in hong kong and xinjiang, including targeting hong kong's leader carrie lam cheng yuet ngor and xinjiang 's communist party chief chen quanguo, as well as other senior mainland and hong kong officials and the 14 vice-chairpersons of the npc.  canada, britain and the european union also imposed sanctions on china. tian feilong, an associate professor at beihang university's law school, has been involved in the consultations over the new legislation.  he said the draft of the law was first read in april, after the us senate committee on foreign relations backed an act to counter competition from china. he said discussion about the law started last year when donald trump was still us president, but china was waiting to see how trump's successor, joe biden , would approach relations with china. ""the central leadership was already considering it last year, and the academic community has made suggestions,"" he said.  ""the timing is based on biden's china policies. ""[embed]https://youtu. be/ufqdggczq9c[/embed]tam said it was not specified in the legislation whether the new law would apply to hong kong and macau through local legislation. ""for a mainland law to apply in hong kong, it needs to be inserted into annex iii of the basic law . . .  but the new law did not mention how the law would be applied outside the mainland,"" he said.  ""i would not say that it could not be applied in hong kong either.  probably the mainland authorities need more time to study its application. ""[[nid:518182]]tam, who is also sanctioned by the us for the enactment of the national security law in hong kong, which critics say has undermined the city's autonomy, said he supported the new law but had no plan to invoke any provision in it himself. ""i have not yet considered how this law will help me,"" he said.  ""i just think that from the macro level, it is good to have this law so that it's not just individual agencies or the central government [making] retaliatory measures, but the responsibility of the state council as a whole. ""i support this law because as the chinese saying goes, 'offend no one if none offends you, but retaliate if you are under attack. '""there have been concerns among foreign companies over the lack of transparency around the legislative process and the potential impact on businesses in china and hong kong, which analysts say will need to be wary of being linked to foreign entities under chinese sanctions. greg gilligan, chairman of the american chamber of commerce in china, said it was difficult to comment on the law until details were available. ""however, where there is any disagreement across borders, governments need to come together to reconcile this in a way that allows businesses to remain legally compliant within the jurisdictions in which they operate,"" he said. this article was first published in south china morning post.

2021-06-12,Former student of Ngee Ann Polytechnic lecturer who made racist remarks to mixed-race couple recalls being subjected to Islamophobic comments in class.,"source: nurul fatimah iskandar (@_new_rule_) / instagramon the heels of the suspension of the ngee ann polytechnic lecturer who was caught on video making racist remarks to an interracial couple from his teaching duties, a former student of his took to social media to share her own experience of being subject to islamophobic remarks from him in front of a class. ms nurul fatimah binti iskandar, who was a student of mr tan boon lee for an object oriented programming module in 2017, said in an instagram post on wednesday (9 june) that the lecturer had ""used our class period to have a full-on discourse about islam"". ""i was the only muslim in class.  he opened websites on the projector, pointing out things he didn't agree with about the quran and prophet muhammad s. a. w to the class,"" she said. based on ms nurul's record of an instagram story posted on 28 july 2017, the date of the incident, among the comments mr tan had reportedly made were ""only animals will treat their children like how allah does to his people"" and ""what type of father tells you to worship him five times a day and threatens to send you to hell if you don't?"". such remarks, she said, were merely ""the tip of the iceberg"". to worsen matters, mr tan had singled out ms nurul — who was sitting in the front of the class — and asked her if she agreed with him. ""i could barely open my mouth amidst his continuous sweeping statements.  i was barely 17, fresh out of 10 years of madrasah trying to assimilate into the new secular environment,"" she lamented. the situation had ""escalated so badly"" that ms nurul ended up sitting outside on the floor of the corridor with her classmate, merick while waiting for his ""unsettling speech"" to end. merick had initiated the walk-out, according to ms nurul. ms nurul noted that she made a complaint regarding the incident with mr tan, but no action was taken. touching on why she went public with her story after mr tan's identity was revealed in the recent viral case, ms nurul said that she ""can only imagine how many more times he had been racist and islamophobic in the institution of education over the years"". ""after his suspension is over, he might return to the classrooms.  he should not be allowed back,"" she stressed.  ""a racist islamophobe has no place educating our youths. ""particularly taking into consideration mr tan's position as a senior lecturer, it is crucial that such instances of bigotry are thwarted from the start to prevent ""strife, prejudice, and racism"" resulting from the spread of ""sweeping misconceptions"" about a particular faith, said ms nurul. ""my ex-classmates did their best to help me find evidence.  more people are coming out to testify.  more people are showing support.  we may still be far from utopia but the fact people are thinking, trying and taking action means we are definitely on the right path,"" she concluded. a post shared by nurul fatimah binti iskandar (@_new_rule_)in the recent viral video, mr tan had publicly accused mr dave parkash of ""preying on chinese girls"" while the latter was on a night out with his girlfriend. mr dave clarified that he is half-indian and half-filipino, while his girlfriend — who recorded the incident — is half-chinese and half-thai. undeterred by mr dave's reply, the man continued his verbal abuse against mr dave, saying: ""i got nothing against you staying in singapore. """"the only thing is you are preying on chinese girl, i tell you the chinese won't like it,"" while admitting that he himself is ""racist"". the man also accused mr dave's girlfriend of ""disgracing me"", saying that the interracial couple should date people of their own race instead. ""you don't see a chinese guy preying on an indian girl,"" he further said to mr dave. mr tan teaches at np's school of engineering.  he appears to have been awarded the long service medal in 2019 under the annual national day awards, as listed on prime minister's office website. an np spokesperson told channel news asia on monday that the polytechnic is aware of the video and has suspended him from teaching duties. ""we regret that the individual in question is a member of our staff,"" said the spokesperson. they added that the polytechnic takes ""a very serious view"" of the matter, as the remarks are ""highly offensive, disrespectful and go against our staff code of conduct and values as a community"". ""we are investigating this matter internally, including considering the appropriate disciplinary action to be taken.  meanwhile, the staff in question has been suspended from his teaching duties,"" the spokesperson added. the incident is currently under police investigations.  the police confirmed on sunday that reports had been lodged and that a 60-year-old man was assisting with investigations

2021-06-12,"UMNO opposed to any extension of state of Emergency, says party president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi as he calls for Parliament suspension to end.","source: the sun dailykuala lumpur, malaysia — the united malays national organisation (umno) is opposed to any extension of the current state of emergency in malaysia, says party president ahmad zahid hamidi after an audience with king al-sultan abdullah on friday (11 june). ahmad zahid told reporters outside the national palace here today that he had mooted the prospect during his hour-long audience with sultan abdullah ""to ensure the country's democratic system is defended"". ""it was obvious that even without the emergency, the government could previously handle matters related to fighting the covid-19 pandemic,"" he added. while calling for an end to the emergency, the bagan datuk member of parliament (mp) also proposed the resumption of parliament sittings. ""umno believes that parliament is an important official platform to voice the people's concerns (on matters such) such as loan moratoriums, i-sinar and i-lestari 2. 0 and other forms of assistance for everyone,"" he said. ahmad zahid is one of several politicians who have openly spoken up against the state of emergency and the suspension of parliament, the latter of which is enabled by the former. parti keadilan rakyat president anwar ibrahim in january filed a suit against muhyiddin and the federal government, on the grounds that the latter had allegedly advised the nation's king to suspend parliament sittings during the state of emergency. malay mail reported that in a separate statement filed in court, anwar had argued that the suspension of parliament under emergency powers blocks parliament's freedom to ensure transparent debates, government accountability, and proper checks and balances on the executive branch of the government in making and enacting laws during the pandemic. anwar was also one of the politicians who have met with the king this week.  he was granted an audience with sultan abdullah with parti amanah negara president mohamad sabu and democratic action party (dap) secretary-general lim guan eng — all component parties of the pakatan harapan coalition. former prime minister mahathir mohamad, whose parti pejuang tanah air political party has yet to be registered, also had a meeting with the king, during which he proposed the setting up of a national operations council (mageran) in the present circumstances. mageran was set up after the 13 may racial riots in 1969 to restore the rule of law and order in the country. several political leaders have since challenged dr mahathir's proposal to establish mageran. ahmad zahid told reporters that the idea of mageran should have been brought forth at the start of the emergency period. he added that he did not discuss the mageran issue with the king. ""i feel it is something normal outside the scope of the existing situation because the emergency is supposed to cover it but it has been used to achieve other purposes,"" said ahmad zahid. in a joint statement on friday, anwar, mohamad sabu, and lim said that their objection is grounded in their belief that for a parliamentary democracy to truly function, the emergency must be lifted and parliament must be allowed to reconvene. ""the solution to the people's problems in relation to covid-19, the economy and even politics requires a democracy that functions well, and the best avenue to hear out their grievances and to find solutions to them is parliament,"" they said. klang mp charles santiago also called for the end of the emergency and for parliament sittings to resume via both physical and virtual means. in a tweet on friday, the dap politician wrote: ""don't make a mockery of parliamentary democracy.  end emergency, reconvene parliament via physical & virtual sessions. ""santiago also expressed his objection against mageran in the same tweet, saying: ""no to noc. ""don't make a mockery of parliamentary democracy.  end emergency, reconvene parliament via physical & virtual sessions.  no to noc. — charles santiago (@mpklang) june 11, 2021prime minister muhyiddin yassin in march defended the emergency proclamation, stating that it is not a tool for him to cling on to his position but a pre-emptive move in managing the covid-19 situation in the country. the emergency would be lifted earlier than its scheduled end on 1 august if the government is able to control the pandemic situation in the country, he added. ""if the independent special committee says [the emergency] can be put to an end earlier, i will just follow that.  we also do not want to be under restriction by such regulations forever,"" said muhyiddin. sultan abdullah is slated to discuss the emergency and the covid-19 situation with eight other rulers in a special conference next wednesday (16 june). the king's succession of physical meetings with political leaders this week is set to end on friday.  he is slated to have a virtual meeting with sarawak's ruling party gabungan parti sarawak on monday.  © 2006 2021 the online

2021-06-12,"'Life goes on, it's just tennis,' says Nadal after French Open reign ends.","paris: rafael nadal shrugged off his epic loss to novak djokovic at the french open insisting ""life goes on"" as the 13-time champion suffered just his third ever defeat in 108 matches in paris over 16 years. in their 58th career clash, world number one djokovic triumphed 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 in the semi-final and stays on course to capture a 19th major and become the first man in over 50 years to win all four slams twice. nadal, the defending champion and chasing a record-setting 21st grand slam title, refused to dwell on the consequences of his 4-hour 11-minute loss. ""i am sad to have lost in the most important tournament of the year for me, but life goes on, it is nothing more than a defeat on a tennis court,"" said 35-year-old nadal. ""if everything goes well, tomorrow i will be at home with my family and friends, and then we will see what is next. ""nadal said he plans to be back in 2022 although admitting that time is not on his side if he wants to re-establish his paris dominance. had he made sunday's championship match, he would have been the oldest roland garros finalist in the modern era. ""although it is a very important tournament for me, i am aware that you cannot win it 15 or 16 times,"" he added. ""next year i will come again, god willing, with the belief and with the necessary work to be able to give myself another chance. ""in their 58th career meeting, and ninth at the french open, nadal had looked comfortably on course for victory when he raced to a 5-0 lead in the first set. but 2016 champion djokovic, the man now responsible for two of nadal's losses in paris having also triumphed in the 2015 quarter-finals, hit back. ""did not hurt him""as the match progressed into the later heavier, humid and slower conditions, the world number one flourished. he claimed a titanic 92-minute third set which had seen him serve for it at 5-4 and then have to save a set point in the 12th game. in the fourth set, he was 0-2 down before racing away with the next six games for his second win in paris over nadal in nine meetings. that sequence also included defeats in the 2012, 2014 and 2020 finals. djokovic will now be playing in his sixth roland garros final and 29th at the slams. ""in the end, of course, if you win the third set you can say that was the key, because it changes the dynamic,"" said nadal. ""at times, my ball did not hurt him.  you have to give him credit, congratulate him, but i know i can play better on this court. ""when asked if he had faced the best djokovic performance of their 15-year rivalry, he was adamant. ""no, that's what i feel.  he has not faced my best self either. ""there were games on the limit, games that anyone could win, and today it was for him. ""despite that, there is a degree of evidence that nadal is beginning to lose more epics than he wins at the slams. at the australian open in february, he lost to stefanos tsitsipas from two sets up in a five-set quarter-final defeat. tsitsipas, who faces djokovic in sunday's final, is 13 years younger than nadal. in the wimbledon semi-finals in 2018, nadal lost a final set 10-8 to djokovic after quitting injured in the fifth set of his australian open semi against marin cilic earlier that same year. even gilles muller of luxembourg beat him at wimbledon in 2017, courtesy of a 15-13 final set. ""it doesn't matter,"" added a rueful nadal.  ""that's tennis.  the player who gets used to the conditions better is the player who deserves to win.

on, it is nothing more than a defeat on a tennis court,"" said 35-year-old nadal.', '""if everything goes well, tomorrow i will be at home with my family and friends, and then we will see what is next.', '""nadal said he plans to be back in 2022 although admitting that time is not on his side if he wants to re-establish his paris dominance.', ""had he made sunday's championship match, he would have been the oldest roland garros finalist in the modern era."", '""although it is a very important tournament for me, i am aware that you cannot win it 15 or 16 times,"" he added.', '""next year i

2021-06-12,Cleaners’ salaries in Singapore to increase from 2023; netizens question the delay and exclusivity.,"cleaners in singapore will see their salaries increase each year over six years from 2023, after the proposals made by the tripartite cluster for cleaners (tcc) on cleaning wage ladder were accepted by the government earlier on monday (7 june). starting from 2023 to 2028, the base wages for cleaners who are singaporean and permanent residents will go up on a year-on-year basis. under the progressive wage model (pwm), the increase will be for cleaners across all job levels and it will rise up to between s$1,570 and s$2,210 in 2023.  the amount will subsequently increase by at least s$170 annually until 2028. for example, a full-time general or indoor cleaner will be entitled for a monthly wage of s$1,570 in july 2023.  this means the worker gets a pay hike of s$258, which is nearly 20 percent increase from the recommended salary of s$1,312 in 2022. on the other hand, the recommended annual increments for pwm from 1 july 2020 to 30 june 2023 was 3 percent a year. the basic salary of cleaners has gradually went up over the years, and now it stands at s$1,236.  under the pwm, it is expected to go up to s$1,274 in july this year and to s$1,312 in july 2022. based on this new wage adjustments, workers in different categories like restroom cleaners and healthcare cleaners will be paid at least s$1,795 yearly.  higher-skilled employees such as supervisors and mechanical drivers will be given at least s$2,210. it is said that this new system will benefit about 40,000 resident cleaners hired by more than 1,500 cleaning businesses. ""this is a timely and necessary review to recognise the importance and higher value of work shouldered by our cleaners, particularly during the covid-19 pandemic,"" said tcc and the national trades union congress (ntuc) in a joint media statement on monday. the pwm is created to raise the wages of lower-wage workers by upgrading their skills and increasing their productivity, and it has been a licensing condition for cleaning companies since 2014. according to ntuc, a survey conducted in 2020 found that almost all respondents pointed out that the job of cleaners has become more important, and 95 percent expressed that they should be paid higher. this is also the first wage review that takes reference from the tripartite workgroup on lower-wage workers' objective to ensure that wage growth is ""ambitious enough to close the gap with workers earning median wages"". ""in this pandemic, most of our workers, or cleaners are out there on the frontline . . .  we really need to show a commitment and our gratitude for what they've done, keeping singapore safe,"" said member of parliament mohd fahmi aliman (pap-marine parade). he added, ""i strongly urge all stakeholders to play a part in ensuring that our essential services workers in the environmental service industry can work with dignity. ""on monday, it was also announced that training guidelines for cleaners to get at least two workforce skills qualification (wsq) certificates in environmental cleaning modules or the equivalent have to be fulfilled by december 2022. ""this will help cleaners ensure their personal safety when carrying out cleaning tasks, especially with the increased cleaning demands and standards brought on by covid-19,"" said tcc and ntuc. after 2025, the number of wsq that general cleaners are required to complete will be increased to three.  as for those in higher job roles, they must complete four modules. chairman of the tcc and ntuc assistant director-general zainal sapari noted that the proposed wage ladders was made after extensive discussion and consultations with industry stakeholders. besides justifying the value of the work cleaners do, the ""aggressive wage increase"" also tries and hopes to narrow the gap between their wages and the salaries of other workers, said mr zainal. as for whether there's a target percentage of the media salary that cleaners' pay should eventually be pegged to, mr zainal asserted that it is ""premature"", but noted that the goal is for the annual wage increase to be higher than the median annual increase so the salary gap can be narrowed. additionally, mr zainal also said that the wage increase is done to also attract the younger generation into the industry.  ""we want to attract a younger workforce into this industry.  we want this to be a possible career that they can consider, compared to going into the gig economy,"" he noted. president of the environment management association of singapore tony chooi pointed out that he hopes the people of singapore would not pick a job as a cleaner as their ""last resort"". ""we are trying all ways to see how we are able to build the industry into something that is more attractive,"" he said. when asked if the higher salaries will cause cleaning companies to hire more foreigners instead, mr zainal said that this should not happen as the sector is regulated by the dependency ratio ceiling which is basically a quota for hiring singaporean workers, channel news asia (cna) said. upon reading this news, netizens commented in the facebook page of channel news asia (cna) asking why is the wage increase not happening now, but only in 2023.  they said that this salary increment is ""long overdue"" and it should be implemented now so cleaners don't suffer more from the current ""below sustainable income"".      others slammed the authorities as they noted that the gradual salary hike is still lower than other developed nations like japan.  one user even noted that the wages of cleaners in european countries, the us and taiwan are higher than white-collar managers. separately, a number of online users called for the government to implement a ""minimum wage"" for all low-skilled jobs.  they said this is so the workers are not cheated, be given basic benefits like medical subsidies and more. a couple of them asserted that the pwm should also be applied to other industries as many employers have been underpaying their staff.  one user noted that by increasing salaries of singaporeans and permanent residents in other sectors, it will ""(debunk) the myth typically coined that local can't work tough jobs"". responding to the authorities point that they hope an increased salary for cleaners will attract the youngsters into the industry, netizens asked if politicians will allow their kids to be a cleaner in the first place.    © 2006 2021 the

2021-06-12,Board of Inquiry appointed to investigate death of SMRT technician pinned under bus.,"singapore: a board of inquiry has been appointed to investigate the death of an smrt technician who was pinned under a bus he was repairing. the inquiry will be chaired by an smrt board member, mr quek gim pew,together with an independent mechanical engineering expert, associated professor patrick chua from the singapore institute of technology, the public transport operator said on friday (jun 11). smrt was also assisting the singapore police force and manpower ministry in their separate investigations, it said in a facebook post. the incident took place at the ang mo kio depot of smrt automotive services on the morning of jun 6.  the technician who died was a 43-year-old permanent resident. he was one of three technicians inspecting and repairing a loose steering wheel on a mini-bus, said smrt on friday. the technicians used two car jacks to lift the front of the mini-bus and two of them performed repair works under the vehicle, said the company. the two technicians were injured and immediately taken to the hospital, where one later died.  the other injured worker has been discharged and was on medical leave, said smrt.

2021-06-12,"F&B businesses, industry associations 'disappointed' at possible Jun 21 dine-in resumption.","singapore: while the announcement of an impending easing of pandemic curbs brought relief to some business sectors, several players in the food and beverage industry expressed disappointment at having to wait a little longer. the covid-19 multi-ministry task forceannounced on thursday (jun 10) that singapore will exit the current phase 2 (heightened alert) measures in two stages.  some activities including facials and saunas will be allowed to resume from jun 14, while others such as dining-in at f&b establishments will only start from jun 21, provided the covid-19 situation remains under control. ms hazel chua, a supervisor at birdie num num gastrobar, told cna that after thursday's announcement, the eatery had to cancel and reschedule customers' reservations.  many had indicated that they would visit the restaurant on the day of their original booking to do takeaways instead. a few regulars had also taken the initiative to reschedule their reservations after learning about the phased reopening, she added. ""maybe because we half-expected it already, we didn't feel too much of a shock.  just told ourselves to take it easy, and (it is) just another week or so,"" she said. ms chua estimates that business has dropped about 80 to 90 per cent in the past month. ""we serve our own food, but there are a lot of people who come here and they drink beer . . .  so i think they come here, mostly a lot for the environment as well.  although this time we adapted to it, we did takeaway for draft beers, we still saw the decline in our revenue for sure. ""for the owner of french restaurant the masses, there was a bit of ""sadness"" when he found out that dining-in may only begin on jun 21. ""but at the end of the day, i believe we have already pulled through that so-called one month,"" said mr dylan ong.  ""i think waiting on another week more, mainly it's just to be sure. ""the restaurant had been working with the expectation that dining-in would resume on jun 14. f&b operators continuing to ""haemorrhage""in a statement released on facebook on thursday, the restaurant association of singapore's president andrew kwan said that he was ""disappointed"" that the restrictions for dining-in would not be lifted from jun 14 ""as was keenly hoped for"". ""our f&b operators are continuing to haemorrhage with each extended day of 'no dine-in'.  members shared that the weekly burn rates to cover manpower and rentals alone range from a few thousand to over half a million dollars,"" mr kwan said. ""every additional day of low-to-no revenues will be the proverbial straw that breaks the camel's back. ""while mr kwan noted his appreciation for the government's extension of the jobs support scheme, which subsidies local workers' salaries, he urged other stakeholders like landlords to ""step up"" and ""jointly share in the huge impact sustained by their tenants"". ""without the ability to generate regular revenues, tenants are simply unable to pay full, unmitigated rentals,"" he said. mr kwan also requested priority vaccinations for staff in the f&b sector who are in daily contact with the public.  ""they are frontliners who are performing the mission critical role of feeding our population on a daily basis.  we must protect them as they go about carrying out their tasks faithfully. """"hawkers will be feeling quite disappointed""hawkers had also been hopeful that dining-in would resume on jun 14 and had been preparing for it, said chairman of the federation of merchants' associations singapore's (fmas) hawker division anthony low. ""from the past one month, quite a number of hawkers have been struggling.  so (with) the extension for one more week, i believe many of the hawkers will be feeling quite disappointed,"" he said. while the government had provided support for rentals, table-cleaning and centralised dishwashing services for phase 2 (heightened alert), hawkers were unsure if this support would cover the additional week from jun 14. ""we will try to put up the request, because even (an extension) of seven days without the table-cleaning fee . . .  would be at least some relief for us,"" he said. terry neo, founder of kopifellas, a chain of several food and drinks stalls, said that he had ""mixed feelings"" on the jun 21 reopening. ""we were definitely hopeful that we could start on the 14th, but at least on the other hand i'm glad that it's only just one week more,"" he said. ""we're just crossing our fingers because if things head south again then we probably will not even open up on the 21st.

2021-06-12,'Dominant' Italy get Euro 2020 off to impressive start against Turkey.,"italy got their euro 2020 campaign off the mark with an impressive 3-0 win over turkey in the curtain-raiser for the postponed continental tournament in front of their home fans in rome on friday. playing their first major tournament in five years after failing to qualify for the 2018 world cup, all the goals came in the second half in front of a stadio olimpico that was filled to a quarter of its capacity. merih demiral's own goal put italy ahead before ciro immobile and lorenzo insigne netted for roberto mancini's side in the group a opener. the win capped an emotional night in the italian capital which saw 16,000 fans return to the stadio olimpico. ""it was important to start well in rome and i think it's a satisfaction for the public and for italians,"" said mancini, whose side are now on a 28-match unbeaten run. ""there was a lot of help from the crowd.  it was a beautiful evening, i hope there are many others, but there are still six more for wembley. """"we were hoping for another result, but italy was dominant,"" said turkey coach senol gunes. ""the first goal changed things in the second half and we lost control of the game. ""there was a party atmosphere, with a spectacular sound and light show and firework display before kick-off for the opening of the month-long 24-team event, which will be played across 11 countries. there was a performance by the italian national police orchestra, a parade of huge inflatable balloons on the pitch, tenor andrea bocelli sang 'nessun dorma' before a virtual performance from martin garrix, bono and the edge. former italy world cup winners alessandro nesta and francesco totti, who played for lazio and roma during their careers at the stadio olimpico, carried the ball to the centre of the pitch before kick-off. berardi impresses -on the pitch, italy dominated early on with a three-man attack led by immobile, who plays for lazio. the 31-year-old had several near misses in the first half, coming up against a solid turkey defence who held their own. turkey could also thank goalkeeper ugurcan cakir for pulling off a big save on 23 minutes, tipping over italy captain giorgio chiellini's powerful goal-bound header off an insigne corner. italy finally got on the scoreboard eight minutes after the break when the unfortunate demiral found himself in the path of a federico berardi cross for immobile, the juventus defender bundling the ball into his own net. leonardo spinazzola had a chance for a second minutes later, with immobile sending the rebound wide. immobile finally got his goal, his 14th for italy, and first in a major tournament, in the 66th minute, scoring from a rebound after cakir had saved from spinazzola. and insigne curled in the third with 11 minutes to go. sassuolo winger berardi had a role in all three goals, with italy scoring three for the first time in a european championship match. all three italy forwards proved efficient on the night with a defence organised around juventus veterans chiellini and leonardo bonucci holding firm, securing a ninth straight clean sheet. ""we struggled at the start, we tried to accelerate but we hit a wall,"" said immobile. ""in the second half, they were a little more tired, they tried to rush us but the spaces opened up, and we saw our quality at that time. ""gianluigi donnarumma was largely unworried in the italy goal apart from a dangerous burak yilmaz cross after half an hour and a solo run by cengiz under after coming off the bench after the break. ""from a tactical point of view, italy was superior,"" said gunes.

2021-06-12,Students from Singapore could be given priority in pilot scheme for possible air travel bubble with Australia.,"singapore: students from singapore could be given priority to travel to australia to pursue or complete their studies when the infrastructure for safe travel is in place, said australian prime minister scott morrison on thursday (jun 10). speaking at a joint press conference with mr morrison following the in-person leaders' meeting that took place earlier on thursday, prime minister lee hsien loong said the two discussed how two-way travel between the countries can eventually resume in a safe and calibrated manner ""when both sides are ready"". this can ""start small"" with an air travel bubble ""when ready"", said mr lee in his statement, which was broadcast live on his facebook page. ""we need to prepare the infrastructure and processes to get ready to do this.  it starts with mutual recognition of health and vaccination certificates, possibly in a digital form.  when all the preparations are ready, we can start small with an air travel bubble to build confidence on both sides,"" he added. there is still some time before singapore and australia ""reach that milestone"", but the two countries will be ""getting on with the job"" of putting systems in place that will enable such a bubble to emerge between singapore and australia, similar to the one between australia and new zealand, said mr morrison. ""but in addition to that . . .  giving priority to students from singapore to be able to return to australia to complete their studies and to engage in their studies,"" he added. ""and for the students from singapore . . .  a first opportunity to see increased travel between australia and singapore realised, and for that to occur sooner rather than later. ""this is the sixth singapore-australia leaders' meeting.  mr lee and mr morrison held their previous meeting in march last year by video conference because of the covid-19 pandemic. mr morrison's trip to singapore is the first official visit by a foreign leader since the start of the pandemic. travel bubble conditionsresponding to a question following the prime ministers' statements, mr morrison said singapore is the first country outside of new zealand that australia wishes to engage in a travel bubble with. adding that australia's system for digital vaccination certificates had just gone live, he said: ""and we get it right in singapore, which we know we can do, because of the very sophisticated systems that singapore has. """"and with some encouragement from prime minister lee, we really do want to focus on those students coming . . .  as part of the exercise piloting how these systems can work most effectively when we get to the next phase . . .  but the timing of that is still somewhere away. """"quite a number"" of students from singapore study in australia and some students came home due to the covid-19 pandemic, said mr lee. these students in singapore are unable to go back to australia to resume their studies, and ""there's urgency for them"", he added. ""especially for those of them who have got clinical attachments or postings, and to be unable to take them up, it's very, very disruptive to their studies. ""mr lee said he also suggested to mr morrison that these students could be one way to test the safe travel systems and ""get a pilot going so that we can widen the project"", and later on implement a full travel bubble between singapore and australia. ""there's no timetable, but we hope it can be done as soon as possible. ""vaccination rates and covid-19 transmission rates will be considered when setting up the travel bubble, said mr lee during the press conference. ""i would say that in singapore, we are making good progress with our vaccination program.  in australia, they're also steadily vaccinating the population.  and i think once the majority of the population is vaccinated, it becomes much easier for us to contemplate these openings,"" he added. the prevailing transmission rates will ""certainly be a factor"", said mr lee. ""what we want to do is to get the preconditions infrastructure ready, the vaccine recognition, what are the standards, what are the conditions.  then the actual decision to do it, that is a political decision.  but let's get everything teed up, so that we are in the position to make the political decision when we want to do so,"" he added. neither singapore nor australia has identified a benchmark vaccination rate that would influence the decision on an air travel bubble, said mr morrison, adding that this would be dependent on the advice of the medical community. defence and fintech partnershipsaddressing other areas of partnership between singapore and australia, mr lee noted that the two countries' treaty on military training and training area development came into force in december 2020. ""this was a milestone in our longstanding defence partnership,"" he added. ""singapore greatly appreciates australia's generous and sustained support for saf's training.  over many years, in many air bases and camps all over australia. ""the bilateral digital economy agreement between the two countries also came into force in 2020, said mr lee. ""this was the fruit of our forward looking, open and progressive attitudes towards trade and the future economy,"" he added. building on the agreement, the two leaders will commence discussions to develop a fintech bridge between the two countries, said mr lee in his opening remarks. singapore and australia are also exploring collaborations on low-emissions solutions to support climate change efforts, said mr lee. ""this is another key domestic priority for both of us, and it includes a public-private partnership on low emissions fuels and technologies for shipping and port operations, based at nanyang technological university's eco labs. ""we are also exploring a broader partnership on a green economy agreement.  this will facilitate trade and investment in environmentally sustainable goods and services, and strengthen environmental governance and our capacity to address climate change.

2021-06-12,COVID-19: Malaysia's total lockdown extended for two weeks until Jun 28.,"kuala lumpur: malaysia's movement control order, known as mco 3. 0, will be extended for another two weeks from jun 15 to jun 28. senior minister for defence ismail sabri yaakob announced in a statement on friday (jun 11) that the decision to extend the mco 3. 0 was made as daily case numbers still exceeded 5,000. ""the positive/negative list (permitted and prohibited activities) and standard operating procedures (sops) for every manufacturing, business and industrial activity still remains as announced before this,"" he said after attending a national security council meeting. in may, a nationwide mco was re-imposed in malaysia amid a third wave of covid-19 cases. known as mco 3. 0, all economic sectors were allowed to operate during the period but cross-district and interstate travel as well as social, sports and educational activities were prohibited. stricter restrictions on the economic and social sectors were later announced on may 21 as community cases continued to rise.  the emergence of new variants have also delayed efforts to flatten the infection curve, the prime minister's office had said. on may 28, prime minister muhyiddin yassin announced that the country would go intototal lockdownfor 14 days beginning jun 1, with only essential economic and service sectors allowed to carry on with their operations. case number breached the 9,000-mark on may 29, before the lockdown measures brought daily infections down gradually.  on friday, a total of 6,846 cases were reported. if the first phase of total lockdown could reduce the number of daily cases, then the country would ease into a four-week second phase, where more economic sectors would be allowed to reopen. phase 3 would be similar to the movement control order (mco) that has been enforced in the country, where nearly all economic sectors are allowed to operate with strict sops. the progression from one phase to another would be subject to the ministry of health's risk assessments. as of friday, malaysia's national covid-19 tally stood at 646,411. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

""it underscores the government's belief that the fitness sector is an important one, and we can get back to getting people back in our gyms and studios to resume their fitness regimens. ""he added that the extension of the job support scheme (jss) to help sectors that are required to remain closed till june 20 was helpful and was welcome by those in the industry. 
the affected sectors will receive 10 per cent jss support from june 21 to 30. when indoor activities in gyms and fitness studios are allowed to resume, staff from these places where clients are unmasked will be required to undergo regular covid-19 testing.  this is part of the regular fast and easy testing regimen for staff involved in ""higher-risk mask-off"" activities, which will be introduced in july to reduce transmission during phase three (heightened alert). tan acknowledged that it was something the industry would have to abide by in order for businesses to reopen and believes that it would give members the confidence to return to gyms.  but while the government will cover the cost of testing over the next three months, he expressed concerns about the added costs for gyms and fitness studios beyond that as they have already seen their revenues heavily impacted by the pandemic. the operating costs for many outfits have already increased due to enhanced cleaning, disinfecting and sanitisation measures. he added: ""we hope that the testing costs will not be prohibitive, and that there can be more support for these costs. ""mass participatory sports events such as runs could also be allowed to resume from june 21, with a maximum of 250 participants if pre-event testing is implemented.  if participants are not tested before the event, only 50 people will be allowed to take part. from next monday, spectators will be allowed to return to sports events such as football's singapore premier league or mixed martial arts outfit one championship's shows.  the number of spectators will be capped at 250 attendees with pre-event testing, while no testing is required for events with 50 or fewer attendees. a spokesman from the football association of singapore said: ""as the spl is only due to resume next month, the football association of singapore will continue to monitor prevailing measures in place and will decide the conditions for re-entry of spl fans into match venues closer to the league's resumption period.

2021-06-12,WP’s Jamus Lim says Progressive Wage Model is a “substantial progress” to improve welfare of locals; cautions other prices will increase.,"the workers' party (wp) member of parliament (mp) for sengkang grc jamus lim took to facebook on wednesday (9 june) to share his views on the government's latest announcement of increasing the wages for cleaners in singapore. on monday (7 june), the government revealed that the salaries of cleaners who are singaporeans and permanent resident (pr) will go up each year over six years from 2023, under the progressive wage model (pwm). based on pwm, the increase will be for cleaners across all job levels and it will rise up to between s$1,570 and s$2,210 in 2023.  the amount will subsequently increase by at least s$170 yearly until 2028. for example, a full-time general or indoor cleaner will be entitled for a monthly wage of s$1,570 in july 2023.  this means the worker gets a pay hike of s$258, which is nearly 20 percent increase from the recommended salary of s$1,312 in 2022. commenting about the pwm, mr lim said it is will affect the salary structures of about 30,000 workers. ""this new policy specifies different wage progression paths for different categories.  by 2028, the lowest-wage category will have a gross pay of s$2,420, which will be above the #workersparty universal minimum wage (mw) call of s$1,300 take-home full-time equivalent,"" the mp noted. however, he expressed that his main issue with the pwm is on how slow it has been rolled-out, as well as its lack of guarantee that the minimum wage of those in the lowest-wage sector/category will hit the s$1,300 take-home amount. ""in other words, we should get the minimum wage bit of the so-called minimum wage-plus (mw+) model—what senior minister tharman called the pwm—right.  then tinker with productivity ladders, increments, whatnot.  don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. ""so, i view this implementation of pwm as substantial progress (no pun intended) that will improve the welfare of singaporeans and permanent residents.  this, of course, has been the premise behind fighting for minimum wages all along,"" stated mr lim. if that's not all, the progressive salary increment of cleaners would also mean that other prices will go up, said the alternative party member. ""from a town council perspective, future contract bids will be higher, which could affect town council finances and impact s&cc charges (fortunately, we are locked into contracts for around 3/4 #sengkanggrc divisions),"" he explained. but, this is a good thing for the society because minimum wages help ""correct imbalances in employer-employee bargaining power"", the politician said. ""the small increase in prices that everyone pays vastly improves the lives of low wage, essential workers.  moreover, higher prices can beget quality.  we often think of how, if workers raise their productivity, this will beget higher wages.  but it could happen the other way round: when wages rise, it spurs investments that foster productivity, which in turn boosts quality,"" he expressed. he continued, ""i hope that we can implement the mw+ model to even more sectors, and phase in changes more quickly.  still, we should recognize this policy move for what it is: a genuine step in the right direction, along the lines of what the #workersparty has sought.  #makingyourvotecount.

2021-06-12,Commentary: A precious chance to see my ageing mother in Germany after being separated by COVID-19.,"the pandemic has been particularly cruel to families separated by distance – with borders closed and travel tedious and costly, some never have the chance to hold their loved ones.  greg lim-lange is glad he had the chance. singapore: it is not normal for a son to ask: ""when is my mother going to die?"" or ""will i be able to see her before the inevitable fate that awaits us all sooner or later?""but i have had to ask this difficult question because like many people, i live thousands of miles away from my mother. i have lived here for 12 years, while my mother, who turns 85 this year, lives in germany. since the beginning of the pandemic, my singaporean wife and i had been waiting for countries to control the virus, for travel to ""normalise"", and to able to fly and meet her. but by may 2021, i hadn't seen her in almost two years. for those of us separated from families, there were windows of hope that could have enabled a trip home relatively low covid-19 numbers in singapore, a potential travel bubble via hong kong where business opportunities there mean we can avoid a lengthy quarantine after spending some time there, and vaccines being rapidly developed. but not only did numbers increase, the travel bubble burst twice, dashing many hopes.  the fluidity in the covid-19 situation has meant unpredictable changes to travel restrictions since last year. at the height of the pandemic for instance, singapore closed its borders to all short-term visitors.  this year, when the mutant strains raised infection numbers again, singaporeans and permanent residents had to test negative before flying back. even if we took the risk to travel, there was a nagging fear – what if during my travel, i catch the virus and then bring it home to my mum? or what if i pass it on to my wife? how long should i wait before it is safe – knowing that there would never really be a ""right time""?taking the risk to travelthe good news is vaccinations became available and my mother was first in line to receive her shots in freiburg, a small city nestled in the black forest in the south of germany.  i myself got fully vaccinated by may. the possibility of a trip came into sharper focus.  however, there were still logistical challenges and uncertainties involved in making the trip. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid. should i go alone or go together with my wife?  what if there is another outbreak and singapore changes entry re-entry requirements? how about work – we could not be away indefinitely and needed contingency plans. my wife and i decided to travel together.  it helped that we are self-employed and could do some work remotely. yet, shortly after we booked our tickets and just days before our departure, things took a turn for the worse.  germany went into a hard lockdown as numbers there spiralled.  the new and more contagious variants of the virus also arrived in singapore. germany required a negative pre-flight covid-19 test no earlier than 48 hours before arrival. with pcr tests taking up to two days to process, we scheduled not one but two tests to be taken just in case of a rare false positive.  it would be terrible to have come this far and then be turned around at the airport before we could enter germany. meanwhile the new restrictions in germany to stop transmission meant that all restaurants, shops, and hotels were closed and there was even a curfew in place from 10pm to 6am every night.  so again, there was the concern of being infected and the thought of whether we should still go or postpone came to mind. we had just 12 hours to decide.  all our covid-19 tests had come back negative and we stuck to what mattered most – using this opportunity to see my mother, who had been waiting for two years to be reunited with us. an eerie journeyit was an eerie journey through empty hallways at changi airport with personnel in full ppe, and always a niggling concern in the back of my mind whether we would be let through the immigration controls in germany. with a pandemic that throws up spikes in cases without warning, what was the chance of new regulations mid-flight barring all visitors or new quarantine requirements which so far had not been the case in germany?perhaps it was good that our anxieties were also hidden behind our masks that we were required to wear for the entire flight except for mealtimes.   this clearly wasn't joyful travelling as it used to be. in the end, the journey there went smoothly, the immigration officer glanced at our test results and apologised for the new restrictions and we got through immigration within minutes.  after a two-and-a-half-hour ride on a strangely empty autobahn, we arrived at my mother's home. she burst into tears of joy hugging me tightly after being separated for so long and my wife caught this moment of pure joy on camera. our journey to germany really brought home the point that we are wired to connect with our loved ones physically.  no video call can ever replace the feeling of being held by a loved one or the taste of a mother's meal. my mother had already been cooking our favourite dishes for a week before we arrived in anticipation. the return journeyonly a few days after arriving in germany, the compulsory 14-day quarantine in singapore was changed to 21 days. then there was a big cluster at changi airport and we started to worry if the airport might be closed under a new circuit breaker.  the following week we learned that non- singaporeans or prs would not be allowed to re-enter singapore until august. for some of our international friends currently travelling, that meant that they could not even return to their business or loved ones in singapore. my wife and i remained apprehensive about our journey home – our children were waiting for us.  we kept checking online if any new requirements cropped up before boarding our flight home. we made it back safely and changi airport was even emptier than we remembered.  well-organised as always, immigration and testing upon arrival went quite smoothly as a small army of helpful guides walked alongside us and directed us to every station we needed to pass, from immigration to swab test to our shuttle bus. was this arduous journey filled with twists, turns and worries worth it?i would say yes – my time with my mother was so very precious.  the two weeks we were there went by so quickly.  i didn't have the courage to tell her how much death was on my mind or how my fears of uncertainty were bothering me. i simply stayed with her, listened to her, ate all her lovingly prepared dishes and held her tight. i know we are very privileged to be able to spend the time and the money needed to see our loved ones. my heart goes out to the many more who are stuck in this pandemic limbo with one lockdown after another, still connecting using technology and yearning for the time they can take a trip to finally hold each other again. dr gregor lim-lange is the co-founder and chief psychologist of forest wolf an expert on clinical and positive psychology, social emotional intelligence and mental health.

2021-06-12,"'I can't meet my friends with benefits': Singaporeans spill about their sex lives during Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) , Lifestyle News.","with schools moving to home-based learning, the dining-in prohibition, and social gatherings being capped at two people during phase 2 (heightened alert), we've had fewer reasons to head out and more reasons to stay in. but has this led to more couples getting it on? going off all the condom hoarding going on during last year's circuit breaker period, you might expect a spike in bedroom activity this time around too. well, according to a straw poll conducted by asiaone of 16 sexually active adults between the ages of 18 and 44, that might not necessarily be the case — only 12 respondents said that they are still sexually active during this period.  of those who are sexually active, though, some have seen an improvement in their sex lives thanks to a surge in sexual activity.   one such individual is damien*, who went from having sex once a week to getting at it daily. attributing the change in behaviour to ""boredom"", damien shared that in general, he has a neutral stance towards sex and does not feel like it is a crucial factor in the relationship.  but with the increase in sex, his relationship with his partner has become stronger during this period, he said.  [[nid:529380]]another respondent whose sex life has improved is sharon*, who feels like the pandemic has given her more opportunities to spend time with her partner. she shared that to her, sex is ""essential and intimate, as it's something you only share with someone you're in a relationship with"". overall, the amount of sex she has with her partner hasn't changed and they're still doing it around twice a week.  however, she said that with ""less face-to-face work and social obligations"", they have ""more time to focus on each other"", which translates to better sex. unfortunately, not everyone shares the same sentiments.  around a quarter of our respondents noted deterioration in their sex lives ever since phase 2 (heightened alert) kicked in. one such individual is jazymn*, who cites her hectic work schedule and rising stress levels as a reason.  while she and her partner still are sexually active, their quality of sex has dropped thanks to the stressors brought on by the pandemic. and couples aren't the only ones who are struggling.  lisa*, who is not in a relationship, told us that the pandemic has affected her sex life too. to her, sex is all about the ""fun and pleasure"".  prior to phase 2 (heightened alert), she would have sex around thrice a week with her friends with benefits.  sadly, when the new restrictions kicked in, this meant less sex for her. ""i can't meet my friends with benefits as much,"" she said. while having less sex has left some of our respondents unsatisfied, others are pretty chill about the situation. singles like h* and wn* don't think of sex as a huge priority and to h, ""sex is just a way to relieve stress"", so he isn't too fussed about how often he gets to engage in the act. for him, it all depends on ""the availabilities of [his] friends with benefits"". when asked about how his sex life has been affected during phase 2 (heightened alert), wn, who is single, simply said: ""it depends on who i manage to get. "" and for some, the physical connection isn't the only thing that has gone through changes during this period — the emotional aspect of the relationship feels different too. [[nid:524562]]take felicia*, for example.  she told us she still has sex with her partner once a week, and overall, their sex life has remained pretty much the same.  however, when it comes to the emotional part of their relationship, she feels that the pandemic has actually helped to improve their connection and they've ""become closer"". bob* is another individual who said that spending more time at home has not changed the amount of sex he gets, and he still does so once a week. however, his situation is quite the opposite of felicia's. ""spending more time together than usual results in more opportunities but less excitement,"" he admitted. apart from that, there are other issues for him to deal with. ""my 'working spouse' appears to be a different person,"" he confessed when asked about how the pandemic has affected his relationship. but at the end of the day, it all boils down to adapting to the new norm and riding through these hard times. one such couple who have managed to do so is nicholas* and his girlfriend.  while they now have fewer opportunities to meet and spend time together, the decrease in sex does not bother them whatsoever. instead, they make up for the lack of physical intimacy by gaming and meeting more often online. in these extraordinary, fluid times where things are always changing, it's important to be able to react and adapt to new and different situations.  while it definitely isn't easy, it's heartening to know that we're not alone. *not their real

2021-06-12,Working from home to remain as default; Jobs Support Scheme extended for certain sectors.,"singapore: working from home will remain the default arrangement, even as singapore transitions to phase 3 (heightened alert) in the coming weeks. ""employers should ensure that employees who are able to work from home continue to do so,"" said co-chair of the covid-19 multi-ministry task force lawrence wong on thursday's (jun 10) press conference. ""we think that's still necessary in order to minimise movement and to minimise risk,"" he said. companies should continue to stagger start times of employees and implement flexible working hours, said mr wong, who is also the finance minister. workers also should not be cross-deployed to multiple worksites, added the ministry of health (moh) in a press release on thursday. the government announced on may 14 thatworking from home will become the default for workplacesafter a spike in covid-19 community infections.  it was part of a slew of measures under phase 2 (heightened alert) aimed at bringing down the number of cases. on when people will be allowed to resume working from offices, mr wong said on thursday that authorities will take a ""phased approach"". ""the embers are still there, we do not want to encourage too much movement.  we resume activities progressively but we do not want everything to happen all at the same time,"" he said. the government will monitor the situation over the coming weeks, the minister said.  should cases remain ""generally low and under control"", vaccination rates rise and a ""good and comprehensive testing regime"" is in place, it may reconsider its position on working from home, he added. jobs support scheme extendedthe jobs support scheme (jss), which subsidies local workers' salaries, will be extended for certain sectors that are required to remain closed until jun 20, said mr wong. this is part of the staggered reopening under phase 3 (heightened alert), where some sectors will not be allowed to reopen until jun 21. they will receive 10 per cent jss support from jun 21 to jun 30. activities reopening on jun 21 include dining-in at f&b establishments, live performances, mask-off sports activities at gyms and fitness studios and in-person tuition and enrichment classes. for taxi and private-hire drivers, the covid-19 driver relief fund will be extended for three more months at s$300 per month per vehicle for two months and s$150 for per vehicle for the next one month. the continued support adds up to s$40 million and will help more than 50,000 taxi and private hire car drivers, said the land transport authority.  on top of this, taxi operators have pledged to continue providing rental waivers of at least s$12 million during this three-month extension of the support scheme. regular testing for staff in unmasked activitiespeople who work in high-risk settings with unmasked customers will have to undergo regular covid-19 testing, regardless of their vaccination status. this includes staff of dine-in f&b outlets, personal care and appearance services that require removal of masks such as facials, saunas and make-up services, and gym and fitness studios where clients are unmasked. mandatory tests will be progressively rolled out to larger establishments first and extended to smaller businesses after.  for dine-in f&b outlets, testing will be rolled out starting from next month. the capacity for the fast and easy testing regime will be ""aggressively ramped up"" in the coming months, moh said.  tests such as the antigen rapid test will be used. the cost of the tests will be covered by the government for the next three months, said mr wong.  this is in view of the heightened alert period and that people, especially those in high-risk settings, are tested frequently, he said. ""beyond that, i think employers themselves will have to start thinking about incorporating these processes as part of their business continuity plans,"" he said. more details of the mandatory testing will be announced later, the health ministry said. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-12,Commentary: The merits of Singapore’s new carbon trading marketplace.,"climate impact x is a welcome addition to the country's climate action initiatives that provide new economic opportunities, help price discovery and can aid future compliance, say energy researchers. singapore: singapore took another big step in advancing the green agenda last month. the country on may 20 announced plans to position itself as a hub for carbon services. climate impact x (cix) is a joint venture between the development bank of singapore, singapore exchange, standard chartered bank and temasek holdings. first envisioned by the emerging stronger taskforce's alliance for action on sustainability, cix will provide a marketplace for trading carbon credits commencing in late 2021. singapore is well-suited to hosting a carbon marketplace.  it is an ideal base for multinational companies working on projects that generate emission credits across the region. as a regional leader for commodities trading, singapore also deals with many energy majors and traders who will form a large part of the clientele for carbon market ancillary services. there are already around 30 firms here offering carbon consulting services, which include low-carbon project development, consulting and verification for the registration of certified emissions-reduction credits, carbon footprint measurement, project financing and legal services. the launch of a carbon marketplace can attract more of such consultancies in a key growth industry. (what will cix bring to the table of carbon trading and climate action? find out on the climate conversations. )a welcome addition to singapore's climate action initiativescix is a welcome addition to the suite of emission-cutting initiatives and institutions in singapore that helps the country accelerate its peak and net-zero emissions timelines. under the paris agreement, singapore'snationally determined contributionis to peak emissions at 65 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent around 2030.  singapore also seeks to halve peak emissions to 33 million tonnes by 2050 and achieve net zero emissions as soon as viable during the second half of the century. a key innovation of cix includes provisions for trading nature-based solutions. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid. nature-based climate solutions like mangroves, wetlands and forests can absorb vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. a recent study by researchers at the nus centre for nature-based climate solutions estimates reforestation in southeast asia can contribute to 3. 4 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions reductions per year.  reforestation, coupled with supply chain transparency and harmonised standards for carbon offsets, can translate into a ready source of carbon credits. as an exchange focused on such carbon credits, cix will enhance the climate finance ecosystem within singapore and expand the range of mechanisms for firms to manage and price their carbon externalities.  google, microsoft and amazon are said to be in talks to use cix in their journey to become net-zero emitters. moreover, it offers another way for singapore to widen the international scope of its environmental management activities. the right price for carboncix can aid with the adjustment of singapore's carbon tax – which came into effect in january 2019 – by expanding the array of tools used for pricing carbon in singapore. this will permit the singapore government some freedom when discussing future, probably upward revision to the current tax, since local firms will have the ability to defray their ""carbon costs"" in other ways. the current tax rate of s$5 per tonne of co2 can be contested for three reasons.  first, the abatement costs are typically considered much higher, and ideally, carbon price would reflect the cost of abatement.  a world bank report published in may notes that a price of us$40 to us$80 (s$50 to s$100) per tonne of co2 is needed to meet the 2 degrees celsius goal. second, the s$5 price tag might not fully capture carbon embedded in international supply chains and trade. this has spurred debate around the need for carbon border adjustment mechanisms – a tool for ensuring that domestic and imported goods price their embodied emissions equally, thereby discouraging trade with high-polluting countries that do not have effective carbon pricing mechanisms of their own. third, singapore's carbon pricing is arguably not a sufficiently liquid mechanism because it changes infrequently. the government has plans to increase the tax rate to between s$10 and s$15 per tonne by 2030.  the tax level and trajectory post-2023 will be reviewed by 2022, in consultation with industry and expert groups in order to give businesses and opportunity to adjust to changes. there is wisdom in introducing market-based mechanisms to facilitate the price discovery process and allow emissions to be priced into commercial decisions. in the absence of such a mechanism, finding the right price for carbon is complex.  it requires striking a balance between reducing the carbon footprint of industries and increasing the costs of doing business, which may negatively impact the competitiveness of singapore's economy. however, with the pandemic still evolving, the success of singapore's carbon services hub should not be assumed.  increased and quantifiable demand for carbon offsets also suggest an upward trend in emissions-intensive activities in the near term. getting companies to play ballthe cix is also a first step to getting companies to play ball on singapore's climate obligations. demand for carbon offsets could arise from several sources.  companies currently paying carbon taxes may purchase credits to defray their carbon tax liability. similarly, firms or other speculators may purchase credits to trade later for a premium, should this be allowed under the carbon pricing act. retail trade from individuals seeking socially responsible investment options can also be expected. yet singapore must not forget there are no industry-level mandatory reduction targets.  many carbon commitments by corporations in the region are currently voluntary, which may limit market participation. regulation can steward strong market participation.  with rapid global expansion of climate finance, compliance concerns have also grown because of ""greenwash"" – when companies over-inflate the environmental credentials of their projects. the devil is in the details.  regulators must provide robust mechanisms for project verification, monitoring and compliance enforcement not only to prevent greenwash, but also to ensure fair benchmarking across all projects. this could be industry initiated, where carbon credit and offset suppliers commit to co-develop and implement greenhouse gas quantification and reporting methodologies for their respective sectors.  regulators will then be able to assess the methodologies that improve transparency in carbon credit transactions. having recognised the complexity of scaling up global carbon markets, the global institute on finance's taskforce on scaling voluntary carbon markets has launched a consultation on creating ""high-integrity"" markets, due to end in late june.  it seeks to establish ""a threshold standard for high-quality credits, clear legal standards and uniting existing, fragmented carbon credit markets in one impactful, well-run system"". to ensure the integrity and quality of its credits, cix will work with global partners including the taskforce on scaling voluntary carbon markets and the natural climate solutions alliance. it will also use cutting-edge data analytics, such as satellite monitoring, machine learning and blockchain technology to ensure the environmental integrity of credits traded on cix. global rating agencies might be roped in to provide independent environmental ratings for nature-based projects which will issue carbon credits. it is important singapore provides a well-run and trusted market for carbon offsets while expanding emissions-reduction efforts. however, to meet its own national targets, companies must ultimately commit to less carbon-intensive production models and not simply ""pay to play"" by exploiting offsets. melissa low is research fellow at the energy studies institute, national university of singapore.  david

opportunities, help price discovery and can aid future compliance, say energy researchers."", 'singapore: singapore took another big step in advancing the green agenda last month.', 'the country on may 20 announced plans to position itself as a hub for carbon services.', 'climate impact x (cix) is a joint venture between the development bank of singapore, singapore exchange, standard chartered bank and temasek holdings.', ""first envisioned by the emerging stronger taskforce's alliance for action on sustainability, cix will provide a marketplace for trading carbon credits commencing in late 2021. singapore is well-suited to hosting a carbon marketplace."", 'it is an ideal base for multinational companies working on projects that generate emission credits across the region.', 'as a regional leader for commodities trading, singapore also deals with many energy majors and traders who will form a large part of the clientele for carbon market ancillary services.', 'there are already around 30 firms here offering carbon consulting services, which include low-carbon project development, consulting and verification for the registration of certified emissions-reduction credits, carbon footprint measurement, project financing and legal services.', 'the launch of a carbon marketplace can attract more of such consultancies in a key growth industry.', '(what will cix bring to the table of carbon trading and climate action?', 'find out on the climate conversations.', "")a welcome addition to singapore's climate action initiativescix is a welcome addition to the suite of emission-cutting initiatives and institutions in singapore that helps the country accelerate its peak and net-zero emissions timelines."", ""under the paris agreement, singapore'snationally determined contributionis to peak emissions at 65 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent around 2030.  singapore also seeks to halve peak emissions to 33 million tonnes by 2050 and achieve net zero emissions as soon as viable during the second half of the century."", 'a key innovation of cix includes provisions for trading nature-based solutions.', 'it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.', 'nature-based climate solutions like mangroves, wetlands and forests can absorb vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.', 'a recent study by researchers at the nus centre for nature-based climate solutions estimates reforestation in southeast asia can contribute to 3.', '4 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions reductions per year.', 'reforestation, coupled with supply chain transparency and harmonised standards for carbon offsets, can translate into a ready source of carbon credits.', 'as an exchange focused on such carbon credits, cix will enhance the climate finance ecosystem within singapore and expand the range of mechanisms for firms to manage and price their carbon externalities.', 'google, microsoft and amazon are said to be in talks to use cix in their journey to become net-zero emitters.', 'moreover, it offers another way for singapore to widen the international scope of its environmental management activities.', ""the right price for carboncix can aid with the adjustment of singapore's carbon tax – which came into effect in january 2019 – by expanding the array of tools used for pricing carbon in singapore."", 'this will permit the singapore government some freedom when discussing future, probably upward revision to the current tax, since local firms will have the ability to defray their ""carbon costs"" in other ways.', 'the current tax rate of s$5 per tonne of co2 can be contested for three reasons.', 'first, the abatement costs are typically considered much higher, and ideally, carbon price would reflect the cost of abatement.', 'a world bank report published in may notes that a price of us$40 to us$80 (s$50 to s$100) per tonne of co2 is needed to meet the 2 degrees celsius goal.', 'second, the s$5 price tag might not fully capture carbon embedded in international supply chains and trade.', 'this has spurred debate around the need for carbon border adjustment mechanisms – a tool for ensuring that domestic and imported goods price their embodied emissions equally, thereby discouraging trade with high-polluting countries that do not have effective carbon pricing mechanisms of their own.', ""third, singapore's carbon pricing is arguably not a sufficiently liquid mechanism because it changes infrequently."", 'the government has plans to increase the tax rate to between s$10 and s$15 per tonne by 2030.  the tax level and trajectory post-2023 will be reviewed by 2022, in consultation with industry and expert groups in order to give businesses and opportunity to adjust to changes.', 'there is wisdom in introducing market-based mechanisms to facilitate the price discovery process and allow emissions to be priced into commercial decisions.', 'in the absence of such a mechanism, finding the right price for carbon is complex.', ""it requires striking a balance between reducing the carbon footprint of industries and increasing the costs of doing business, which may negatively impact the competitiveness of singapore's economy."", ""however, with the pandemic still evolving, the success of singapore's carbon services hub should not be assumed."", 'increased and quantifiable demand for carbon offsets also suggest an upward trend in emissions-intensive activities in the near term.', ""getting companies to play ballthe cix is also a first step to getting companies to play ball on singapore's climate obligations."", 'demand for carbon offsets could arise from several sources.', 'companies currently paying carbon taxes may purchase credits to defray their carbon tax liability.', 'similarly, firms or other speculators may purchase credits to trade later for a premium, should this be allowed under the carbon pricing act.', 'retail trade from individuals seeking socially responsible investment options can also be expected.', 'yet singapore must not forget there are no industry-level mandatory reduction targets.', 'many carbon commitments by corporations in the region are currently voluntary, which may limit market participation.', 'regulation can steward strong market participation.', 'with rapid global expansion of climate finance, compliance concerns have also grown because of ""greenwash"" – when companies over-inflate the environmental credentials of their projects.', 'the devil is in the details.', 'regulators must provide robust mechanisms for project verification, monitoring and compliance enforcement not only to prevent greenwash, but also to ensure fair benchmarking across all projects.', 'this could be industry initiated, where carbon credit and offset suppliers commit to co-develop and implement greenhouse gas quantification and reporting methodologies for their respective sectors.', 'regulators will then be able to assess the methodologies that improve transparency in carbon credit transactions.', 'having recognised the complexity of scaling up global carbon markets, the global institute on finance\'s taskforce on scaling voluntary carbon markets has launched a consultation on creating ""high-integrity"" markets, due to end in late june.', 'it seeks to establish ""a threshold standard for high-quality credits, clear legal standards and uniting existing, fragmented carbon credit markets in one impactful, well-run system"".', 'to ensure the integrity and quality of its credits, cix will work with global partners including the taskforce on scaling voluntary carbon markets and the natural climate solutions alliance.', 'it will also use cutting-edge data analytics, such as satellite monitoring, machine learning and blockchain technology to ensure the environmental integrity of credits traded on cix.', 'global rating agencies might be roped in to provide independent environmental ratings for nature-based projects which will issue carbon credits.', 'it is important singapore provides a well-run and trusted market for carbon offsets while expanding emissions-reduction efforts.', 'however, to meet its own national targets, companies must ultimately commit to less carbon-intensive production models and not simply ""pay to play"" by exploiting offsets.', 'melissa low is research fellow at the energy

2021-06-12,"S'pore-HK ATB deferred till Jul, no 'firm plans' for South Korea.","singapore — a review of the proposed singapore-hong kong air travel bubble (atb) is set for early july, said the ministry of transport (mot) on thursday (10 june), after its launch was previously deferred several times.  the launch was deferred from a target date of 26 may following a mutual agreement between minister for transport s iswaran and hong kong secretary for commerce and economic development edward yau, due to the worsening covid-19 situation in singapore. mot noted that the situation in singapore has since improved, with the number of community cases and local unlinked coronavirus cases showing a downward trend.  meanwhile, the situation in hong kong continues to remain stable, with very few community cases over the past few weeks. ""both singapore and hong kong remain strongly committed to launching the atb safely.  we will continue to monitor the public health situation in both places closely,"" said mot. the travel bubble was initially announced on 11 november 2020 to much fanfare, touted as the first of its kind in the region, or even the world.  however, just 10 days later, the original 22 november launch was suspended for two weeks due to a surge in covid-19 cases in hong kong. it was later delayed indefinitely on 1 december ""in view of the severity of the epidemic situation in hong kong with the number of local cases of unknown sources increasing rapidly,"" said the hong kong government. separately, health minister ong ye kung, who co-chairs a multi-ministry taskforce on covid-19, told reporters at a virtual press conference that there are no ""firm plans"" for a travel bubble with south korea. ""i think it's actually good to continue discussions with different partners, regions and countries on what are the possibilities going ahead, but as of now i don't think there are any firm plans. ""ong was responding to a question about reports that south korea aims to expedite travel bubble talks with singapore to allow quarantine-free travel for fully vaccinated people from as early as july.  ong, who was previously transport minister, noted that the term ""travel bubble"" has often been loosely used.  in the case of singapore and hong kong, they are two ""very safe regions"" that want to form a free travel area, which involves pre-departure testing and on-arrival testing, without any quarantine when passengers arrive, ong said.  ""in the case of south korea, i believe the concept has been a vaccinated travel bubble, which means if both regions have managed their infections up to a very low level. . . and they are confident that if travellers are vaccinated, it's safe enough to travel with some precautions. ""he added, ""i think these are concepts that we need to think about, for the medium term, and definitely not in this period, when we are just recovering from this wave of transmission and opening up in stages, but i think it's always good that we cast our minds several months down the road, because we do need to live our lives normally and resume normalcy.

""as for sharon, who is back in singapore till august and is currently serving out her quarantine at an orchard road hotel, she recalled her rookie days in showbiz and how zoe looked out for her. she shared: ""when i was a rookie in the industry and had to interview zoe, she knew i was nervous and made extra effort to be affable and reassuring.  now i'm all grown up and she continues to care and encourage.  ""this is why she is our ah jie forever.  thank you for the surprise zoe. ""sharon, 45, also previously shared that zoe's presence at the hotel when she came to deliver the gift and some food caused quite the commotion. based on the instagram tags from the celebrities, it seems that the lingerie might have come from amanda fashion gallery while the perfumes are from f'diary. we reached out to zoe's manager for clarification, and zoe said she is not the brands' ambassador and is only supporting a friend's business. also read: sharon au's serving quarantine at orchard hotel, zoe tay causes 'commotion' after sending food to herbryanlim@asiaone.

2021-06-12,COVID-19 Jabs of Pfizer & Moderna May Lead to Inflamed Heart.,"the covid-19 vaccine task force of the u. s.  centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) stated that it has observed increased cases of heart inflammation in adolescents and younger adults, especially aged 12 to 24, following inoculation with authorized mrna-based covid-19 vaccines from moderna mrna, and pfizer pfe/biontech bntx. several hundreds of cases of myocarditis and pericarditis, both conditions of heart inflammation, were reported to the u. s.  government's vaers (vaccine adverse event reporting system) following dose 1 of any mrna-based vaccine in the last two months.  please note that vaers is a national early warning system to detect possible safety problems in u. s.  licensed vaccines.  the number of cases increased further after the second dose of these vaccines.  moreover, the cases occurred in higher number of younger patients following dose 2 compared to dose 1.  the cdc stated that similar inflammation cases were not reported following vaccination with j&j's jnj adenovirus-based covid-19 vaccine. per a reuters report, the israel's health ministry raised the alarm when it reported a likely link of heart inflammation in young men vaccinated with pfizer's bnt162b earlier this month.  following this report, the cdc and health regulators in other countries started investigating such cases. although the number of reported cases is small compared to total inoculations with mrna vaccines, they were higher than expected in the younger age groups. we note that the cdc is yet to link these adverse events to mrna vaccines and has scheduled a meeting of the advisory committee on immunization practices (acip) on jun 18 to discuss and assess the heart inflammation reports.  moreover, the government authority has recommended continuation of vaccination for everyone of age 12 or older given the risk of covid-19 illness and related complications. however, we note that the cdc report also stated that more than 50% of heart inflammation cases were reported in the age group of 12-24 that has received only 8. 8% of vaccine doses.  this suggests that any adverse outcome from the acip meeting scheduled next week can hamper vaccination with mrna vaccines in the adolescent patient group, and hurt prospects of these vaccine developers.  however, the percentage of inflammation cases suggests that the risk from these vaccines is significantly lower than their benefits.  a cdc study claims that these vaccines are 91% effective.  moreover, most patients facing inflammation issues quickly felt better following medication and rest. we remind investors that pfizer/biontech's covid-19 vaccine received authorization for emergency use in adolescents last month from the fda.  moderna filed for a similar authorization in the united states, europe and canada earlier this month. meanwhile, pfizer and biontech have pledged two billion doses of their covid-19 vaccines to ensure equitable access to their vaccines globally.  as part of the pledge, the company plans to supply 200 million doses in 2021 and 300 million doses in the first half of 2022 to the u. s.  government at not-for-profit price.  the government will donate these doses to low- and lower middle-income countries and organizations that support them. while moderna and pfizer carry a zacks rank #3 (hold), biontech sports a zacks rank of 1 (strong buy).  you can see the complete list of today's zacks #1 rank stocks here. in addition to the stocks you read about above, would you like to see zacks' top picks to capitalize on the internet of things (iot)? it is one of the fastest-growing technologies in history, with an estimated 77 billion devices to be connected by 2025.  that works out to 127 new devices per second. zacks has released a special report to help you capitalize on the internet of things's exponential growth.  it reveals 4 under-the-radar stocks that could be some of the most profitable holdings in your portfolio in 2021 and beyond. click here to download this report free >>want the latest recommendations from zacks investment research? today, you can download 7 best stocks for the next 30 days.  click to get this free report johnson & johnson (jnj) : free stock analysis report pfizer inc.

""enforcement actions will include fines, closures even for first offence, and the revoking of food shop, public entertainment or liquor licences,"" said the ministry. it reminded patrons and operators of f&b establishments to strictly adhere to safe management measures as these places are high-risk settings where coronavirus transmission has taken place in recent weeks. mse also said the national parks board will continue to temporarily close access to some parks and sections of beaches, lawns and facilities such as hardcourts, shelters and carparks when these areas get too crowded or where people remain non-compliant with safe management measures. nparks has advised  compliance with safe management measures on more than 6,000 instances to parkgoers who were not wearing masks, and on more than 800 occasions to people who had gathered in groups of more than two, added the ministry.  these were verbally given by enforcement officers. the latest breach is steamov steamboat buffet restaurant's third offence.  it had allowed customers to dine there at 9. 30pm on may 28. the starz bistro had done so on may 22, and also allowed customers to consume alcohol after 10. 30pm that day. mse said the closure orders for both eateries will take effect when dining in is allowed to resume. it said that agencies have identified places where safe management measures are more frequently breached and have stepped up enforcement presence there. these hot spots includes parks and common areas of housing board estates such as hardcourts, basketball courts and pavilions. ""where repeated breaches of smms have been observed, agencies will close off facilities to ensure the safety of the community,"" added the ministry. for example, a pavilion at block 90 pipit road was cordoned off on may 31 after a group of more than 12 people were found gathering there for dance sessions on multiple occasions.

2021-06-12,Indian state sharply raises COVID-19 death toll prompting call for wide review.,"bengaluru: an indian state has raised its covid-19 death toll sharply higher after the discovery of thousands of unreported cases, lending weight to suspicion that india's overall death tally is significantly more than the official figure. indian hospitals ran out of beds and life-saving oxygen during a devastating second wave of coronavirus in april and may and people died in parking lots outside hospitals and at their homes. many of those deaths were not recorded in covid-19 tallies, doctors and health experts say. india has the second-highest tally of covid-19 infections in the world after the united states, with 29. 2 million cases and 359,676 deaths, according to health ministry data. but the discovery of several thousand unreported deaths in the state of bihar has raised suspicion that many more coronavirus victims have not been included in official figures. the health department in bihar, one of india's poorest states, revised its total covid-19 related death toll to more than 9,429 from about 5,424 on wednesday. the newly reported deaths had occurred last month and state officials were investigating the lapse, a district health official said, blaming the oversight on private hospitals. ""these deaths occurred 15 days ago and were only uploaded now in the government portal.  action will be taken against some of the private hospitals,"" said the official, who declined to be identified as he is not authorised to speak to the media. health experts say they believe both coronavirus infections and deaths are being significantly under-counted across the country partly because test facilities are rare in rural areas, where two-thirds of indians live, and hospitals are few and far between. many people have fallen ill and died at home without being tested for the coronavirus. ""widespread problem""as crematoriums struggled to handle the wave of deaths over the past two months, many families placed bodies in the holy ganges river or buried them in shallow graves on its sandbanks. those people would likely not have been registered as covid-19 victims. ""under-reporting is a widespread problem, not necessarily deliberate, often because of inadequacies,"" rajib dasgupta, head of the centre of social medicine and community health at new delhi's jawaharlal nehru university, told reuters. ""in the rural context, whatever states may say or claim, testing is not simple, easy or accessible,"" dasgupta said. overall, india's cases and deaths have fallen steadily in the past weeks after a surge from mid-march. the official total of cases stood at 29. 2 million on thursday after rising by 94,052 in the previous 24 hours, while total fatalities were at 359,676, according to data from the health ministry. the new york times estimated deaths based on death counts over time and infection fatality rates and put india's toll at 600,000 to 1. 6 million. the government dismissed those estimates as exaggerated.  but the main opposition congress party said that other states must follow bihar's example and conduct a review of deaths over the past two months. ""this proves beyond a doubt government has been hiding covid deaths, "" said shama mohamed, a spokeswoman for congress, adding that an audit should also be ordered in the big states of uttar pradesh, madhya pradesh and gujarat. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

""we will be significantly stepping up enforcement and will take firmer enforcement action for any breaches.  patrons are reminded to keep their masks on at all times, except when eating or drinking,"" moh said. mtf co-chair lawrence wong, who is also finance minister, acknowledged that f&b operators would be disappointed by the prospect of having to wait one more week before they can re-open.  ""i would ask all of them to make use of the one week to really go through their processes, their protocols, make sure that their restaurant layouts comply fully with the rules. . . because we know that these are high risk settings.

""clearly there have been problems with the arrangements with naval group,"" dutton told the australian. ""there has been concern on both sides in relation to the programme and i need to make sure that we have the best capacity available to us. ""australian first discussed replacing its trouble-plagued collins class submarines nearly a decade ago.  the collins submarines were due to be retired in the next few years. the first of australia's six collins-class submarines reaches the end of its lifespan in 2026.  this is several years before the first of the new fleet, a diesel-electric version of naval group's 5,000-tonne barracuda nuclear-powered submarine, is scheduled to be delivered.  the final new submarine will be operational during the 2050s. australia's prime minister scott morrison will meet with french president emmanuel macron next week and the two are expected to discuss the submarine deal. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-12,Phase 3 (Heightened Alert): Encouraging news for gym owners in Singapore.,"singapore – indoor fitness activities will be allowed to resume from 21 june if the covid-19 situation in singapore remains under control in the next few weeks, the multi-ministry taskforce shared in a press conference on thursday (10 june). gyms and fitness studios may resume indoor mask-off sports activities, with safe distancing of at least two metres between persons and at least three metres between groups of up to five persons.  sports classes (both indoors and outdoors) will be capped at 30 persons (including the instructor), comprised of groups of no more than five persons.  class participants may unmask if they are engaging in strenuous activities, although they are strongly encouraged to remain masked where possible to reduce the risk of transmission.  ken mok, the ceo of true group, shared with yahoo lifestyle sea that he was happy to hear the news: ""we are happy and grateful that we can soon welcome our members back to our clubs with appropriate safe distancing measures in place.  while we have been conducting online and outdoor classes that have been very well received, our members have been raring to return to their regular fitness sessions. ""mok added that in line with safe management measures, their clubs are cleaned and sanitised every two hours: ""we are committed to doing our part in keeping singapore safe, and we are waiting to hear from the authorities on the required testing regime.  prior to the recent closures, we clean and sanitise our clubs every two hours, which is above and beyond requirements.  we will continue to do so, and take other active steps to ensure the safety of our team and members. ""as for sarah stuart, owner of the f45 training jurong cbd studio, she remains hopeful about the news. ""we welcome the government's decision to allow indoor activities to resume and are prepared to comply with safe-distancing guidelines to ensure our wider community, including staff and members, remain safe.  as we await further details, we will continue to ensure contactless check-in at studios via our app, and ask all members to use our disinfection station upon entering the studio.  our format also allows for members to work at their own station with all the disinfected equipment they need to avoid sharing with any others,"" said stuart. brad robinson, ceo of boutique gym chain ritual gym singapore, said that his members are itching to get back to a regular fitness routine, which also means ""being able to use fitness equipment and not wearing a mask during exercise. "" ""we are thrilled that restrictions are starting to ease, and that the national measures put in place proved to be effective.  the national vaccination drive along with easier testing options should allow us to get back to business as usual in short to medium term, which is very exciting,"" robinson said upon hearing the positive news. balancing the new normal:sg phase 2 heightened alert: 10 f&b outlets that deliver familiar comfort food to your homesg phase 2 heightened alert: 11 restaurants that deliver a touch of luxe to your doorstepindonesian restaurant the rice table closing down after 24 yearsfoodies rally to patronise ailing elderly hawkers as diners asked to stay homeinterview: royal pek, co-founder of xian dan chao ren — 'i've sacrificed relationships with people i love'watch more yahoo lifestyle videos on yahoo tv:assembly by natasha brown review – a modern mrs dallowaya sparsely written debut about a black woman preparing for a party examines the disorienting experience of assimilation virtuosic debut . . .  natasha brown.  photograph: antonio olmos/the guardianevery year, i take a long walk with friends.  it's one of life's greatest pleasures.  for 16 years, i have met up with five friends for an annual yomp in the english countryside – and we are enjoying that companionship more than everlige nu kan du prøve aktiviva med en introrabat på 50% på første pakke, hvis du tilmelder dig abonnementsordningen – efterfølgende sparer du 20%which girls' name means 'little bear'? the weekend quiz.  from cube-shaped droppings to theological virtues, test your knowledge with the weekend quizhow the word is passed review: after tulsa, other forgotten atrocitiesin his reckoning with the history of slavery across america, clint smith delivers a corrective both necessary and poetic a recreated slave cabin at thomas jefferson's plantation in charlottesville, virginia.  photograph: andrew lichtenstein/corbis via getty imagesfit in my 40s: what next after the couch to 5k app?.  even when i've done the 5k, failed to maintain my prowess peak and slid inexorably back down to couch, i've never thought twice about going back to the appbedste sikkerhed i klassen.  a+ forbrug 19,2 km/l, 117-118 g/km co2.  prisen gælder indregistrering senest 30/06/2021. blind date: 'she said i could be justin trudeau's younger brother'luca, 24, medical librarian, meets charlie, 26, executive assistant luca and charlie: 'we both come from pretty multicultural backgrounds.

""some, such as university student isabel dyason, 22, chose vaccination centres that offer the pfizer-biontech vaccine even though they were farther away from home.  ms dyason, who lives in tampines, booked her first jab on june 25 at bedok community centre. the shorter waiting period between doses for the pfizer-biontech vaccine 21 days against moderna's 28 days also appeals to some, while others said they chose it because more vaccination centres are offering it. there were also those who thought the two vaccines are equally safe and effective, and chose their vaccination centres based on convenience. ms goy shi yi, 32, a communications manager, said: ""i wanted to get it done early and as soon as possible, because the situation may worsen very quickly as we've seen from all the recent clusters. ""she booked a slot for saturday at radin mas community club, which is just a few bus stops from her home. ""i did read up on the differences between moderna and pfizer, but from what i see, they have similar efficacy levels and side effects.  side effects like fever aren't of much concern to me.  if we're talking about rashes or some blood clots, then perhaps i'd be more worried,"" she added. a study, conducted by the united states centres for disease control and prevention and published in the journal of the american medical association in april, found that those who received the moderna vaccine more frequently reported side effects such as redness over the injection site, muscle aches and fevers than those who received the pfizer-biontech vaccine. after the second dose, 74. 8 per cent of moderna recipients reported reactions such as fever, headache and fatigue, compared with 64. 2 per cent of those who received the pfizer-biontech vaccine. associate professor hsu li yang of the national university of singapore saw swee hock school of public health said the reasons for the difference are still unknown. however, in terms of severe or life-threatening side effects, the two vaccines are similar and the risks are very low. ""in fact, the risk of anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) to the moderna vaccine is about half or less than half of the pfizer vaccine,"" he added. dr ling li min, an infectious diseases expert from rophi clinic, said: ""experts conclude that both vaccines are similar and equally good when it comes to efficacy, and that side effects depend more on the person than the shot itself.

""the decision was taken after taking into account daily cases are still over 5,000,"" he said in a statement. datuk seri ismail sabri added that regulations such as bans on inter-district travel, social activities and cuts to workplace staff capacity would continue from the existing lockdown that began on june 1 and was set to expire next monday. ""i hope there is no more confusion on the enforcement of standard operating procedures (sop).  i don't want the public to be affected by misinterpretation of the sops by the authorities,"" he said. the lockdown, which allows only 17 economic sectors to operate, was imposed after a looser movement control order (mco) last month failed to curb malaysia's worst coronavirus wave, with both public and private healthcare resources being overrun by a record number of active cases. instead, may has been the deadliest month so far, logging more than a third of the 3,768 fatalities recorded so far. the health ministry reported 6,849 new cases on friday, the highest this week, bringing the all-time total to 646,411, with a record 912 currently warded in intensive care units. malaysia's lockdown, dubbed a full mco (fmco), would have ended its first phase next monday had the health ministry's risk assessment based on infection rates and hospital capacities deem that the restrictions were successful in reducing the number of infections. the health ministry said on wednesday that the rate of transmission had dipped just below 1. 0 to 0. 96, indicating that the number of new patients daily was decreasing slowly. once malaysia ends the fmco, a second phase lasting four weeks will follow with more economic sectors that do not involve mass gatherings allowed. should the situation continue to improve, malaysia will see a further easing, similar to may's mco, where most economic activities subject to sops and health protocols are allowed while social activities remain banned. however, malaysia's long-term exit strategy from mco restrictions largely revolves around achieving herd immunity before the end of the year. after a slow start, the national covid-19 immunisation programme has steadily increased the rate of doses administered daily, with 157,949 jabbed on thursday.  over 2. 8 million people, or nearly 12 per cent of the adult population, have had at least one dose. ""vaccination has picked up the pace. . .  and it will increase to between 200,000 and 250,000 in july and then hit 300,000 to 400,000 daily,"" said prime minister muhyiddin yassin on friday. malaysia needs to dispense about 200,000 doses daily to inoculate a targeted 80 per cent by the end of the year. the premier called on the public to register for their vaccines, with 13 million, or about 54 per cent of eligible residents, indicating their interest so far. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-12,MOH: Public can purchase COVID-19 antigen rapid test kits for self-testing from pharmacists starting 16 June.,"photo credit: ong ye kung/facebookmembers of the public who wish to get their hands on the covid-19 antigen rapid test (art) kits for self-testing can do so from next wednesday (16 june) onwards as they will be ""sold by pharmacists"", said the ministry of health (moh) on thursday (10 june). it was stated that these self-testing kits, which include abbott panbio covid-19 antigen self-test, quickvue at-home otc covid-19 test, sd biosensor sars-cov-2 antigen self-test nasal and sd biosensor standard q covid-19 ag home test, have been given interim authorisation from the health sciences authority (hsa) to be sold to the general public. moh revealed that these tests will be able to generate results in less than 20 minutes. ""they are simple to use, they can be self-administered.  from next week, jun 16, these kits will be dispensed by pharmacists at selected retail pharmacies.  we will then open up for counter sales at more retail locations progressively,"" said health minister ong ye kung at a multi-ministry task force press conference. for a start, the sales will be limited to 10 art kits per person in order to make sure that there are ""adequate supplies for all"", but once more supplies are made available for retail sales, authorities will ""eventually allow test kits to be freely purchased"", said the health ministry's director of medical services kenneth mak. as singapore prepares to ease some of its covid-19 measures from 14 june, it's important that testing can be done fast, easy and accessible, said mr ong. associate professor mak went on to note that the self-test kits ""complement"" singapore's overall surveillance strategy. ""these fast and easy to use tests allow us to detect infected cases more quickly, in particular among individuals who do not have acute respiratory infection symptoms, but are concerned that they may have been exposed to covid-19,"" he said. for individuals whose test results come out positive on these self-test kits, they should ""immediate approach"" a swab and send home public health preparedness clinic (sash phpc) for a confirmatory polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test, said moh. it added that these individuals will then need to self-isolate until they receive a negative pcr test result. ""individuals who have ari symptoms should continue to visit a doctor for a full diagnosis and pcr test instead of relying on an art self-test kit,"" the ministry said. mr ong also said in a facebook post on thursday (10 june) that these kits are available for sale at watson, guardian and unity outlets. in a separate press release on thursday, the hsa also noted that the self-test kits can be purchased without a doctor's prescription. arts identify the viral proteins in the nasal swab samples of covid-19 positive people and ""usually work best in the early stages of infection"", said the authority. ""in general, arts can achieve a sensitivity of about 80 per cent for cases with higher viral loads and a specificity range of 97 to 100 per cent,"" said the hsa. the authority explained that sensitivity means the test's ability to correctly identify covid-19 in individuals without the disease, meanwhile specificity refers to the test's ability to identify individuals without covid-19. arts have lower sensitivity than pcr tests, and this means that the rapid tests have a ""higher change of false negative results"". all arts come with pamphlets with instructions on how to use, and hsa encouraged consumers to read these carefully before using the tests. ""users should collect their nasal sample using the swab provided in the kit and prepare their nasal sample using the buffer and tube provided. ""once the sample is ready, users should perform the test using the test device and read the results,"" said the authority.  © 2006 2021 the online citizen© 2006 2021 the online

""and it was obvious that even without the emergency, the government could previously handle matters related to fighting the covid-19 pandemic,"" he said. ahmad zahid, who is bagan datuk mp, added that parliament meetings would ensure that the government administration is held accountable through checks and balances. ""umno is of the opinion that the parliament is an important official platform to voice the people's grouses, such as moratorium, increasing price of goods, i-sinar and i-lestari 2. 0 and other assistance for everyone,"" he said, referring to the retirement fund withdrawal programmes. on dr mahathir's proposal to set up a national operations council to take over the country's administration, ahmad zahid said this was not discussed in his meeting with the king. the council, better known by its malay abbreviation mageran, was an emergency administrative body established to restore the rule of law in malaysia after the may 13 racial riots in 1969. the opposition alliance pakatan harapan has rejected the proposal on friday, and reiterated its stance that the state of emergency should end immediately and the parliament should reconvene. meanwhile, the palace said the king is due to meet with the other malay rulers next wednesday for a special discussion on the efforts to fight covid-19 and their implementation during the state of emergency. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

""you cannot play better clay court tennis than this.  it's perfect,"" tweeted andy murray. a 92-minute third set ended with djokovic taking the tiebreak. in a further twist on a dramatic evening, the 5,000 spectators inside court philippe chatrier were allowed to watch the conclusion of the match despite it passing the 11pm covid-19 curfew.

2021-06-12,'Very small risk' of heart inflammation after second dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine: Singapore expert committee.,"six cases, four involving men aged between 18 to 30 years old, have been reported in singapore. singapore: there may be a ""very small risk"" of heart inflammation after the second dose of an mrna covid-19 vaccine, said the government-appointed expert committee on covid-19 vaccination in singapore. in a media release on friday (jun 11), the committee said it is closely monitoring international reports that the second dose of mrna covid-19 vaccines may be associated with a small risk of myocarditis and pericarditis in young men. myocarditis and pericarditis are inflammatory conditions that affect the heart muscles and the outer lining of the heart respectively. increased occurrences of myocarditis and pericarditis after the second dose of mrna covid-19 vaccinations have been observed in israel and the united states, and in adolescents and young men younger than 25 years. singapore uses the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines for its national vaccination programme.  both are mrna-based vaccines. in a separate update, the health sciences authority (hsa) said israel, which uses the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine, recently announced that there may be a probable link between the second dose and the onset of myocarditis in men aged between 16 and 30 years old in its population. the link was found stronger among the younger age group of 16 to 19 years old. while no other country has highlighted a similar causal link to date, the us centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) has reported that it has observed more cases of myocarditis and pericarditis in male patients aged between 16 and 24 years old. ""nonetheless, they have stressed that investigations are ongoing, and they have not made any conclusion about a causal link,"" said hsa. most cases are ""mild"", six such reports received by hsamyocarditis and pericarditis occur more often in men compared to women.  symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath or abnormal heartbeats. most cases are mild and patients recover without the need for significant intervention, nor do they suffer from any long-term effects.  the expert committee added that very rarely, severe cases may result in damage to the heart muscles. the two conditions are separate and distinct from heart attacks, which are caused when the blood flow to the heart is blocked. in singapore, hsa said it has received six such reports as of jun 7.  two of the cases involved a man and a woman older than 40 years old.  the other four cases involved men aged between 18 and 30 years old. ""(the four cases) are at the upper end of the expected range for this age group, based on background incidence rates,"" said hsa. most of the cases were reported to have occurred within a few days after receiving the second dose of the vaccine.  all have recovered or have been discharged well from the hospital. although the local numbers are small, the pattern of occurrence after the second covid-19 vaccine and in young men is consistent with what has been observed in the us and israel, which are the two major users of the mrna vaccines, said hsa. those who developed myocarditis and pericarditis responded well to treatment and recovered, added hsa. ""overall, the benefits of the pfizer-biontech and moderna covid-19 vaccines continue to outweigh the known risks of covid-19 disease and its severe complications in a pandemic,"" it added. the authority has also informed the ministry of health (moh) and the expert committee of its assessment. ""we will also continue to monitor this closely and take the relevant and necessary regulatory actions,"" said hsa. the committee said it has reviewed the available international and local data. ""our assessment is that the benefits of receiving the mrna covid-19 vaccines, i. e. , reduction in covid-19 infections and severe complications even if infected, continue to outweigh the risks of vaccination. ""avoid strenuous activity one week after second dose of vaccineas further studies and investigations are ongoing, the currently available data suggests that there may be a ""very small risk"" of myocarditis and pericarditis after the second dose of an mrna vaccine, particularly in young men, said the expert committeeas a precaution, the committee recommended that those vaccinated, particularly adolescents and younger men, should avoid strenuous physical activity for one week after their second dose. they should also seek medical attention promptly if they develop chest pain, shortness of breath or abnormal heartbeats.

""the emergence of infectious variants can lead to widespread community covid-19 transmission as well as the risk of severe covid-19 disease and complications, including long term chronic complications,"" said the committee. it that the benefits of mrna covid-19 vaccination continue to outweigh the known and potential risks. hsa and moh will also continue to monitor the safety profile of the covid-19 vaccines closely and update members of the public of any significant safety concerns detected with the vaccines. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-12,"China brands COVID-19 lab-leak theory as 'absurd,' Blinken urges transparency.","by david brunnstrom, tom daly and michael martinawashington/beijing (reuters) -u. s.  secretary of state antony blinken stressed the need for cooperation and transparency over the origins of covid-19 in a call with chinese counterpart yang jiechi on friday and raised other contentious topics, including china's treatment of uyghur muslims, hong kong and taiwan. yang, china's top diplomat, expressed to blinken beijing's serious concern that some people in the united states were spreading the ""absurd story"" about the coronavirus escaping from a wuhan laboratory, chinese state media said. yang, head of the central foreign affairs commission of china's ruling communist party, also told blinken that washington should handle taiwan-related issues ""carefully and appropriately,"" state broadcaster cctv reported. the call came ahead of a g7 summit in britain attended by u. s.  president joe biden that is expected to be dominated by washington-led efforts to counter china's growing influence. the world's two largest economies are deeply at odds over issues ranging from trade and technology to human rights and the coronavirus.  washington should work with beijing to put ties ""back on track,"" yang said. yang, who had a fiery exchange with blinken in alaska in march during the biden administration's first high-level meeting with its chinese counterparts, said beijing firmly opposed what he called ""abominable actions"" over the pandemic, which he said were being used to slander china, cctv said. the state department said the diplomats also discussed north korea policy and that blinken expressed u. s.  concerns over the deterioration of democratic norms in hong kong and what washington describes as the genocide of muslim uyghurs in china's xinjiang region. blinken also called on china to stop its pressure campaign against taiwan and to release ""wrongfully detained"" u. s.  and canadian citizens, it said in a statement. 'respect facts and science'the state department said the discussion on north korea an issue on which the united states is keen for more chinese action to press its ally and neighbor to give up its nuclear weapons focused on the need for beijing and washington ""to work together for the denuclearization of the korean peninsula. ""it said the two diplomats also continued discussions on shared global challenges, including iran and myanmar, and the climate crisis. ""addressing the covid-19 pandemic, the secretary stressed the importance of cooperation and transparency regarding the origin of the virus, including the need for who phase 2 expert-led studies in china,"" it said, referring to the world health organization. bonnie glaser, an asia expert at the german marshall fund of the united states think tank, said that although the agenda included potential areas of cooperation, the conversation appeared dominated by contentious issues. she said yang's call for washington to work with beijing to put ties ""back on track"" indicated china was still putting the onus on the united states for the problems in the relationship. ""that's a non-starter, but demonstrates that the chinese are sticking to their tried-and-true diplomatic approaches, even though they are not successful. ""a report on the origins of covid-19 by a u. s.  government national laboratory concluded the hypothesis of a viral leak from a wuhan lab was plausible and deserved further investigation, the wall street journal said on monday. ""we urge the united states to respect facts and science, refrain from politicizing the issue . . .  and focus on international cooperation in the fight against the pandemic,"" yang said. his comments on taiwan followed a visit to the chinese-claimed island last weekend by three u. s.  senators on a u. s.  military aircraft.  they met taiwanese president tsai ing-wen and announced the donation to taiwan of 750,000 doses of covid-19 vaccine, drawing a sharp rebuke from china's defense ministry. in addition to coinciding with biden's first overseas trip as president to attend the g7 summit, the call comes as washington has been pushing policies to address challenges from china. in the past eight days, biden updated an executive order banning u. s.  investment in companies linked to china's military and rolled out steps aimed at china to shore up u. s.  supply chains.  his trade representative katherine tai held a call with taiwan, the pentagon wrapped up a china policy review, and the senate passed a sweeping package of china-focused legislation. eric sayers, a visiting fellow at the conservative american enterprise institute, said all that amounted to good timing for the administration to have an exchange with beijing. ""the white house should feel more confident taking these calls and letting beijing run down their stale talking points,"" sayers said.

""the decision was taken after taking into account daily cases are still over 5,000,"" he said. he did not say which period of time the average daily figure of 6,871 was based on. datuk seri ismail sabri added that regulations such as bans on inter-district travel and social activities and cuts to workplace staff capacity would continue from the existing lockdown that began on june 1 and was set to expire after next monday. ""i hope there is no more confusion on the enforcement of standard operating procedures (sop).  i don't want the public to be affected by misinterpretation of the sops by the authorities,"" he said. the lockdown, which allows only 17 economic sectors to operate, was imposed after a looser movement control order (mco) last month failed to curb malaysia's worst coronavirus wave, with both public and private healthcare resources overrun by a record number of active cases.  instead, may has been the deadliest month so far, logging more than a third of the 3,768 fatalities recorded in total. the health ministry reported 6,849 new cases yesterday, the highest this week, bringing the total to 646,411, with a record 912 currently warded in intensive care units. malaysia's lockdown, dubbed a full mco (fmco), would have ended its first phase next monday had the health ministry's risk assessment based on infection rates and hospital capacities deemed that the curbs were successful in reducing infection numbers. the ministry said on wednesday that the rate of transmission had dipped just below 1. 0 to 0. 96, indicating that the number of new patients daily was decreasing slowly. once malaysia ends the fmco, a second phase lasting four weeks will follow, with more economic sectors that do not involve mass gatherings allowed to reopen. should the situation continue to improve, malaysia will see a further easing to something similar to last month's mco, in which most economic activities subject to sops and health protocols were allowed, while social activities remained banned. however, malaysia's long-term exit strategy from mco restrictions largely revolves around achieving herd immunity before the end of the year. after a slow start, the national covid-19 immunisation programme has steadily increased the rate of doses administered daily, with 157,949 receiving jabs on thursday.  over 2. 8 million people, or nearly 12 per cent of the adult population, have had at least one dose.

""south-east asia has done a wonderful job during the first wave of the pandemic but people later lowered their guard and this gave the virus free rein on the ground.  the governments have tried to ramp up their vaccination campaigns but with the exception of singapore they still have a long way to go,"" dr abhishek rimal, kuala lumpur-based regional emergency health coordinator at the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies (ifrc), told the straits times. singapore is the region's leader in vaccinations, with more than 30 per cent of the population fully vaccinated.  it has allowed children from the age of 12 to be vaccinated and month-long restrictions put in place to combat a spike in cases look set to be eased from monday (june 14). but many of singapore's neighbours are hampered by slow progress in their vaccination campaigns, with most having inoculated less than 10 per cent of their population. several countries are now working to speed up their efforts. indonesia, which has given out more than 30 million shots mostly to the elderly, health workers and those with disabilities is allowing old folk to turn up at any designated facility for a jab without prior registration, while offering shots to the young if they help bring in those aged 60 years and above to be inoculated. indonesia has asked china for technical assistance to help it become a regional production hub for the covid-19 vaccine.

malaysia, which is in the throes of another lockdown after registering record-high cases and deaths in recent weeks, has opened up mega vaccination centres to inoculate up to 8,000 people a day. vaccine trucks have been deployed to areas where people might find it difficult to get to an immunisation centre. close to four per cent of malaysia's 32 million population a total of 1. 22 million are now fully vaccinated. the government has said that 16 million vaccine doses will arrive in the next two months. thailand has set a target to administer 500,000 shots per day from this month, five times more than the previous daily average.  it has announced plans to open up the tourist resort of phuket next month for fully vaccinated tourists. the thai government has also allowed private and local administrative organisations to procure covid-19 vaccines, but only through approved agencies such as the national vaccine institute and the thai red cross society.

cambodia has mobilised the army to inoculate its citizens and the one millionth and two millionth vaccinated person received 10 million riel (s$3,244) each. laos has banned the purchase of covid-19 vaccines by private entities in order to stave off complaints about inequality in the country, while neighbouring vietnam once a model for its successful handling of the pandemic has appealed to the public to donate to a covid-19 vaccine fund as it struggles to contain a new wave of the disease.

the philippines has extended vaccinations to children aged between 12 and 15, while private firms are allowed to procure vaccines for their workers without having to donate part of their shipments to the government. in order to help shore up confidence in the vaccine programme and tackle the issue of vaccine hesitancy, local celebrities were roped in to get their jabs publicly, while some cities and towns went a step further by offering everything from cattle to land to property in a bid to entice people to get their jabs.

despite their best efforts to bump up vaccinations, countries in the region still face various challenges, chief among them getting enough vaccines. it is estimated that the region will need some 1. 4 billion doses to cover the entire population of more than 650 million, leading some analysts to caution that this would be a formidable challenge since the global demand for vaccines outstrips supply. some countries are only receiving their first stocks now.  impoverished timor leste received its first batch of vaccine doses from covax, comprising 24,000 astrazeneca doses, only on april 5 this year.  it received 100,000 doses of sinovac vaccines from china on june 7. covax is the world health organisation-led initiative to secure vaccine supplies for developing countries. ""slow vaccine roll-out will have critical consequences for south-east asia,"" ms hanh nguyen and mr james borton wrote in the international intelligence publication, geopolitical monitor, on may 25. ""for a region that relies heavily on export and tourism, the low vaccine coverage plus closed border policy mean countries will not open their economies soon, thus missing out on economic opportunities as the west gradually reopens. ""another issue has been competition between the west and china as beijing expands its vaccine diplomacy in the region.  apart from sales, china has donated vaccines to cambodia, laos, myanmar and the philippines. ""as of right now, china stands out in its vaccine diplomacy efforts a move that the global superpower will likely use to solidify its position within the south-east asia,"" mr shazwan mustafa kamal, a senior associate with political risk and public consultancy vriens & partners, told st. the united states has recently announced plans to donate seven million doses to south asia and south-east asia, while the g-7 is expected to donate one billion vaccine doses to the world's poorest countries.  but mr shazwan said western powers appeared to be playing catch-up to china. ""south-east asian nations will be in an unenviable position in balancing china's overtures as well as their relationships with the us,"" he added. dr kevin s. y.  tan, a visiting senior fellow at iseas-yusof ishak institute who has written about vaccination efforts in the region, said it is too early to ascertain whether china's vaccine diplomacy will lead to any significant geopolitical shifts. ""if the pandemic drags on and if other vaccine sources are somehow limited, there will naturally be a greater dependency on chinese vaccines.  such vaccine dependency, in the long run, may bolster china's standing among south-east asian nations,"" he told st. logistics is another major issue in a region marked by vastly different terrain, from modern cities to rural mountainous areas and far-flung islands. this comes on top of poor infrastructure and limited resources to distribute and store vaccines, a significant roadblock for rapid deployment, especially for last-mile delivery. experts fear that if this is not overcome, the overall recovery for any nation will be difficult and time-consuming, especially if coronavirus variants lead to new waves of infection. as such, it is important that governments ensure the necessary infrastructure is in place, said iseas' dr tan, especially for vaccines with ultra-cold storage requirements. ""but if such infrastructure is unrealistic at the moment, then a decision to use more 'logistically friendly' vaccines may be a pragmatic and feasible approach,"" said dr tan, who is also an adjunct faculty member at the school of global studies in thailand's thammasat university. another issue that could hamper the region's success in tamping down the virus is the ongoing civil unrest in myanmar.  political instability in the country has exacerbated an already overstretched healthcare system and observers fear it is in danger of turning into the next covid-19 epicentre. locals told st the military government has set up vaccination centres but not many people are turning up for the jabs due to high distrust of the military junta's capability to administer, store and transport the vaccines. many have also refused to get vaccinated as a mark of protest against the junta. ""i am not getting vaccinated as i do not trust the quality and efficacy of the vaccines after the coup.  my friends and family pretty much hold the same view as well,"" investment analyst ye salween, 31, told st. the jury is still out on whether the region can be fully vaccinated by the end of next year, a target set for the world by british prime minister boris johnson. ifrc's dr abhishek described it as an ""ambitious"" target while iseas' dr tan said to do so would require a ""colossal effort"" which can be achieved, but only with support from foreign countries. ""this is because not a single country in the region has come up with its own home-made vaccine against covid-19 so far.  as a region, we are still dependent on supplies and support from sources beyond south-east asia and this is a glaring vulnerability that may need to be addressed,"" said dr tan. professor paul tambyah, president of the asia-pacific society of clinical microbiology and infection, said locally manufactured vaccines were ""the obvious answer"", noting that middle-income countries such as indonesia, thailand and malaysia had well established vaccine-manufacturing capacity. ""the key has to be the trips waiver,"" he told st, referring to the world trade organisation's (wto) agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights that governs the transfer of property like movie rights or vaccine-manufacturing specifics. ""with the trips waiver on patents, south-east asian countries could rapidly scale up vaccine production. ""he added that, without the constraints of the patents, mass vaccination could be rolled out very quickly the way measles and polio vaccines, which were locally made, led to the virtual elimination of these diseases. as of now though, reports say malaysia and the philippines will experience delays in the delivery of the astrazeneca vaccine manufactured in thailand.  that is going to exacerbate the situation in the philippines, in particular, because some vaccination sites in the capital, manila, have been closed due to the shortage of vaccines. mr jose ma luis montesclaros, an associate research fellow at the s.  rajaratnam school of international studies, has suggested that asean should support the private sector to develop vaccine production capacity. ""i feel that expanding the supplies of vaccines is something that benefits not only the vaccine- producing/recipient countries, but the world over, given the interconnected nature of global trade and investments,"" he told st. ""the sooner countries are able to solve the health problem, the sooner they can begin working on economic recovery,"" he added. • allowing the elderly to go to any designated vaccination facility without prior registration. • younger indonesians are eligible for shots if they help bring in those aged 60 years and older to get vaccinated. • aiming to become a regional production hub for covid-19 vaccine. • set up mega vaccination centres that can inoculate up to 8,000 people a day. • deploying vaccine trucks to rural communities. • government has pledged 16 million doses of vaccines in the next two months. • targeting to administer 500,000 shots per day from this month, five times more than the previous daily average. • shopping malls and supermarkets are among the 25 vaccination sites in bangkok. • aiming to open up phuket for vaccinated tourists next month. • approved vaccinations for children between the ages of 12 and 15. • several towns and cities are offering cows, bags of rice, land and properties to entice people to get jabs. • deploying vaccine buses to reach poorer, less accessible districts. • residents sent text messages urging them to contribute to a covid-19 vaccine fund. • looking to buy covid-19 vaccine production technology and build a plant to supply vaccines for the covax programme. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-12,"Euro 2020: Italy off to a winning start, Latest Football News.","italy kicked off the european championship in emphatic style on saturday morning (june 12, singapore time) as they delivered a commanding performance to sweep past toothless turkey 3-0 at the stadio olimpico in rome and stamp their early authority on group a. after a goalless first half, an own goal and strikes by ciro immobile and lorenzo insigne were just reward for the home side, who played with relentless positivity from the start. their dispiriting failure to qualify for the 2018 world cup looked a distant memory as they stretched their unbeaten run to 28 matches in a buoyant atmosphere. they were helped by a flat display from turkey, who lost their fifth consecutive opening match of a european championship and barely mustered a worthwhile attack all night. ""it was important to start well here in rome and it is a joy for us and for all the italians,"" said coach roberto mancini. ""we produced a good performance and i think we satisfied everyone, for the fans and all the italians watching.  (but) there are six games to go and there are a lot of good teams. ""switzerland and wales, who meet in the group's second game in baku on saturday, always knew italy were the group favourites but the size of their task has suddenly looked somewhat bigger. after a build-up featuring a spine-tingling rendition of nessun dorma by opera singer andrea bocelli – channelling thoughts of italia '90 – a spectacular fireworks display and a typically raucous rendition of italy's national anthem, the 16,000-strong crowd was in fine voice by kick-off. they were given plenty to cheer too as italy made all the early running against a turkish team happy to sit deep and invite pressure.  however, mancini's side were left frustrated in their efforts to break through the wall of red shirts. giorgio chiellini had a header tipped over with a spectacular one-handed save by ugurcan cakir and immobile nodded a cross wide as italy went in at the break with 14 attempts to none from turkey – but without a goal. they kept probing and their patience was rewarded when berardi fired a cross into the six-yard box where demiral chested the ball into the net – the first time in a european championship that the tournament's opening goal was an own goal. the ever-dangerous leonardo spinazzola had a shot beaten away and manuel locatelli's low effort was palmed wide before immobile doubled italy's lead by pouncing on cakir's parry from another spinazzola effort to neatly knock in the rebound. the azzurri's dominance was rewarded again when immobile threaded a pass to insigne, who placed a precise finish into the bottom corner with 11 minutes remaining. it marked the first time italy had scored three goals in a match at the euros at their 39th attempt and capped a perfect start. mancini had told his players they should enjoy themselves and seek to entertain and that was exactly what they did for a jubilant home crowd. there was only gloom in the visiting camp as veteran coach senol gunes, who led turkey to third place at the 2002 world cup, apologised for the performance. ""i was expecting a better game, and i am disappointed and we are sorry,"" he said.  ""italy totally controlled the game. ""on june 16, italy face switzerland in rome and turkey take on wales in baku in the second round of group a games.  – reutersget the new paper on your phone with the free tnp app.  download from the

2021-06-12,China's anti-sanctions law: What we know.,"beijing: a new chinese law against foreign sanctions is designed to boost beijing's power against international pressure, but could spark compliance dilemmas for foreign businesses operating in the world's second-largest economy. it comes just a week after us president joe biden expanded a blacklist of chinese companies in which americans are not allowed to invest. here is what we know about the law so far:what is it?the anti-foreign sanctions law was rushed into force on thursday (jun 10).  it aims to protect chinese individuals or organisations in the event that a country ""uses various pretexts or its laws"" to take ""discriminatory"" action against them. no country is specifically named.  but beijing has accused western nations of ""suppressing"" china's development, especially the united states.  it has lashed out at ""illegal and unreasonable"" sanctions over human rights and flagged an urgent need to fight back. what could it do?countermeasures listed in the law include denying visas, deportation, or seizing assets of those who formulate or comply with sanctions against chinese businesses or officials. it rules that authorities are not only able to target individuals and groups but can also take aim at their family members. the law is broad and ""significantly increases the punitive power of china's anti-sanctions measures"", said university of hong kong associate professor angela zhang. ""the broad scope of this framework means that lots of folks, like scholars, pundits, think tanks, could be sanctioned for supporting sanctions on china,"" warned julian ku, an expert on international law at hofstra university. how could it impact business?senior executives of entities on a countermeasure list could also come under pressure, with potential implications for a large number of people and businesses. ""affected businesses could lose entire access to the chinese market, and chinese citizens and institutions will need to cut ties with affected ngos and think tanks,"" zhang told afp. the law could also create severe compliance issues for multinational companies. part of the legislation prohibits those in china from going along with designated foreign sanctions.  it acts in a similar way to a european blocking statute ""which nullified the effect of us iran sanctions within the eu"", said ku. this puts foreign businesses in a bind if they cannot legally comply with both us sanctions and chinese prohibitions. why now?the law builds on earlier measures which prevent companies and individuals from complying with foreign sanctions targeting china. in an explainer on the national people's congress website, an official said the law was passed in a short period of time because there was ""an urgent need to counter the hegemonism and power politics of certain western countries"". the law will help ""counteract the containment and suppression"" china faces, the official added. beijing has long complained about us sanctions and trade restrictions affecting chinese companies.  but in recent months biden has stepped up us criticism over intellectual property theft and alleged human rights abuses in hong kong and the northwestern xinjiang region. how much of a threat is it?ku warned the law had ""some reasonable parts, and some troubling parts"". the section allowing for retaliatory sanctions ""is unprecedented compared to other countries' sanctions regimes"", he said. foreign companies are regularly caught in the crosshairs of tension between china and western nations, including recent nationalist attacks on fashion brand h&m for voicing concern about forced labour claims in xinjiang. zhang said she believes chinese authorities will not immediately wield the new powers, given that anxiety among foreign businesses could lead to more decoupling. ""if, however, foreign governments continue to press on with aggressive sanctions, then i believe china will start deploying those anti-sanctions laws to demonstrate their coercive power,"" she said. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-12,Ride-Hailing Firm Didi Reveals $1.6 Billion Loss Before IPO.,"chinese ride-hailing company didi revealed a $1. 6 billion net loss for 2020 as it moves ahead with plans for a u. s.  initial public offering. the company in its first public filing for the ipo listed the offering as $100 million, a placeholder that will change when the company discloses terms for the share sale.  didi filed thursday under the business name xiaoju kuaizhi inc. , with goldman sachs group inc. , morgan stanley and jpmorgan chase & co.  leading the offering. listen: fion li, bloomberg's team leader for asia deals, discusses didi's ipo plan with juliette saly and doug krizner on bloomberg daybreak asia. didi, one of the largest investments in softbank group corp. 's portfolio, accelerated its listing plans after its business rebounded as the coronavirus pandemic ebbed in china.  the company has been considering seeking a valuation of as much as $70 billion to $100 billion in the ipo, bloomberg news reported in april. in recent months, didi has been trading at a valuation of about $95 billion on the secondary market, said people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the information was private.  the company last raised funding at a $62 billion value last year, according to pitchbook.  a representative for didi declined to comment on the company's valuation. softbank's vision fund, uber technologies inc.  and tencent holdings ltd.  are currently among didi's biggest shareholders with a combined stake of about 41%, its filing shows.  didi co-founder will wei cheng holds 7% of the shares. softbank's 21. 5% stake could be worth $15 billion or more at the targeted valuation range, although that stake could be diluted in the offering.  the japanese company invested more than $10 billion in didi, bloomberg news has reported. while didi has expanded into 15 countries, most of its revenue still comes from its china mobility business. didi reported revenue of $21. 6 billion in 2020.  in the first quarter of this year, as china recovered from the pandemic, revenue more than doubled from the year before to hit $6. 4 billion.  the company also turned a profit for the quarter, reporting net income of $837 million. the murder of two passengers by didi drivers in the summer of 2018 sparked public outrage and the mass deleting of the company's app.  didi's founders cheng and jean qing liu called the deaths the company's darkest moment. ""in the summer of 2018, two tragic safety incidents occurred on our 'hitch' platform,"" they wrote in a letter to investors included in the filing.  ""these shook us to our core.  we felt an immense sense of sadness and responsibility and began a period of deep self-reflection. ""the company cited safety concerns among the risks to its business, saying failure to ensure safety could cause it to lose customers.  the company said in its filing that, after the deaths, it suspended the hitch carpooling service for more than a year to develop procedures to protect riders and drivers. other potential risks for didi line up with those of their ride-hailing competitors around the world.  rivals could undercut didi's customer prices or poach drivers with better earning potential, the company said in the filing, and its business model would suffer if their army of drivers were re-classified as employees. the company also cited the possibility of antitrust fines or regulations, as well as the chance its share price could drop because of negative sentiment in the u. s.  about chinese companies. an ipo would cap a remarkable turnaround for a company that first ran afoul of regulators and then faced the effects of the pandemic.  didi seeks to tap the same investor enthusiasm that propelled this year's tech debuts by chinese video service kuaishou technology and south korean e-commerce pioneer coupang inc. didi's ipo would also mark a monumental year for chinese tech ipos.  kuaishou raised more than $6 billion via a hong kong debut in january, while bytedance ltd.  itself is expected to put in motion a listing later this year. didi was founded in 2012 by former alibaba group holding ltd.  staffer cheng.  it clashed with uber in china for years until the u. s.  firm retreated in 2016, selling its operation in the country to didi. the company is looking for capital to invest in technology, grow its presence in some international markets and introduce new products, according to the filing.  it is planning to make its debut in western europe this year, bloomberg news reported in february, and it's invested heavily in so-called community buying, one of the hottest e-commerce growth areas in china. didi, which remains the dominant player in china, is also looking to leverage that lead to expand into adjacent arenas from autonomous driving to electric vehicles. the company said in thursday's filing that it plans to list its american depositary shares under the symbol didi, although it didn't specify on which exchange. — with assistance by coco

""beyond that, employers will have to start thinking about incorporating these processes as part of their bcps (business continuity planning). ""measures which f&b operators have to take in line with safe distancing rules include ensuring that their restaurants have ""good ventilation"" and groups of diners are seated at least 1m apart. rostered routine testing is already being done in a number of higher-risk settings in singapore, including migrant worker dormitories, construction worksites, shipyards, air and sea ports, hospitals and nursing homes. individuals, whether vaccinated or not, are tested once every seven days or once every 14 days, depending on their risk level. read next: singapore to ease covid-19 curbs and reopen in 2 phases from june 14: everything you need to knowjoin st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

serbia's novak djokovic celebrates after winning his semi final match against spain's rafael nadal in paris june 11, 2021.  ― reuters pic

follow us on instagram and subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates. paris, june 12 ― novak djokovic compared defeating rafael nadal at the french open to scaling mount everest as he described yesterday's epic semi-final triumph over the 13-time champion as ""one of his three greatest victories"". djokovic condemned nadal to only his third loss in 16 years and 108 matches at roland garros to reach his sixth paris final after a showdown which even beat the country's covid-19 curfew. in their 58th career clash, djokovic triumphed 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 and stays on course to capture a 19th major and become the first man in over 50 years to win all four slams twice. djokovic, the 2016 champion in paris who had also beaten nadal at the 2015 tournament, will face stefanos tsitsipas in sunday's final in what will be his 29th championship match at the slams. tsitsipas had earlier become the first greek to reach a grand slam final with a 6-3, 6-3, 4-6, 4-6, 6-3 victory over germany's alexander zverev. nadal, 35, who would have been the oldest finalist at the french open in the modern era, remains tied on 20 majors with roger federer. ""it was a privilege to face rafa in such an incredible match,"" said djokovic after four hours and 11 minutes of intense action. ""tonight it was my greatest ever match in paris. ""it was his second win in nine meetings in paris with nadal, a sequence which also included three losses in finals. ""definitely one of the top three matches that i ever played in my entire career,"" said djokovic. ""considering quality of tennis, playing my biggest rival on the court where he has had so much success and has been the dominant force in the last 15-plus years, and the atmosphere which was completely electric.  just amazing. ""it was nadal's first defeat in 14 semi-finals in the french capital. ""probably it was not my best day today, even if i fought,"" said nadal. ""sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.  i had a big chance.  there were some crazy points but there was fatigue there. ""djokovic finished with 50 winners; nadal committed 55 unforced errors under the relentless assault. ""it's hard to find words bigger than all the superlatives you can think of for rafa's achievements in roland garros,"" added 34-year-old djokovic who now leads their series 30-28. ""each time you step on the court with him, you know that you have to kind of climb mount everest to win against this guy here. ""djokovic had two break points in the opening game of the first set which stretched to 10 minutes but was unable to convert. curfew-buster nadal made him pay, sprinting away for a 5-0 lead before the top seed got on the board. djokovic clung on, retrieving one break to get to 2-5 but nadal eventually prevailed after one hour on court even if he required seven set points to edge ahead. as a sign of the tension of the occasion, nadal complained to chair umpire eva asderaki-moore that he needed more time to collect his towel. djokovic aired his bemusement at the amount of clay on the baselines. the old rivals exchanged breaks in the second and third games of a big-hitting second set but it was djokovic who repeated the feat for a 4-2 lead before levelling the tie. twice in the third set djokovic edged ahead, only to be reeled back in by nadal who broke back in the 10th game as the world number one served for the set. djokovic then had to save a set point with an ice-cool drop shot in the 12th game. ""you cannot play better clay court tennis than this.  it's perfect,"" tweeted andy murray. a 92-minute third set ended with djokovic taking the tiebreak. in a further twist on a dramatic evening, the 5,000 spectators inside court philippe chatrier were allowed to watch the conclusion of the match despite it passing the 11pm covid-19 curfew. ""in agreement with the national authorities, the match will come to an end in your presence,"" said a stadium announcer told delighted fans. nadal then broke in the first game of the fourth set but djokovic levelled for 2-2 and broke again for 4-2. he finished it off on a second match point when nadal hit wide and long.  ― afploading. . . © 2021, malay mail, all rights reserved.

2021-06-12,The politics of Japan’s Taiwan vaccine donation.,"japan quietly shifts its stance on taiwan amid growing concerns over beijing's economic and military might. tokyo, japan – the japanese government has injected itself into the increasingly tense confrontation in the taiwan straits. last friday, japan sent taiwan 1. 24 million doses of astrazeneca's covid-19 jab, after taiwan's president tsai ing-wen accused china of blocking the territory's access to vaccines amid its worst coronavirus outbreak since the pandemic began. beijing regards taiwan – a self-governing island that lies 161km (100 miles) off the chinese coast – as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve its goal.  it has taken an increasingly assertive stance since tsai was first elected in 2016, claiming that she wants independence for the island's 23. 6 million people, and tensions have risen as traditional allies, including the united states, rallied to support taiwan. japan has for decades taken a quieter approach. but with china's growing economic and military might and its continuing challenge to japanese sovereignty over the senkaku islands, known to the chinese as the diaoyutai islands, the government in tokyo is changing tack. ""the japanese conservatives have really seized upon the taiwan issue as a way of drawing lines with the chinese,"" said daniel sneider, lecturer in east asian studies at stanford university. china's rise has worried many in japan. in recent years, beijing has become increasingly assertive in the asia pacific region, showcasing its military might in the east china sea and the south china sea to back its maritime and territorial claims in the disputed seas. taiwan, which also lays claim to the south china sea, has also felt the heat from beijing. over the past year, the chinese military has sent fighter jets into the island's airspace on a near-daily basis, with 25 chinese military aircraft flying through on april 12. in a bid to counter china's growing clout, japan is forging security ties with countries like australia and india, and reinforcing its alliance with the united states, which also sees beijing as a strategic competitor. when us president joe biden and japanese prime minister yoshihide suga met in washington, dc, in april, china was the top focus of their talks.  and for the first time in more than half a century, the leaders' joint statement included a reference to ""the importance of peace and stability across the taiwan strait"". additionally, when japan's defence ministry released a draft of its annual ""white paper"" last month, it mentioned the taiwan issue for the first time ever. ""the stability of the situation surrounding taiwan is important for the security of japan and the stability of the international community,"" the draft document said. beijing condemned the japan-us stance on taiwan as interference in its internal affairs, accusing the two countries of ""ganging up to form cliques and fanning bloc confrontation"".  chinese officials have also previously described concerns over its military and economic clout as part of a ""cold war mentality"" that seeks to contain it. it is in this broad context that japan, which once ruled taiwan as a colony, jumped to the island's aid as it scrambled to secure supplies of the coronavirus vaccine. as sneider put it, ""it's about demonstrating that japan has an interest in the continued de facto independence and security of taiwan.  it's that simple. ""beijing has denounced japan's moves. when the first reports of tokyo considering sending vaccines to taipei emerged in late may, chinese foreign ministry spokesperson wang wenbin responded sharply.  ""we are firmly against those who exploit the pandemic to put on political shows or even meddle in china's internal affairs,"" he said.  ""i've noticed that japan can barely ensure adequate supply of vaccines at home. ""he added, ""i would like to stress that vaccine assistance should be restored to its origin purpose, which is to save lives, and should not be reduced to a tool for selfish political gains. ""wang's contention that politics are involved was not entirely misplaced. several reports in both the japanese and taiwanese media highlighted the role that former japanese prime minister shinzo abe, a longtime ""china hawk,"" had played in expediting the delivery of the vaccines to taiwan. reporting on june 3, the sankei shinbun newspaper said abe, who stepped down last september, had been closely involved in the discussions and noted taiwan's generous donations to japan at the time of the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2011. in taiwan, the japanese donation was a triumph for tsai's government. tsai, who received global praise for her handling of the pandemic early on, is facing public anger after a sudden surge in covid-19 infections that began last month.  to date, the island has recorded 11,968 infections and 333 deaths, of which the vast majority were reported in the past month. with less than 3 percent of the taiwanese public vaccinated, anger is growing over the shortage of covid-19 jabs. taiwan says the crisis has been compounded by china. on may 26, tsai accused china of using its influence to block a large delivery of the pfizer-biontech vaccine. beijing has denied the claim, however, and says taiwan had in fact refused to accept its offer of vaccines.  wang, the spokesman for the chinese foreign ministry, also accused tsai's democratic progressive party (dpp) of prioritising ""political manipulation over anti-epidemic cooperation"". lev nachman, a visiting scholar at the national taiwan university, said the dpp faced a dilemma. ""the reality is that taiwan needs vaccines,"" he said, ""and the catch-22 is that the dpp government really can't politically afford to take vaccines from the prc. ""if the independence-leaning dpp were to turn to the mainland for help, he noted, it could undermine the party's own legitimacy as a self-governing force. but ""by taking vaccines from japan, that's much less politically loaded than taking vaccines from the prc, which is, of course, a major win for taiwan,"" said nachman. moreover, the process of bringing in the vaccines from japan allowed various rival dpp politicians to make a rare show of unity, signalling that they had acted responsibly for the benefit of the people – although taiwanese authorities still have quite some distance to go to secure vaccines for the island's entire population. even the supporters of the beijing-friendly opposition party, the kuomintang, are feeling ""quiet appreciation"" for japan, said nachman. many taiwanese also took to social media to show their gratitude when news of the japanese donation came.  several people posted photos of themselves travelling in japan in the pre-pandemic era as a means to demonstrate their appreciation for and closeness with their northern island neighbours, according to brian chee-shing hioe, editor of new bloom, an online magazine covering youth culture and politics in taiwan and the asia-pacific. hioe also weighed in on the wider strategic context, noting that japan's donation was followed a couple of days later by a us pledge of a further 750,000 doses. ""the us was coordinating this behind the scenes,"" hioe asserted, ""to cement this relation between japan and taiwan, which is useful for regional security, for american purposes.

""we clearly have an imbalance there,"" dr tom shimabukuro, deputy director of the cdc's immunisation safety office, said in a presentation to an advisory committee to the us food and drug administration meeting on thursday. the overwhelming majority of the cases have occurred within a week of vaccination, shimabukuro said. there were 283 observed cases of heart inflammation after the second vaccine dose in those aged 16 to 24 in the vaers data.  that compares with expectations of 10-to-102 cases for that age range based on us population background incidence rates, the cdc said. shimabukuro said there was a predominance of males in younger age groups among the reported heart inflammation cases. the median age of patients who experienced the inflammation after a second vaccine dose was 24, according to the vaers data. just under 80 per cent of the cases were in men. shimabukuro also said the vaccine safety datalink (vsd) another safety monitoring system – showed an increased incidence of heart inflammation in 16 to 39 year olds after their second shot when compared to the rate observed after the first dose. pfizer said it supports the cdc's assessment of the heart inflammation cases, noting that ""the number of reports is small given the number of doses administered. ""about 130 million people in the united states have received both doses of one of the mrna vaccines. ""it is important to understand that a careful assessment of the reports is ongoing and it has not been concluded that the mrna covid-19 vaccines cause myocarditis or pericarditis,"" the company said in a statement. moderna said it also has not established a causal association with the condition and its vaccine.  it said it is actively working with public health and regulatory authorities to further assess the issue. the cdc said it will hold a meeting of its advisory committee on immunisation practices next week to further evaluate the evidence and assess the risk of myocarditis following mrna vaccination for covid-19. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

""where available, use a vehicle maintenance pit or purpose-built vehicle ramp or lift to safely access the bottom of a vehicle,"" the council stated. sunday's incident is the second workplace fatality for smrt in two years.  in march last year, a technical officer died while working at the bishan depot.  mr muhammad afiq senawi, 30, was operating a hydraulic press machine when a 5kg rod flew out, broke through fencing and hit him in the face. these incidents followed other serious worksite mishaps at smrt. in 2016, two trainees aged 24 and 26 were killed on a track near pasir ris mrt station. in 2018, a 59-year-old worker had his right foot amputated after it was crushed by a maintenance train. the 2016 tragedy was found to have been caused by a failure to impose safety protocols while the cause of the other incident has not yet been made known. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright © 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.
