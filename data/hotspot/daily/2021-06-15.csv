""he's been a reliable performer for us for a long period of time,"" southgate said. ""we can't have all the burden of scoring on harry kane's shoulders.  we need the wide players to chip in. ""i'm delighted for him as he went quite a few tournament matches without scoring before today.  he set the tone with his pass to phil (foden) early on today. ""his work without the ball was phenomenal, positionally and his desire to track. ""'block the noise out' the 'football's coming home' anthem belted out by england's fans during the post-match lap of honour carried extra meaning for sterling. linked with a move away from city after scoring once in his last 16 appearances at the end of this season, sterling found comfort in his return to north london, where he grew up just a few miles from wembley. ""it's a great feeling for me playing at wembley, not far from where i grew up as a young boy and seeing the stadium being built,"" sterling said. ""there are a lot of different reasons i haven't scored for my club and that's totally irrelevant now. ""i'm here with england, i'm enjoying my football and that's the most important thing. ""i just tried to focus and come into this tournament with a clear head.  i know what i can bring to the team and it's as simple as that. ""sterling won the man of the match award, but leeds midfielder phillips pushed him close. phillips was a surprise choice by southgate, but the 25-year-old seized his chance with a stylish performance. deployed by leeds in a midfield holding role, southgate urged phillips to have a more forward-thinking mindset and he responded with the dynamic burst that set up sterling's winner. ""kalvin is a fabulous boy to work with, so unassuming.  his contribution to the goal summed his day up,"" southgate said. ""he's technically good and we knew the athleticism in midfield was going to be important. ""all the attributes are there.  high performance, low maintenance.  we like that a lot. ""next up is friday's grudge match against scotland and southgate warned his players not to rest on their laurels. ""you can get a bit of a glow from the win and go a bit soft,"" southgate said. ""we've got to make sure we're ready for what is going to be an incredible game against scotland.

""i spoke to the mp, ms joan pereira, and she said i don't have to go so far, i can just come here.  but i didn't expect to have to wait so long,"" said the former school librarian, who has yet to be vaccinated. bukit merah resident simon lee, 65, had been in the queue since 9. 40am and was given a swab test about an hour later.  ""they said we could just walk in, so since we are free, we just decided to queue,"" the taxi driver said. mr lee, who was in the queue with his mother-in-law, wife and daughter, said he was not bothered by the waiting time.  ""it shows that everyone is disciplined.  when called upon, we would do our part to be tested,"" he said. a resident who wanted to be known only as madam teoh, 71, said she was prepared to wait for two hours to get tested.  ""i rather come here because it's close to where i live,"" said the retiree, who lives at the nearby block 120.  ""even if i don't queue today, i will have to queue tomorrow too,"" said madam teoh, who visited the bukit merah market and hawker centre every day before its temporary closure. undergraduate germaine tan, 21, who made an appointment for a swab test at 10. 30am, joined the queue for those with bookings about five minutes before her scheduled timing.  she still had to wait in line, with about 20 others ahead of her.  ""it's quite organised, because there's someone ushering the queue, so it's not so bad,"" said the third-year undergraduate from the singapore institute of management.  residents and members of the public who had visited either 115 bukit merah view market and food centre or shops at 116 bukit merah view between may 25 and june 12 were urged to go for a free covid-19 swab test. staff and tenants who had been working at 115 bukit merah view market and food centre from may 25 have been quarantined and would be swabbed during quarantine. staff and tenants who had been working in the nearby 116 bukit merah view from may 25 also had to go for their mandatory swabbing to disrupt any wider, undetected community transmission. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright Â© 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-15,47 y/o man allegedly attacked by neighbour with bike chain for placing bicycle by the corridor.,"source: alex tohsw / facebooka singaporean man, who goes by the moniker alex tohsw, encountered ""a horrifying experience"" on sunday (13 june) when his neighbour allegedly attacked him from behind with a bicycle chain attached to a lock pad, while he was cleaning the window panel outside his house. he first posted about the incident on the complaint singapore facebook group, which has now garnered about 1. 9k shares and 1. 4k likes. mr alex wrote that he was cleaning the window panel outside his house while standing on a metal ladder, when his neighbour suddenly attacked him from behind with a bicycle chain, which was attached to a lock pad. ""he claimed that i was blocking his path to go back home just because i placed his bicycle by the walkway,"" he noted. mr alex also alleged that the neighbour hit him twice on the head and shoulder with the bicycle chain. ""i shouted for help as my head was bleeding profusely and i was in severe pain.  my 2 kids were in the living room and were startled to see me covered in blood,"" he added. mr alex noted that his other neighbour intervened and quickly stopped the assailant from attacking him. ""my helpful neighbour lay me down as i was feeling unconscious but i was very worried for the safety of my 2 kids as the main door was unlocked.  thankfully my helpful neighbour was keeping an eye on the assailant,"" he noted. following the incident, the police told mothership that a 65-year-old man has been arrested for ""voluntarily causing hurt with a dangerous weapon"" and it is currently under police investigation. the police said it was alerted about the incident at 10. 26am on saturday at block 130 ang mo kio avenue 3. ""a 47-year-old man had sustained a laceration on his head, and was conscious when conveyed to the hospital,"" it noted. while many netizens expressed their wishes for mr alex's speedy recovery under the comment section of his post, several facebook users seem to question the assailant's side of the story and what triggered him to assault mr alex in the first place. however, many netizens pointed out that the neighbour should not use violence against mr alex nonetheless, as causing injury to others is wrong unless if it was for self-defence.

2021-06-15,UK's Johnson delays COVID-19 lockdown easing for England by 4 weeks.,"london: british prime minister boris johnson confirmed monday (jun 14) that the next planned relaxation of coronavirus restrictions in england will be delayed by four weeks, until jul 19, as a result of the spread of the delta variant. in a press briefing, johnson voiced his confidence that he won't need to delay the plan to lift restrictions on social contact further, as millions more people get fully vaccinated against the virus. he said that by jul 19, two-thirds of the british population will have been double-vaccinated. ""i think it is sensible to wait just a little longer,"" he said.  ""now is the time to ease off the accelerator, because by being cautious now we have the chance in the next four weeks to save many thousands of lives by vaccinating millions more people. ""accompanying the decision to delay the easing, johnson said the government has brought forward the date by which everyone over the age of 18 will be offered a first dose of vaccine, from the end of july to jul 19. ""it's unmistakably clear the vaccines are working and the sheer scale of the vaccine rollout has made our position incomparably better than in previous waves,"" he said. under the government's plan for coming out of lockdown, all restrictions on social contact were set to be lifted next monday.  many businesses, particularly those in hospitality and entertainment, voiced their disappointment ahead of the official announcement. the delta variant first found in india is estimated by scientists advising the government to be between 40 per cent and 80 per cent more transmissible than the previous dominant strain.  it now accounts for more than 90 per cent of infections in the uk. when johnson first outlined the government's four-stage plan for lifting the lockdown in england in february, he set jun 21 as the earliest date by which restrictions on people gathering would be lifted.  however, he stressed at the time that the timetable was not carved in stone and that all the steps would be driven by ""data not dates"" and would seek to be ""irreversible"". the speed at which new coronavirus infections have been rising had piled the pressure on johnson to delay the reopening so more people can get vaccinated. on monday, the british government reported 7,742 new confirmed cases, one of the highest daily numbers since the end of february.  daily infections have increased threefold over the past few weeks but are still way down from the nearly 70,000 daily cases recorded in january. many blame the conservative government for the spike in infections, saying it acted too slowly to impose the strictest quarantine requirements on everyone arriving from india, which has endured a catastrophic resurgence of the virus. across europe, many countries, including france, have tightened restrictions for british travelers to prevent the delta variant from spreading.  others, like spain, are allowing british tourists to arrive without being required to take a test if they have been fully vaccinated. despite concerns about the delta variant, the uk's vaccine rollout has won plaudits as one of the world's speediest and most coherent.  as of monday, around 62 per cent of the british population had received one shot, while about 45 per cent had got two jabs. the rapid rollout of vaccines and a strict months-long lockdown helped drive down the number of virus-related deaths in the uk in recent months.  despite that, the country has recorded nearly 128,000 virus-related deaths, more than any other nation in europe. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-15,Singapore marine life enthusiasts âhorrifiedâ over beach goers digging up sea creatures.,"singapore: a facebook post about the treatment of marine creatures by changi beach visitors recently has got wildlife enthusiasts riled up. the post was shared in the singapore wildlife sightings facebook group by one of its members, ms daphne ting, who witnessed the happenings at changi beach on sunday (jun 13) morning while she was on an intertidal walk. an intertidal walk is one that traverses the coastal area at the edge of land and sea that is submerged at high tide, but dry and exposed to air during low tide. in the post, ms ting noted groups of beach goers, armed with shovels, tongs and pails, were digging up holes, ""searching for these marine creatures and wrecking the entire shore"". among the creatures they collected were crabs, fish, shells, sea cucumbers, eels, jellyfish and sea anemone, ms ting said in her post. ""there were other beach goers who were very angry at this too.  but even after telling these people not to collect the marine life, they just walked away and continued collecting more,"" the 28-year-old wrote. speaking to cna over the phone, ms ting added that she'd shared her post hoping someone would shed light on what can be done, as this was the first time she'd seen people collecting marine creatures ""on a mass scale"". ""when my boyfriend and i saw them collecting the creatures in the pail, we saw the way they handled the tongs.  they'd pick up soft creatures in a very rough manner.  if you were there, you'd also feel horrified at the way they handled the creatures,"" she told cna. why the uproarsuch a sight is, unfortunately, common, according to marine biodiversity enthusiasts who spoke to cna. ""it's not that people aren't aware of these creatures, but they're unaware of how the creatures behave.  they don't know that putting them into buckets with other creatures can cause stress or harm to them.  if you're going to stuff them into a pail, the oxygen level depletes rapidly and might cause them to die,"" said dennis chan, 27. the founder of the untamed paths, an organisation that attempts to raise awareness of unconventional biodiversity in singapore, said that ""putting these creatures in buckets also increases the temperature of water, causing more distress"". some marine creatures that suffer in this way include starfish and anemone. ""starfish will detach their arms when stressed; anemones will die when forcefully uprooted and taken out of the water.  like most marine life, starfish are also stressed by natural elements like the influx of freshwater or rain.  they become pale and die off slowly.  so imagine human impact on these delicate creatures,"" said mr jianlin liu, who has been going on intertidal walks at least thrice a month for nine years. ""prying soft invertebrates like marine flatworms and nudibranchs off rocks can also severely hurt or kill the animal. ""the 31-year-old, who has flown to bali twice a year for the last five years to do intertidal surveys, reasoned that such behaviour usually stems from a ""lack of education"", an ""others do, so i follow"" mentality and being able to see the creatures clearer in the pail. ""but other reasons include to harvest and consume marine life, sell the animals for money to aquariums or to collect for one's personal aquarium,"" he added. aside from harming the creatures, mr liu added that the behaviour mentioned in the facebook post also destroys the habitat. ""no matter how gentle we are on the shores, there will be some impact.  with the huge crowd, a lot of marine life residing, breeding and feeding in the sand or seagrass will be killed due to excessive trampling,"" he said. mr liu added that wearing inappropriate attire, like being barefoot or walking in slippers, during intertidal walks might also harm the individual, as many marine life ""defend themselves with venom that can be fatal to humans"". ""while our shores are beautiful, there are known dangers around.  we have past incidents of singaporeans stepping on the venomous stonefish and the pain is extreme,"" he said. what can be doneeven though collecting marine creatures during intertidal walks is harmful, it seems that regulation around marine biodiversity has many ""grey areas"", said ms ting. ""but just because it might be legal doesn't mean it's ethical,"" she said. as such, whenever mr chan and his team at the untamed paths guide participants during intertidal walks for 10 to 15 days a month, he cannot tell beach goers who pick up marine creatures that their actions are against the law. ""instead what we can do is show people how they can experience an intertidal zone and show respect to the creatures they encounter,"" he said. ""when you go to nature reserves, you aren't going to catch a frog.  that rule should apply here too. ""mr chan's advice to people who wish to go on intertidal walks is to leave their pails and tongs at home. ""just go to these zones and experience it with your phone or camera.  but leave those other items at home so you're not encouraged to pick things up.  there's no need to,"" he said. cna contacted the national parks board (nparks) for a statement. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

wildlife enthusiasts riled up.', 'the post was shared in the singapore wildlife sightings facebook group by one of its members, ms daphne ting, who witnessed the happenings at changi beach on sunday (jun 13) morning while she was on an intertidal walk.', 'an intertidal walk is one that traverses the coastal area at the edge of land and sea that is submerged at high tide, but dry and exposed to air during low tide.', 'in the post, ms ting noted groups of beach goers, armed with shovels, tongs and pails, were digging up holes, ""searching for these marine creatures and wrecking the entire shore"".', 'among the creatures they collected were crabs, fish, shells, sea cucumbers, eels, jellyfish and sea anemone, ms ting said in her post.', '""there were other beach goers who were very angry at this too.', 'but even after telling these people not to collect the marine life, they just walked away and continued collecting more,"" the 28-year-old wrote.', 'speaking to cna over the phone, ms ting added that she\'d shared her post hoping someone would shed light on what can be done, as this was the first time she\'d seen people collecting marine creatures ""on a mass scale"".', '""when my boyfriend and i saw them collecting the creatures in the pail, we saw the way they handled the tongs.', ""they'd pick up soft creatures in a very rough manner."", 'if you were there, you\'d also feel horrified at the way they handled the creatures,"" she told cna.', 'why the uproarsuch a sight is, unfortunately, common, according to marine biodiversity enthusiasts who spoke to cna.', '""it\'s not that people aren\'t aware of these creatures, but they\'re unaware of how the creatures behave.', ""they don't know that putting them into buckets with other creatures can cause stress or harm to them."", 'if you\'re going to stuff them into a pail, the oxygen level depletes rapidly and might cause them to die,"" said dennis chan, 27. the founder of the untamed paths, an organisation that attempts to raise awareness of unconventional biodiversity in singapore, said that ""putting these creatures in buckets also increases the temperature of water, causing more distress"".', 'some marine creatures that suffer in this way include starfish and anemone.', '""starfish will detach their arms when stressed; anemones will die when forcefully uprooted and taken out of the water.', 'like most marine life, starfish are also stressed by natural elements like the influx of freshwater or rain.', 'they become pale and die off slowly.', 'so imagine human impact on these delicate creatures,"" said mr jianlin liu, who has been going on intertidal walks at least thrice a month for nine years.', '""prying soft invertebrates like marine flatworms and nudibranchs off rocks can also severely hurt or kill the animal.', '""the 31-year-old, who has flown to bali twice a year for the last five years to do intertidal surveys, reasoned that such behaviour usually stems from a ""lack of education"", an ""others do, so i follow"" mentality and being able to see the creatures clearer in the pail.', '""but other reasons include to harvest and consume marine life, sell the animals for money to aquariums or to collect for one\'s personal aquarium,"" he added.', 'aside from harming the creatures, mr liu added that the behaviour mentioned in the facebook post also destroys the habitat.', '""no matter how gentle we are on the shores, there will be some impact.', 'with the huge crowd, a lot of marine life residing, breeding and feeding in the sand or seagrass will be killed due to excessive trampling,"" he said.', 'mr liu added that wearing inappropriate attire, like being barefoot or walking in slippers, during intertidal walks might also harm the individual, as many marine life ""defend themselves with venom that can be fatal to humans"".', '""while our shores are beautiful, there are known dangers around.', 'we have past incidents of singaporeans stepping on the venomous stonefish and the pain is extreme,"" he said.', 'what can be doneeven though collecting marine creatures during intertidal walks is harmful, it seems that regulation around marine biodiversity has many ""grey areas"", said ms ting.', '""but just because it might be legal doesn\'t mean it\'s ethical,"" she said.', 'as such, whenever mr chan and his team at the untamed paths guide participants during intertidal walks for 10 to 15 days a month, he cannot tell beach goers who pick up marine creatures that their actions are against the law.', '""instead what we can do is show people how they can experience an intertidal zone and show respect to the creatures they encounter,"" he said.', '""when you go to nature reserves, you aren\'t going to catch a frog.', 'that rule should apply here too.', '""mr chan\'s advice to people who wish to go on intertidal walks is to leave their pails and tongs at home.', '""just go to these zones and experience it with your phone or camera.', ""but leave those other items at home so you're not encouraged to pick things up."", 'there\'s no need to,"" he said.', 'cna contacted the national parks board (nparks) for a statement.',

2021-06-15,Myanmar junta media accuse Karen armed group of killing 25 workers.,"myanmar's junta-controlled media on monday (jun 14) accused an ethnic armed group of killing 25 construction workers in the east of the country after abducting a group of 47 people last month. reuters was unable to reach the karen national defence organisation (kndo) for comment on the accusation.  the junta spokesman did not answer calls to seek further comment. reuters was unable to independently verify details of the incident or the identities of those reported killed. conflicts in myanmar's borderlands have reignited in several places since the army seized power on feb 1 and overthrew elected leader aung san suu kyi. the global new light of myanmar newspaper and army controlled myawaddy television showed pictures of what appeared to be 25 dead bodies laid in a forest clearing. they said the men had been working on the uhu creek bridge in the myawaddy district, near the border with thailand, and were abducted from the construction site on may 31 in a group that also included 10 children and six women. the global new light of myanmar said a total of seven bodies were found on jun 11, one burnt and the others with hands tied behind their backs.  it said the other 18 bodies were found on jun 12. ""officials from the bridge construction site checked the dead bodies with their identities to inform parents and relatives,"" it said. fighting has intensified in eastern myanmar since the coup and clashes have driven thousands of people from their homes. the kndo, which has been fighting for greater autonomy for the karen people since 1947, is among the ethnic armed groups that have strongly opposed the military takeover. the junta's forces have killed more than 860 people since the coup, according to the assistance association for political prisoners activist group.  the junta has said the number is much lower. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

""these hugely important findings confirm that the vaccines offer significant protection against hospitalisation from the delta variant,"" said ms mary ramsay, head of immunisation at phe. the phe findings follow a scottish study which showed that two doses of a covid-19 vaccine among people who tested positive cut their risk of hospitalisation by 70 per cent, although there were not enough hospital admissions reported to compare the vaccines. phe said that while further work was being undertaken to establish the level of protection against mortality from the delta variant, levels of protection against death were expected to be high. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright Â© 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-15,China Nuclear Plant Issue Prompts Board Meeting Call From EDF.,"the taishan nuclear power plant in back in 2013. photographer: peter parks/afp/getty imagesthe french utility that partly owns a nuclear power plant near hong kong is seeking more information on a gas buildup in a reactor, even as its chinese partner insists the facility is operating safely. electricite de france sa, which has a 30% stake in the taishan nuclear plant in south china, has called for an extraordinary board meeting with majority owner china general nuclear power corp. , or cgn, to discuss the increased concentration of inert gases at the unit 1 reactor in guangdong. paris-based edf's call for more information on the issue -- first detected in october -- comes after cgn said sunday that environmental indicators at and around the facility are normal.  it's premature to say whether the reactor will have to be halted, spokespeople for edf said. a spokesperson for shenzhen-based cgn referred to earlier statements on the issue when asked to comment on edf's request.  shares of the firm's hong kong-listed unit fell as much as 3. 5% in tuesday trading as other uranium-related stocks dropped. data from the joint company that operates the facility, tnpjvc, suggest the coating on ""a few fuel rods"" has deteriorated, leading to increased gas within the primary loop of the reactor, edf told reporters monday. the system is designed to collect and treat these gases before they are released outside the plant, and the gas buildup and emissions have remained within chinese regulatory limits, which are in line with average international standards, edf said. china's national nuclear safety administration said in april the plant's unit 1 had experienced an operational incident that was categorized as minor, and not of safety significance. edf, the world's largest operator of nuclear power stations, has faced fuel rod leaks at its french plants in the past.  such leaks don't necessarily require a halt if gas emissions remain within regulatory limits, the spokespersons said.  in france, the deterioration of fuel rods was caused either by a default in the fuel assemblies, or because they were damaged by a stray element in the reactor, they said. the taishan plant, about 130 kilometers (80 miles) west of hong kong, has two units with a combined capacity of 3. 3 gigawatts that came online in 2018 and 2019, making them the most powerful reactors in operation.  they were designed by framatome, a subsidiary of edf, which also supplied their atomic fuel.  each reactor contains 241 fuel assemblies, which consist of 265 rods each, according to the french utility. framatome warned the u. s.  government of an ""imminent radiological threat"" at the plant, cnn reported monday, citing unnamed u. s.  officials and documents the news network says it has reviewed. the unit is ""supporting resolution of a performance issue with the taishan nuclear power plant,"" framatome said in an email, adding that ""according to the data available, the plant is operating within the safety parameters. ""several high-level meetings have taken place in washington, as well as discussions between the u. s.  and french governments and contact between the u. s.  and chinese administrations, as a result of framatome's concerns, cnn reported. u. s.  officials do not believe the situation poses a severe safety threat to the public or workers at the plant, cnn said. the taishan issue is arising amid a power shortage in guangdong, the country's industrial hub, that has caused more than 20 cities to ration electricity to some companies and factories.  unit 1 was operating normally and unit 2 was reconnected to the grid last week after an overhaul, cgn said. issues at the china facility are also a new setback for edf, which is facing construction delays and cost overruns at similar atomic projects in france and the u. k.  it's been showcasing the taishan reactors to convince these two countries to build more such nuclear plants, and other nations such as poland and india to adopt the technology. china is the world's third-biggest nuclear power market, after the u. s.  and france, and has the most new reactors under construction.  it's never had a serious nuclear accident on domestic soil. â with assistance by alfred cang, and krystal

""this will support f&b businesses as we gradually move back to phase three (heightened alert), and encourage them to continue with food delivery sales in the longer run,"" said esg in a statement on sunday (june 13). the food delivery booster package, which subsidises part of f&b businesses' food delivery costs, will be extended to july 15. the package, which started on may 16, was initially meant to run till june 15 to help f&b businesses affected by tightened restrictions under phase two. along with the extension, seven more food delivery platforms and third-party logistics players have been added to the pool which f&b businesses can work with, bringing the total to 13. the new additions are food delivery platform bungkus, and third-party logistics companies chope, grabexpress, pandago, dlvrd, milkrun and yy circle.  the initial pool of six are food delivery platforms deliveroo, foodpanda and grabfood, and third-party logistics companies lalamove, zeek logistics and pickupp. under the extension, esg will continue to provide funding for 5 percentage points of the commission cost charged by food delivery platforms as well as 20 per cent funding of delivery costs for those who use third-party logistics partners. from monday, some covid-19 restrictions will be loosened, with social gatherings of up to five persons allowed.  however, dining in eateries will be allowed only from june 21, assuming the pandemic situation remains under control. noting that dine-in restrictions in the past few weeks have been challenging for the f&b sector, minister of state for trade and industry low yen ling said the extension of the booster package ""seeks to alleviate the painful effects of disruption and offer a longer runway of support even after dine-in services resume on june 21"". since being reintroduced last month, the booster package has benefited more than 10,000 f&b establishments, said ms low. however, she also highlighted that ""food delivery is becoming part and parcel of the new normal"". preliminary estimates by esg show that the daily average number of online food deliveries supported by the booster package was close to 20 per cent higher under phase two (heightened alert) than during the circuit breaker last year. according to esg, the percentage of sales from online food delivery increased from an average of 12. 5 per cent from january to march 2020 to 22. 5 per cent in the same period this year. with the uncertainty of the pandemic, esg said the booster package is also meant to encourage businesses to continue with food delivery sales as part of their long-term strategy so that they can be more resilient amid future business disruptions. asian gastropub slake managed to diversify its revenue streams after using an esg grant to develop an online storefront, which enabled it to tap esg's booster package. after a marketing campaign  boosted  its sales and social media presence, slake is  now looking into converting its siglap kitchen into a cloud kitchen and setting up a second one later this year.  mirroring esg's sentiment, ms low said: ""consumers are increasingly savvy in searching online for the best food and deals to be sent to their doorsteps.  we hope the extended food delivery booster package will place our f&b establishments on a firm footing for a resilient recovery as they gain new skills and platforms critical for long-term growth.

2021-06-15,Five times as many as estimated may have died of Covid-19 in India.,"
revised death tolls suggest that more than a million may have died during india's brutal second coronavirus wave, which is now ebbing
as india's devastating covid-19 second wave continues to subside, data has emerged that suggests undercounting of its virus death toll by up to five times during the spring. officially, india has reported 374,000 fatalities from the virus but successive modelling studies by epidemiologists had already predicted the toll is much higher. approximately 1. 2 million indians had already died by may 15, according dr bhramar mukherjee, a professor of public health and epidemiology at the university of michigan, who has been tracking india's pandemic. now, new analysis of government mortality data from the southern state of andhra pradesh shows over 130,000 deaths in may, nearly five times the number of fatalities for the same month in 2018 and 2019. in the central state of madhya pradesh, april and may saw nearly three times as many deaths as in previous years.   the authorities in both states refused to comment on whether the additional deaths were due to the virus but across india, there have been repeated reports of state governments undercounting covid-19 fatalities. politically, india is governed via a federal system and this has encouraged state governments to underreport covid-19 fatalities in political point-scoring and to reduce panic among citizens.  in many states, covid-19 fatalities were often only reported if the victim had no other co-morbidities, and instead fatalities were marked as being related to a variety of other causes, including heart attacks or diabetes. a succession of investigations by the indian and international media found the number of daily covid-19 burials at individual cremation sites were also exceeding city-wide death tolls.  in india's capital of delhi, families of covid-19 victims reported that they were having to wait for up to 24 hours to cremate their bodies. on wednesday, bihar, one of india's poorest states, revised its total covid-19 death toll from 5,424 to 9,429 following an investigation, after partially decomposed bodies of dozens of alleged virus victims were found floating in the river ganges. the true covid-19 death toll could be higher still in bihar, though, as even pre-pandemic, only one-third of fatalities were registered.  this figure is believed to have dropped further with people wary of visiting hospitals out of fear of contracting the virus themselves.  there has also been a slight increase in deaths from other chronic diseases, such as cancer or kidney disease, as some patients were unable to access life-saving treatment during the height of covid-19 admissions. however, there are increasingly encouraging signs that india's devastating second wave is starting to ebb.  on monday, the number of new daily cases dropped to 70,421, after exceeding 400,000 in mid-may. in the city of ahmedabad, in one of india's worst-hit states of gujarat, doctors reported that the occupancy of covid-19 beds had fallen from 98 percent on march 23 to just two percent on june 12. protect yourself and your family by learning more about global health security we rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism. we urge you to turn off your ad blocker for the telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future. thank you for your support. need help?visit our adblocking instructions

""moreover, the vaccination pace has been stepped up and vaccine supply is expected to resolve in the coming period,"" she said.  effective containment of the covid-19 outbreak topped the list of factors that could see the economists raising their growth outlook for singapore. they also flagged the stronger-than-expected manufacturing sector performance, driven in part by robust global demand for electronics, as a big upside factor. the prospect of reopening borders to international travel could also be a boon to the economy. at the same time, deterioration in the pandemic situation and tighter public health measures as a result was the top downside risk to the growth outlook. the economists polled were also concerned about geopolitical risks, including those stemming from united states-china tensions, and a slower-than-expected labour market recovery, which could weigh on private consumption. ms ling said: ""the main downside risk is if the borders don't reopen, then manpower costs will continue to be the extra whammy for the construction and other labour-intensive sectors. ""this is in addition to the periodic setbacks that new covid-19 variants and resurgence in infections that could disrupt economic activities, she added.  the survey predicts a lower unemployment rate of 2. 7 per cent at year-end, down from the 2. 9 per cent forecast in march. the key manufacturing sector is expected to provide an important boost to singapore's economy, with economists hiking their 2021 growth forecast for the sector to 8. 3 per cent, way above the 4. 7 per cent predicted in march. the forecast for non-oil domestic exports growth was also raised, to 7. 5 per cent from 6. 9 per cent, reflecting upbeat sentiments for global trade. meanwhile, predictions for construction, accommodation and food services sectors which have been weighed down by covid-19 restrictions were lowered slightly for the full year. inflation, measured by the consumer price index for all items, is expected to come in at 1. 4 per cent for the year, higher than the median forecast of 0. 9 per cent in march. the median forecast for core inflation, which excludes volatile accommodation and private transport costs, was raised to 0. 8 per cent from 0. 7 per cent previously. the survey was sent out on may 25.  it reflects the views of 24 respondents and not mas' own forecasts. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright Â© 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-15,Junta trial of Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi to hear first testimony.,"yangon: the trial of ousted myanmar leader aung san suu kyi will hear its first testimony in a junta court on monday (jun 14), more than four months after a military coup. near daily protests have rocked myanmar since the generals' putsch removed her government in february, ending a 10-year experiment with democracy. the mass uprising has been met with a brutal military crackdown that has killed more than 850 people, according to a local monitoring group. the junta has brought an eclectic raft of charges against the nobel laureate, from illegally accepting 11kg of gold to breaking a colonial-era secrecy law. on monday, her defence team will cross-examine witnesses over charges she improperly imported walkie-talkies and flouted coronavirus restrictions during last year's elections that her national league for democracy (nld) won in a landslide. her lawyers who have been allowed to meet with her just twice since she was placed under house arrest have said they expect the trial to wrap up by jul 26. hearings for the case will take place every monday. if convicted of all charges, aung san suu kyi, 75, faces more than a decade in jail. ""we are hoping for the best but prepared for the worst,"" khin maung zaw, one of suu kyi's lawyers, told afp ahead of the hearing in the capital naypyidaw. a separate case is scheduled to start on jun 15, where she is charged with sedition alongside ousted president win myint and another senior member of the nld. cloistered iconaung san suu kyi spent more than 15 years under house arrest during the previous junta's rule before her 2010 release. her international stature diminished following a wave of military violence targeting buddhist-majority myanmar's marginalised muslim rohingya community, but the coup has returned aung san suu kyi to the role of cloistered democracy icon. on thursday, she was hit with additional corruption charges of illegally accepting us$600,000 in cash and around 11kg of gold. her lawyer khin maung zaw dismissed the new charges which could see aung san suu kyi hit with another lengthy prison term as ""absurd"". ""there is an undeniable political background to keep her out of the scene of the country and to smear her prestige,"" he told afp last week. ""that's one of the reasons to charge her to keep her out of the scene. ""myanmar has plunged into a ""human rights catastrophe"" since the coup, the un rights chief michelle bachelet said on friday, adding that the military leadership was ""singularly responsible"" for the crisis. bachelet also slammed the sweeping arrests in the country of activists, journalists and opponents of the regime, citing credible sources saying at least 4,804 people remain in arbitrary detention. junta leader min aung hlaing has justified his power grab by citing alleged electoral fraud in the november poll won by suu kyi's nld. the junta has previously said it would hold fresh elections within two years, but has also threatened to dissolve the nld. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

""the covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the rise of bnpl services in the city-state by forcing merchants and consumers online, allowing shoppers to search quickly for the best deals and easily opt to use the payment method. ""a lot of our users are obviously being impacted by the coronavirus â either they were furloughed or it's just created more uncertainty for someone's income or budget,"" said ed chin, founder of local bnpl startup octifi.

""a credit card is a product that encourages spending but bnpl is not, as once you are overdue, we freeze the account,"" said chen.  the company conducts fraud, credit and risk assessment checks, he added, and observes repayment behavior history and incidence of late or missed payments. the services currently fall outside mas regulations on credit that apply to banks and finance companies, chairman  tharman shanmugaratnam wrote in a recent  reply to questions posed in parliament.  the regulator will consider measures such as verifying bnpl users' incomes and creating a centralized system to check on advances taken between credit cards and bnpl platforms. mas cannot yet share a timeline for the conclusion of its review, a spokesperson said in an email. in the meantime, the central bank is counting on its media blitz to have an impact.  the regulator has worked with an online youth magazine to highlight the risks of overspending via bnpl services.  ""if not careful, one could chalk up debt across multiple installment plans and get into financial distress, especially for someone without a stable income,"" mas warned. still, the services could take off further among southeast asia's growing youth population.  the alternative payments method provides greater access to liquidity for the under-banked in emerging markets, according to octifi's chin.  eager to capture market share, atome, octifi and rely have plans to expand across the region. as they do, they will be targeting consumers like chang wei yue, a 26-year-old public relations executive who recently finished paying off a s$2,000 purchase of invisible braces.

2021-06-15,$150-billion prize in sight for global talks on minimum corporate tax.,"topics

https://mybs. in/2zf9sria global minimum corporate tax would generate around $150 billion in extra revenue for governments across the world, according to the official overseeing frenetic talks to get a deal between 139 countries in coming weeks. 
""this is not an anecdotal amount,"" pascal saint-amans, director of the center for tax policy at the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd), said on bfm business television on monday.  ""in some ways, this is the end of the work on regulating globalisation for greater tax justice. ""

after seven years of technical work on an overhaul of international taxation, negotiators at the oecd will meet in paris june 30 with the aim of making a proposal before a meeting of the group of 20 industrialised nations in july.  that follows an agreement between the group of seven to set a floor on corporate tax rates of ""at least 15 per cent"" instead of the current average of 6 per cent to 7 per cent. 
the $150 billion estimate by saint-aman takes into account the oecd deal on minimum tax, as well as a revised version of existing us measures on taxing foreign profits known as gilti. 
alongside negotiations on a global minimum rate, the oecd is also working on a system to divide up between governments the rights to tax multinationals, particularly tech firms.  the g7 proposed applying new rules to the ""largest and most profitable"" businesses, but that has raised concerns that amazon. com would not be included because of its thin margins. 
saint-amans said those concerns are a ""false debate,"" because the oecd plans to segment its operations to isolate the online retailer's high-margin cloud services operations.  ""the draft agreement foresees that cloud profits would be part of the solution and shared out between states,"" saint amans said. 
he added that political momentum to stop firms parking profits in tax havens, and a need for governments to repair finances after the pandemic, mean that a g-20 deal is possible. 
""it's a month already that we've had little sleep, and the next two weeks will be very important,"" saint-amans said.  ""common sense is difficult for the international community, but i think we can get there. ""

""many students also found home-based learning stressful and missed the social interactions of schooling, support organisations said. mr cho ming xiu, founder and executive director of campus psy, a mental health organisation for youth, said that it has seen a 40 per cent increase in the number of young people seeking emotional support via e-mail, and a 20 to 30 per cent increase across various social media platforms. despite singapore's experience with the circuit breaker last year, the speed at which heightened alert measures came into effect made the situation difficult for many. ""with the sudden limitations of movement, many of our callers found themselves struggling to adjust and adapt to the newly implemented restrictions,"" said sos' mr tan. ""many had to cancel their plans and return to working from home or home-based learning arrangements, which contribute to a state of loss and helplessness. ""the accumulation of these stressors may be overwhelming and with no one to speak to, they reach out to sos. ""however, the experience of last year's circuit breaker helped some organisations prepare for the sudden onset of restrictions, which included a ban on dining in eateries and reduced group sizes for social meetings from five to two. to meet the intensified need for support, cal has increased its number of helplines from one to six since april last year, as well as the frequency of its caregivers-to-caregivers programmes.  these programmes provide fully funded training and support to caregivers of people with mental health issues, such as dementia. silver ribbon singapore, a charity that provides free counselling services, said it saw a 20 per cent increase in calls, but social worker phay yan deng, 29, said the organisation was more prepared to provide support online this time round. he said that during the circuit breaker period, it was ""initially slightly overwhelmed as many things were quite new to us"". ""in the past, we provided emotional support only face to face"", whereas most of its work, from referral to actual sessions, is now done online, he said. however, while organisations may be better prepared, silver ribbon's executive director, ms porsche poh, said it is not helpful to assume that people should be able to cope with heightened alert restrictions just because they have been through it before.

""i have been driving for a long time and have always maintained a clean driving record,"" he said through an interpreter. ""i know i did wrong, and i plead guilty.  please impose a light sentence on account that i'm already advanced in age.

""""in some ways,"" saint-amans said, ""this is the end of the work on regulating globalization for greater tax justice. "" the figure he put forward also includes ""a revised version of existing us measures on taxing foreign profits known as gilti,"" according to bloomberg. the g7 summit represented a major diplomatic and political step forward for the tax measures, as leaders agreed to a minimum rate of at least 15%.  that's what the us had reportedly proposed, a rate lower than the anticipated proposal of 21%, but still in line with the treasury department's proposal. saint-amans also addressed concerns that companies like amazon could dodge the tax due to low profit margins, saying that the oecd would specifically look at its higher-margin cloud services. big tech companies and governments are already lining up behind the measure, lauding the historical step.  but there's still a long road ahead before it's enacted.  the measure will go to the g20 next, and then to the oecd.  countries like the us would also have to craft legislation to officially enact the tax once it's agreed upon, which may prove tricky.  as insider previously reported, the gop's likely opposition to the measure could potentially sink it.  ""why would we want to commit to doubling our global minimum tax? that's a very bad policy,"" sen.  pat toomey, the ranking republican on the senate banking committee, previously told insider.  there's already domestic partisan turmoil over proposed changes to us tax law.  president joe biden wants to raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% to offset infrastructure spending, a proposal that's already drawn republican resistance.  that increase is a red-line for the gop. but, according to the figure cited by saint-amans, leaving behind the global minimum proposal could also leave billions of dollars in potential revenue behind.

2021-06-15,"Israel's new government begins, Netanyahu era ends.","jerusalem: the first israeli government in 12 years not led by benjamin netanyahu got down to business on monday (jun 14), with the former prime minister shying away from a handover ceremony with successor naftali bennett. the right-wing leader's record run in office ended on sunday with parliament approving, by a razor-thin majority of 60-59, a new administration led by bennett, a nationalist whose views mirror netanyahu's on many issues. in tel aviv, thousands turned out to welcome the result, after four inconclusive elections in two years. ""i am here celebrating the end of an era in israel,"" said erez biezuner in rabin square. ""we want them to succeed and to unite us again,"" he added, as flag-waving supporters of the new government sang and danced around him. a combative netanyahu, 71, said that he would be back sooner than expected. ""if we are destined to go into the opposition, we will do so with our heads held high until we can topple it,"" he told parliament before bennett was sworn in. the traditional handover ceremony was not scheduled at the prime minister's office, where netanyahu was expected to meet bennett later on monday to brief him on state matters. the last time netanyahu was unseated as israel's leader, in 1999, he ended his first term in office with a glass of wine in his hand and affable words of welcome to then labor party leader ehud barak, who defeated him at the polls. ""sour, grumpy, not stately â trump-like until the final moment,"" yossi verter, a political affairs commentator, wrote in the left-leaning haaretz newspaper. asked why there would be no such scene now, topaz luk, a senior aide to netanyahu, told army radio: ""that's just what happens. ""netanyahu, he said, was ""filled with motivation to topple this dangerous government as quickly as possible"".  luk declined to disclose netanyahu's comeback strategy, pointing only to the new administration's slim margin of support in parliament. luk said that the incoming government was receiving briefings from netanyahu's diplomatic and security advisers to ensure an orderly handover. after holding its first meeting late on sunday, bennett's new cabinet was invited for a traditional group photograph, showcasing incoming governments, at the official residence of president reuven rivlin. unseating netanyahuwith little in common other than a desire to unseat netanyahu, the patchwork coalition of right-wing, centrist, left-wing and arab parties largely plans to avoid sweeping moves on hot-button issues such as policy towards the palestinians, and to focus instead on domestic reforms. palestinians were unmoved by the change of administration, predicting that bennett, a former defence chief who advocates annexing parts of the occupied west bank, would pursue the same right-wing agenda as netanyahu. under the coalition deal, bennett, a 49-year-old orthodox jew and high-tech millionaire, will be replaced as prime minister in 2023 by centrist yair lapid, 57, a popular former television host. united states president joe biden congratulated bennett and lapid, saying he looked forward to strengthening the ""close and enduring"" relationship between the two countries. addressing parliament on sunday, bennett put biden on notice that he would follow in netanyahu's footsteps in opposing any us return to the 2015 iran nuclear deal abrogated by former president donald trump. netanyahu was israel's longest-serving leader, and had served consecutive terms as prime minister since 2009. he used his global stature to resist calls for palestinian statehood, describing it as a danger to israel's security.  he sought to bypass the palestinian issue by forging diplomatic deals with regional arab states, on the back of shared fears of iran and its nuclear programme. but he was a divisive figure at home and abroad, weakened by repeated failure to clinch a decisive election victory, and by a corruption trial in which he has denied any wrongdoing. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

""a while back, i encountered the corpse of a missing person while diving,"" he said.  ""that is definitely up there with the crazy stories. ""he said the body he found was being sought by investigators as part of an active missing person case. the diver also revealed that he had survived a plane crash in costa rica.   in 2001, mr packard and seven others were in a small plane when it crashed in costa rica, killing three of the passengers.  doctors who treated the survivors â including mr packard, who had sustained injuries to his chest â said they would not have survived another night at their crash site due to the injuries they sustained.  noting the cinematic series of misadventures the diver has had, reddit users asked him who he would want to play him in a movie about his life.  mr packard said he would prefer matt damon, though his wife insists that sean penn take the role. join thought-provoking conversations, follow other independent readers and see their repliesscreengrabwant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later? start your independent premium subscription today. log innew to the independent?want an ad-free experience?subscribe to independent premium.

2021-06-15,Soccer-Sweden make no apologies after Spain stalemate.,"seville, spain:     sweden were out-passed by a factor of over five to one against spain in their opening euro 2020 group e match but they made no apologies for shutting down the spaniards in a dull 0-0 draw on monday. spain dominated possession and played a massive 953 passes, according to uefa statistics, compared with sweden's 178, yet their stifling tactics and superb goalkeeping from robin olsen earned them a point. ""for us, it makes no difference if they have that many passes, if they have the ball outside us and can't find a way in, it makes no difference.  in football, it's about scoring goals, so for me there's no problem,"" sweden defender victor lindelof told reporters. ""i think they (the spaniards) got a bit frustrated.  they had a lot of the ball and some high pressing at times, but we managed to defend well and clear the ball on many occasions.  the longer the match goes, the more frustrated they get because they wanted to score,"" he added. coach janne andersson was delighted with his side after they kept the 2008 and 2012 european champions scoreless. ""it's not like it was raining goal-scoring chances for spain, even if they had a lot of the ball.  robin (olsen) made some good saves, and there were some other good chances for them too,"" he told reporters. andersson sent his side out to be tight and compact, with strikers alexander isak and marcus berg asked to sacrifice the creative part of their game to lead the defensive effort from the front. ""our forwards are the ones who have to run the most and work the hardest, and they are very important when we win the ball based on how we play,"" andersson said. the 58-year-old chose to withdraw isak and berg, both of whom had chances to score what would have been a scarcely-deserved winner for the swedes, in the second half to replace them with fresh legs. ""spain are brutally skilful with the ball, and when you go you have to be sure you can be better in your pressing . . .  sure, there's absolutely things we could do better in this game, but overall i think we did very well,"" andersson said.

2021-06-15,Chinese scientist at centre of COVID-19 controversy denies lab leak theory.,"washington: the chinese scientist at the centre of theories that the coronavirus pandemic originated with a leak from her specialised lab in the city of wuhan has denied her institution was to blame for the health disaster. ""how on earth can i offer up evidence for something where there is no evidence?"" dr shi zhengli told the new york times in rare comments to the media. ""i don't know how the world has come to this, constantly pouring filth on an innocent scientist,"" she told the us daily. us president joe biden last month ordered intelligence agencies to investigate the origin of the pandemic, including the lab leak theory. the leak hypothesis had been floated earlier during the global outbreak, including by biden's predecessor donald trump, but was widely dismissed as a conspiracy theory. but it has gained increasing traction recently, fuelled by reports that three researchers from the wuhan institute of virology became sick in 2019 after visiting a bat cave in the southwestern chinese province of yunnan. shi is an expert in bat coronaviruses, and some scientists have said she could have been leading so-called ""gain-of-function"" experiments in which scientists increase the strength of a virus to better study its effects on hosts. according to the new york times, in 2017 shi and her colleagues at the wuhan laboratory published a report on an experiment ""in which they created new hybrid bat coronaviruses by mixing and matching parts of several existing ones, including at least one that was nearly transmissible to humans, in order to study their ability to infect and replicate in human cells"". but in an email to the paper, shi said her experiments differed from gain-of-function experiments since they did not seek to make a virus more dangerous. instead they were trying to understand how the virus might jump across species.

                gojek will also introduce a payout of sg$3 to drivers who have to drive 3km or more to pick-up their passenger, among other measures.  â kelvin chng/st photosingapore: ride-hailing operator gojek will halve the commission it receives from its drivers from june 21 till at least the end-2022, in order to help them increase their earnings. this means gojek drivers will get to keep 90% of the fare from every trip, instead of 80%. the move comes after grab, the dominant ride-hailing operator here, said it would seek to improve drivers' earnings by introducing a sg$1 fare hike from this month. gojek said on monday (june 14) that the cut in commission, which it refers to as service fees, will help to lessen the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on its drivers.  it said a survey it conducted found that 50% of drivers want lower service fees for better earnings. gojek will also introduce a payout of sg$3 (rm9. 30) to drivers who have to drive 3km or more to pick-up their passenger, among other measures. its general manager, lien choong luen, said: ""the ongoing impact of the pandemic is a consistent worry for our driver-partners as they try to sustain their earnings amidst the uncertainty. """"these measures will have a profound impact on the livelihoods of our driver-partners, increasing their take-home earnings while giving them more flexibility by reducing their dependence on incentives,"" he added. gojek said the changes reflect a significant investment in singapore, as it seeks to grow its market share here. it also said that a recent campaign to provide free or discounted rides to and from vaccination sites for all riders in singapore has registered 117,500 rides so far. several drivers have been calling for ride-hailing operators to cut their commissions to help drivers tide over the impact of the pandemic. while grab has not announced a cut of its 20% commission rate, it said last month that it will permanently raise fares by sg$1 (rm3. 10) from this month to improve driver earnings amid rising fuel and maintenance costs. it will not collect commission on the additional sg$1 from june 1 to june 30.  this means drivers will get sg$1 more for every ride they complete with grab for a month.  â the straits times (singapore)/asia news networkrelated stories:indonesian bts 'army' initiate fundraising for gojek drivers, goes viral with generous tipsbts fans in indonesia raised rm44,000 for food delivery ridersgojek to begin car-hailing services in vietnam

2021-06-15,Teachers contacting parents and students who have not responded to COVID-19 vaccination invite: MOE.,"singapore: teachers are reaching out to parents and students who have not responded to invitations to take the covid-19 vaccination to offer assistance if needed, said second minister for education maliki osman on monday (jun 14). ""it could be an issue where the parents do not know how to (sign up).  it could be an issue that they are not quite familiar with the online system,"" he said, speaking to reporters at a vaccination centre at ite college west. ""it could also be parents have some concerns about safety.  so for that, we are asking our teachers to reach out to them. ""giving updates on thestudent vaccination exercise, dr maliki said that 345,000 text messages and invites have been sent out to eligible parents and students. as of sunday, 300,000 students have registered and booked their slots for their vaccination.  of these students, 101,000 have received their first dose, he added. among students from the graduating cohorts, who were the first batch of students to receive invites, 90 per cent have registered for the vaccination and 75 per cent of them have received their first doses, said dr maliki. some parents may face challenges taking their children to the vaccination centres, such as those who are working and have younger children to care for, said dr maliki. ""for those groups, we assure them that all they need to do is when school reopens, they can get in touch with the schools, get in touch with the teachers, and the schools are ready to help facilitate bringing some of the students together perhaps to a vaccination centre, or creating better transportation facilities for them to do so,"" he added. ""we are still reaching out to all those who have not signed up, who have not registered, and we look forward to them understanding the support that's available for the students to be getting their vaccinations. ""monday was also the first day of vaccinations for ite students.  about nine in 10 of them have registered for the vaccination exercise, said dr maliki. at ite college west, about 280 students took their first dose of the covid-19 vaccine on monday morning. there are 28,000 ite students across singapore, and they can register for the vaccination directly through their schools for the centre set up in their respective colleges, said dr maliki. all three ite college vaccination centres are open, and the fourth moe vaccination centre at raffles city convention centre will start operations on tuesday. the education ministry hopes all students can receive their second dose by the end of august, ""but that all depends"" on the response rate, said dr maliki. ""it's very encouraging today.  by and large, we have about 80 to 90 per cent of responses for the different categories, and we hope more will step forward,"" he added. responding to a question about whether vaccinated and non-vaccinated students will be subject to different measures when they return to school, dr maliki said: ""the last thing we want is for students to be identified as 'you have been vaccinated' and 'you have not been vaccinated', because we do not want a situation where one becomes stigmatised for not being vaccinated. ""certainly, we have to respect decisions by parents, whether they would like their children to be vaccinated or not.  we hope that the environment is one where everyone in the school feels safer, now that the majority would have had their vaccination by the time they resume school at the end of june. ""dr maliki added that schools will continue to adhere to safe management measures like practising hygiene and cleanliness standards, safe distancing and the wearing of masks. ""we will continue to take guidance from the mtf (multi-ministry task force) with regard to the measures that we put in place at the national level and schools will respond accordingly,"" he said. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

""the hotel has worked with vendors to launch activities targeted at families, he added.  these include dim sum cooking classes and virtual reality game experiences. sneakpeek singapore, which organises walking, hiking and kayaking tours, said it is preparing for larger groups, such as readying more kayaks. it added: ""operationally, it will be much easier, less taxing, and less logistically complex to operate tours with sub-groups of five people instead of two. ""during phase two (heightened alert), there was little confidence to make bookings, even for after june 13, but now people are. . .  booking tours for dates that are further away. ""other organisations such as wildlife reserves singapore and dream cruises have said they will increase their maximum capacity in line with what is allowed. the loosened restrictions will also benefit the likes of kitten sanctuary singapore, a non-profit animal welfare group for cats.  executive director jessica seet said the group will now be able to accept more visitors and allow more volunteers to help out. ""visitors are our lifeline to cover (the various) costs for rescued cats and kittens. . .  so the easing of restrictions helps us to stay afloat,"" said ms seet. the islamic religious council of singapore said on saturday that four mosques will pilot the use of an extra zone in order to offer more spaces for friday prayers on june 25. in a facebook post yesterday evening, prime minister lee hsien loong thanked the public for observing the tightened measures this past month. ""if all goes well, we should be able to open up further by next week,"" he said.  ""in the new normal, such disruptions will happen from time to time, but we can still carry on with our lives.

2021-06-15,"Delivery subsidies package for F&B firms gets extended , Singapore News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. as shifting consumer preferences continue to boost the demand for food deliveries, enterprise singapore (esg) is extending its subsidies package for food and beverage (f&b) businesses using such services by an additional month. ""this will support f&b businesses as we gradually move back to phase three (heightened alert), and encourage them to continue with food delivery sales in the longer run,"" said esg in a statement yesterday. the food delivery booster package, which subsidises part of f&b businesses' food delivery costs, will be extended to july 15. the package, which started on may 16, was initially meant to run till tomorrow by helping f&b businesses affected by tightened restrictions under phase two. along with the extension, seven more food delivery platforms and third-party logistics players have been added to the pool of service providers which f&b businesses can work with, bringing the total to 13.  the new additions are food delivery platform bungkus, and third-party logistics companies chope, grabexpress, pandago, dlvrd, milkrun and yy circle. the initial pool of six are food delivery platforms deliveroo, foodpanda and grabfood, and third-party logistics companies lalamove, zeek logistics and pickupp. under the extension, esg will continue to provide funding for 5 percentage points of the commission cost charged by food delivery platforms, as well as 20 per cent of delivery costs for those who use third-party logistics partners. from today, some covid-19 restrictions will also be loosened, with social gatherings of up to five persons allowed.  however, dining in at eateries will be allowed only from next monday, provided that the pandemic situation remains under control. noting that dine-in restrictions in the past few weeks have been challenging for the f&b sector, minister of state for trade and industry low yen ling said the extension of the booster package ""seeks to alleviate the painful effects of disruption and offer a longer runway of support, even after dine-in services resume on june 21"". since being re-introduced last month, the booster package has benefited more than 10,000 f&b establishments, said ms low. however, she also highlighted that ""food delivery is becoming part and parcel of the new normal"". preliminary estimates by esg show that the daily average number of online food deliveries supported by the booster package was close to 20 per cent higher under phase two (heightened alert) than during the circuit breaker last year. according to esg, the percentage of sales from online food delivery increased from an average of 12. 5 per cent from january to march last year, to 22. 5 per cent in the same period this year. with the uncertainty of the pandemic, esg said the booster package is also meant to encourage businesses to continue with food delivery sales as part of their long-term strategy, so that they can be more resilient amid future business disruptions. asian gastropub slake managed to diversify its revenue streams after using an esg grant to develop an online storefront, which enabled it to tap esg's booster package. after a marketing campaign boosted its sales and social media presence, slake is now looking into converting its siglap kitchen into a cloud kitchen and setting up a second one later this year. ms low said: ""consumers are increasingly savvy in searching online for the best food and deals to be sent to their doorsteps. ""we hope the extended food delivery booster package will place our f&b establishments on a firm footing for a resilient recovery as they gain new skills and platforms critical for long-term growth.

2021-06-15,"Indiaâs second COVID-19 wave sparks selfless acts, but the battle is far from over.","with hospitals pushed to the limit, good samaritans have stepped forward to save lives.  but beating the second wave â and preventing a third â will take a lot more, experts tell the programme insight. mumbai: people feared they would die if they stepped out of their homes.  in the streets, people were weeping beside the dead.  oxygen and hospital beds were in dire shortage. as new cases in india exceeded 400,000 and deaths exceeded 4,000 on some days last month, even the rich and connected were not spared from the devastating second wave of the covid-19 pandemic. but the virus did not kill the spirit of generosity. in mumbai, kidney dialysis patient rozy saldhana and her husband had basic medical facilities including an oxygen cylinder set up at home for emergencies.  despite her kidney failure, the 52-year-old did not hesitate to give the cylinder to someone else who needed it. her husband, pascol, had received a call from his friend, a school principal.  the husband of a teacher needed oxygen but could not get hold of a cylinder. watch: in india, dialysis patient saves dying covid-19 victims (3:22)when saldhana â who has been on dialysis for five years â heard about it, she told her husband to give their cylinder to the man.  ""don't worry about me.  i'm fit enough,"" her husband recollected her saying. she did not stop there.  she told her husband to sell all her jewellery and buy oxygen to help more people.  he received 80,000 rupees (s$1,450) from the sale and did as his wife had asked. over in delhi, a sikh voluntary organisation called khalsa help international has set up makeshift hospital facilities in several locations to treat patients.  its free oxygen support service has saved thousands of lives since late april. its founder, gurpreet singh rummy, said the group has not refused anyone.  it has served more than 15,000 people, of whom around 8,000 to 10,000 had arrived in a critical state and would have died without oxygen support, he said. ""whether you're coming in a rickshaw or a mercedes-benz, we treat all equally.  our only priority is the level of oxygen,"" he told theprogramme insight. we don't discriminate on the basis of religion, caste, creed or if one is rich or poor.  our service is for everyone. while getting supplies is not easy, he told reuters that the organisation's volunteers ""travel hundreds of kilometres"" to fetch oxygen, and ""you can't expect such zeal from most government bodies"". it looks like the email address you entered is not valid. the path to catastrophehealthcare experts said a highly transmissible strain, complacency and large gatherings were among the reasons behind the second wave. last year, india was quick to impose a lockdown from late march.  while it caused suffering to migrant workers within the country, it helped contain case numbers, noted rajesh parikh, the director of medical research at jaslok hospital, one of mumbai's top hospitals. but india failed to take advantage of the respite to ramp up facilities and oxygen production, he said. from october, most safety protocols had been abandoned, and millions of people travelled between states.  large gatherings in the form of diwali celebrations and weddings made a comeback. ""one of the confounding factors in the second wave has been large gatherings, whether it's for the kumbha mela, a religious gathering, or the political rallies which occurred throughout west bengal,"" said parikh.  these ""undoubtedly"" amplified the second wave. the authorities also incorrectly estimated that india's population had ""possibly acquired herd immunity"", cited k srinath reddy, the president of the public health foundation of india. antibody surveys were done in a ""patchy"" and ""piecemeal"" fashion across the country, with ""markedly varying results"", noted the professor.  the best results showed widespread detection of antibodies, hence the belief that ""most of india"" had herd immunity. ""the public wanted to believe it.  the businessmen wanted to believe it because they wanted to put the economy back on the rails.  the small traders wanted to believe it because they'd suffered a lot,"" said the cardiologist and epidemiologist. ""the politicians wanted to believe it because they wanted to go back to election rallies . . .  even people who wanted to organise religious festivals wanted to believe that good news, because that's their business as well. ""watch: the full episode â india's covid catastrophe: what went wrong? (48:05)meanwhile, a new viral strain â called the delta variant, or b. 1. 617 previously â emerged and spread more quickly than doctors expected. ""we've seen that (if) even one person in the family is infected, the entire household comes down with the infection in the next 10 or 12 days,"" said mumbai-based infectious diseases expert trupti gilada-baheti. vaccination a matter of urgencythe outcome is immeasurable grief across india.  pune resident arun gaikwad, a 47-year-old indian air force officer, lost his wife and half her family in the span of 15 days in march and april. they had held prayers for his late father-in-law, and one of his brothers-in-law had a cold.  in the following days, nearly everyone who had gathered, including gaikwad's teenage daughter and son, tested positive for covid-19. when his wife developed breathing difficulties, he rushed to several hospitals before locating one 40 kilometres away with a ventilator bed available.  two days after she was admitted, she died of cardiac arrest.  two brothers-in-law and his mother-in-law also died. new cases have declined since last month after lockdowns were imposed.  but to prevent a resurgence, doctors say the country must urgently vaccinate its people. in a population of over 1. 3 billion people, over 240 million doses of vaccine have been administered so far. india must ensure that there are enough vaccines and ramp up its vaccination drive in both cities and villages, said gilada-baheti, who works at the unison medicare and research centre. ""to keep ourselves from a very disastrous third wave, we'll have to vaccinate a substantial number of a population at phenomenal speed,"" said the doctor, who is also a consultant at prince aly khan hospital and at masina hospital. effective control measures would also ease the mental strain on healthcare professionals.

2021-06-15,"COVID-19: Singapore reports 13 new cases, 10 from community.","singapore â the ministry of health (moh) on sunday (13 june) confirmed 13 new cases of covid-19 infection in singapore, taking the country's total case count to 62,276. of the new cases, 10 are community transmissions with eight linked to past cases, said moh in a news release.  five of the community cases have already been placed on quarantine, while three were detected through surveillance.  the remaining two community cases are unlinked.  there are no new cases from the migrant worker dormitories. moh also reported three imported cases, all of whom have been placed on stay-home notice since their arrival in singapore. of the 13 new cases, seven are asymptomatic, and were detected from screening and surveillance, while six were symptomatic. overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased from 116 cases in the week before to 36 cases in the past week.  the number of unlinked cases in the community has also fallen from 17 cases in the week before to 15 cases in the past week. the two unlinked cases are a 23-year-old fully vaccinated male india national who works as a nursing aide at all saints home (hougang) and a 27-year-old male india national who works as an engineer at ecoxplore.  the latter case is the source of a new cluster named after his case number. there are four cases linked to the new cluster.  they are:a 50-year-old bangladeshi man who is employed by theng liang lee services as a conservancy worker at 115 bukit merah view market & food centre. a 72-year-old singaporean man who is fully vaccinated and works at a sundry shop at the location. a 67-year-old singaporean woman who is fully vaccinated and a food stall vendor at the location. a 65-year-old singaporean man who is fully vaccinated and a food stall vendor at the location. the food centre is closed to all members of the public for three days from sunday to 15 june, as moh's epidemiological investigations have found that there is likely ongoing transmission among individuals who work at the location. all staff and tenants who have been working at the location from 25 may have been placed on quarantine, and will be tested during quarantine.  in order to disrupt any wider, undetected community transmission, moh will conduct special testing operations for all staff and tenants who have been working in 116 bukit merah view from 25 may.  moh will also extend free covid-19 testing to members of the public who had visited the shops at 115 and 116 bukit merah view between 25 may and 12 june. there are two new cases linked to the cluster, named after the case number of the 27-year-old male india national who works at ecoxplore. they are a 19-year-old singaporean woman who works as a warehouse assistant at dhl express (singapore) and a 39-year-old singaporean woman who is employed by cleen first services as a cleaner at emerald park condominium.  both are household contacts and family members to each another.  they are household contacts of the male india national. two cases are linked and not part of a cluster.  one of them is a 59-year-old singaporean woman who works as a part-time cleaner at crystal lodge and is a close contact of a previous case.  the other is a 66-year-old singaporean man who is a retiree, and a family member of a previous case.  of the three imported cases, two are singapore permanent residents who returned from india, and one is a work permit holder who arrived from indonesia and is a foreign domestic worker. with 31 more patients discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities on sunday, 61,869 cases â or 99. 3 per cent of the total â have fully recovered from the infection. most of the 130 hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while one of them is in critical condition in the intensive care unit. a total of 243 patients â with mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive â are isolated and cared for at community facilities. apart from the 34 patients who have died from covid-19 complications, 15 others who tested positive for the virus were determined

2021-06-15,Americans who helped Ghosn escape Japan plead guilty.,"a us army special forces veteran and his son pleaded guilty in tokyo on monday to charges that they illegally helped former nissan motor co ltd chairman carlos ghosn flee japan. a united states army special forces veteran and his son have pleaded guilty in tokyo to charges that they illegally helped former nissan motor co ltd chairman carlos ghosn flee japan hidden in a box on board a private jet in december 2019. chief judge hideo nirei, one of the three judges presiding over their first court appearance, on monday asked michael taylor and his son peter whether there was any mistake in the charges submitted by the tokyo prosecutors' office. ""no your honour,"" the older taylor replied.  ""no,"" said his son. extradited to japan from the us in march, they are being held at the same jail in tokyo where ghosn was imprisoned.  they could face up to three years in prison. wearing black jackets and pants, white shirts and plastic slippers, the duo were led into the court with ropes threaded through handcuffs and tied around their waists. prosecutors accused them of helping ghosn evade punishment and escape to lebanon from western japan's kansai airport, receiving $1. 3m for their services, some of which was paid to an advertising company owned by the younger taylor.  the americans asked ghosn for another $500,000 for legal fees after japan sought their arrest, prosecutors said. they also described the younger taylor as a frequent visitor to lebanon and said planning for the escape began about six months before ghosn fled. their statement also said ghosn's wife carole sought help from michael taylor, with ghosn later contacting him from tokyo with a phone he had hidden from the japanese authorities. a third man, george-antoine zayek, recruited by the taylors, travelled to japan later in 2019 to find a way through airport security, settling on the private jet terminal at kansai airport as the best route out, the prosecutors said. zayek remains at large. the luggage that does not fit through the security scanning machine there is inspected by hand.  that check, however, can be waived by the pilot. the taylors' lawyers in the us waged a months-long battle to prevent their extradition to japan, arguing they could not be prosecuted for helping someone ""bail jump"" and that they could face relentless interrogations and torture. suspects in japan are interrogated in the absence of their lawyers and are often denied bail before trial. japan's conviction rate is 99 percent. at the time of ghosn's escape, he was awaiting trial on charges that he understated his compensation in nissan's financial statements by 9. 3 billion yen ($85m) over a decade and enriched himself at his employer's expense through payments to car dealerships. ghosn â who denies any wrongdoing â remains a fugitive in his childhood home, lebanon, which has no extradition treaty with japan. greg kelly, a former nissan executive charged with helping ghosn hide his earnings, is also standing trial in tokyo.  he denies the charges against him. the taylors will make their next appearance in court, the same room where kelly's trial is being held, on june 29, when their lawyers will deliver a statement and the americans will be cross-examined. father-son duo hoped biden administration would block extradition, but us authorities handed them over. former top lawyer says he was surveilled and demoted after he questioned the probe, bloomberg reports. a dutch court rejected the fugitive former auto chief's wrongful dismissal claim against nissan-mitsubishi. on monday morning, a delegation of french investigators began questioning carlos ghosn, the former chairman of renault. we use cookies to give you the best possible experience.  learn more about how we use cookies.  by clicking 'accept' you agree to these cookies.  to decline, click here.

""the capital is in a state that needs extra attention.  if the current situation gets out of hand, we would enter an emergency phase, and if that happened, we would have to take drastic steps like we did in september and february.  we do not want that to recur,"" mr anies said in a statement on monday morning. the delta variant, first detected in india, has started to dominate cases in indonesian cities, with health minister budi gunadi sadikin confirming that covid-19 cases in jakarta, kudus (central java province), and bangkalan (east java province) are dominated by the delta variant, based on genome sequencing tests. bed occupancy rate for isolation wards in jakarta reserved to treat covid-19 patients also increased to 75 per cent on sunday, from 45 per cent a week ago. one out of four covid-19 patients in jakarta, however comes from outside the city, mostly the surrounding satellite towns. mr anies urged residents to strictly comply with health protocols in order to avoid another round of strict social distancing restrictions. currently, dining in eateries is allowed with limited capacity, and non-essential staff are partially required to work from home. the governor also stressed that the positivity rate in jakarta increased to 17 per cent on sunday, from 9 per cent the previous week. the positivity rate indicates the percentage of positive covid-19 cases detected out of the total tests conducted. the threshold set by the world health organisation (who) for adequate testing is a 5 per cent positivity rate. mr anies pointed out that the testing rate in jakarta rose to eight times what the world health organisation recommended, from four times in the previous week. he ordered all his personnel on sunday night to take stricter measures and to step up enforcement of the health protocols on individuals as well as in places. to ensure that residents comply with the strict health protocols, president joko widodo on monday decided to beef up the deployment of military and police officers across 7,000 sub-regencies in the country. indonesia's 34 provinces are made up of more than 500 regencies and cities, which in turn consist of 7,000 sub-regencies.   mr widodo also decided to speed up daily vaccination rate from the current 500,000 doses a day to 700,000 later this month and then one million next month. people living in covid-19 red zones â places with hospital bed occupancy ratio exceeding 60 per cent â will get priority in vaccination, said mr budi, following a meeting with the president.   in addition, places of worship in the covid-19 red zones will be closed for the next two weeks. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright Â© 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

G7 leaders discuss Wuhan lab leak theory behind COVID-19 pandemic.","
britain's foreign secretary dominic raab on the sidelines of g7 summit in carbis bay, cornwall, britain, june 11, 2021
  | photo credit: 
reuters
  world leaders gathered at the g7 summit in cornwall discussed the possibility that a laboratory leak in central china's wuhan city may have a connection with the start of the covid-19 pandemic, with the world health organisation (who) chief saying all hypotheses behind the origins of the deadly disease remain in play. uk foreign secretary dominic raab said that officials ""compared notes"" over the theory that the pandemic may have originated from a leak from a lab in wuhan, calling for further investigations.  however, he asserted that the uk's ""best information"" remained that it ""jumped"" from animals to humans but admitted they did not have ""all the answers"". ""that's why internationally we wanted the review to be able to go into china to get all the answers, so that we have the full picture rather than these possible, potential, plausible options,"" mr raab told 'sky news' on sunday when asked about the issue. ""but, on balance, we do not believe that it came from a laboratory.  we think it is much more likely to have jumped from animal species,"" he said. who director-general dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus told reporters on saturday that the theory was raised during a formal session at the g7 summit in cornwall dedicated to health matters and that identifying the source of the pandemic was a core part of showing respect to the millions of people around the globe who have died from the deadly virus. ""yes, it was raised, and we discussed about the origins,"" he said in response to a question.  ""the first phase of the origin study was not conclusive so there are four hypotheses, but [it's] not conclusive yet.  so we believe that all four hypotheses should be open, and we need to proceed with the second phase, to really know the origins,"" said dr ghebreyesus.  ""as you know, more than 174 million people have been confirmed for covid illness.  this is actually an underestimate, it could be more.  and so far, close to 3. 75 million people have died.  this is very tragic and i think the respect these people deserve is knowing what the origin of this virus is so that we can prevent it from happening again,"" he said, stressing on the importance of ""cooperation from the chinese side"". the origins of the covid-19 remain a widely debated topic, with some scientists and politicians maintaining that the possibility of a lab leak of the deadly virus exists. china's wuhan institute of virology (wiv) is near the outbreak's known epicentre of huanan seafood market in wuhan, where the virus first emerged in late 2019 and became a pandemic.  more than 175 million confirmed cases have since been confirmed worldwide and at least 3. 79 million deaths reported.  china has been accused of withholding raw data and access to sites that would aid deeper investigation into how the virus came into being, and how it first spread.  scientists believe that the virus is likely to have passed from animals to humans, but there remains a possibility that it may have escaped from the wuhan institute of virology, which investigates other coronaviruses.  us president joe biden last month directed the country's intelligence agencies to report in the next three months on whether covid-19 emerged from an animal or during a laboratory accident.  however, beijing has maintained there is no connection between the pandemic origins and the wuhan lab and sought to dismiss the issue of a possible leak as an ""absurd story"". china asserts that the covid-19 broke out in different places in the world and china only reported the virus first.

""our first batch, our graduating students, about 90 per cent of them have already registered, and about 75 per cent received their first doses. ""it's very encouraging to see how the students are responding to all these invitations and smses that have been given to them. ""the hope is that all students will be able to get fully vaccinated by the end of august, dr maliki added, although this will depend on the response rate. schools are contacting parents of students who did not respond to the vaccination bulletins to find out more about their concerns, he said. ""it could be an issue where the parents may not know how to (register). . .  that they are not quite familiar with the online system. ""it could also be that parents have some concerns about issues of safety and so for that, we are asking teachers to reach out to them,"" he said. some working parents may also face challenges in getting their children, especially the younger ones, to the vaccination centres. ""so for those groups, we can assure them that all they need to do is when school reopens, get in touch with the teachers. ""the schools are ready to help, for example, with transport arrangements, he said. the new school term starts on june 28. it was earlier announced that singapore would roll out its vaccination exercise to more than 400,000 students in schools and institutes of higher learning, including autonomous universities, polytechnics and ite, amid more covid-19 infections among children. those affected included students in primary and secondary schools, junior colleges, the millennia institute, madrasahs, special education schools, and the international arms of hwa chong institution, anglo-chinese school and st joseph's institution. students had been invited to sign up for vaccination slots from june 1, starting with about 56,000 students who will be sitting major examinations like the o and a levels this year. those aged 18 and above can opt for either the pfizer-biontech or moderna vaccine, while those aged between 12 and 17 will be offered only the pfizer jab as the moderna vaccine has not been approved for use on this younger age group.

dr maliki said the ite centres will be able to administer 1,600 doses of the vaccine a day, while the raffles city centre can do 2,000 doses a day. this week, the three centres will provide vaccinations for ite students in the morning from 8. 30am to 11. 30am, and for all other students from 1. 30pm to 4. 30pm. he added that there are currently around 28,000 ite students. from next week, the centres will be open to all students.

dr maliki also reiterated that vaccinating students is one of the many protective measures in place to ensure their safety, with the majority of students expected to receive the first dose of their vaccine by end-june when school reopens.  however, safe management measures such as mask wearing, safe distancing and staggered recess times will continue to prevail.  business student danial norizam, 16, was among the ite students vaccinated on monday morning.  he told the straits times that he was a little anxious about the side effects initially, but felt that it was important to get his vaccine in order to keep himself safe.  both his parents, who have already been vaccinated, had also encouraged him to do so.  join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright Â© 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-15,Operator says China nuclear plant facing 'performance issue'.,"hong kong (ap) â the french joint operator of a chinese nuclear plant near hong kong said monday that the plant is dealing with a ""performance issue"" but is currently operating within safety limits, following a report of a potential radioactive leak. the taishan nuclear power plant is jointly owned by china guangdong nuclear power group and french multinational electric utility Ã©lectricitÃ© de france, the main owner of framotome, which helps operate the plant. ""framatome is supporting resolution of a performance issue with the taishan nuclear power plant in guangdong province, china,"" framatome said in a short statement monday. ""according to the data available, the plant is operating within the safety parameters,"" it said.  ""our team is working with relevant experts to assess the situation and propose solutions to address any potential issue. ""radiation levels in hong kong, 135 kilometers (85 miles) from the taishan plant, were normal on monday, according to the hong kong observatory, which monitors radiation around the city. cnn reported monday that framotome had written to the u. s.  department of energy warning of an ""imminent radiological threat"" and accusing chinese authorities of raising acceptable limits for radiation outside the plant to avoid having to shut it down.  cnn said u. s.  officials believed the current situation at the plant did not present a severe safety threat. Ã©lectricitÃ© de france said in a statement monday that it had been informed of the increase in concentration of ""certain rare gases"" in the primary circuit of reactor no.  1 at the taishan plant. ""the presence of certain rare gases in the primary circuit is a known phenomenon, studied and foreseen by the operating procedures of the reactors,"" it said. the utility said it is providing its expertise and has requested that the joint venture company that runs the plant hold a meeting of its board of directors so that management ""presents all the data and the necessary decisions. ""chinese authorities in beijing and guangdong did not immediately respond to attempts to seek comment on monday, a public holiday. the plant issued a statement on sunday saying ""at present, continuous monitoring of environmental data shows that the environmental indicators of taishan nuclear power plant and its surroundings are normal.

2021-06-15,What the G7âs global tax reform plan could mean for Singapore.,"singapore: the recentlandmark accord among the group of seven (g7) nationsfor new tax rules aimed at large multinational corporations (mncs) could see a reduction in  the tax advantage that singapore offers to these businesses, said experts. but it remains too early to tell how this will impact companies' investment decisions and singapore's attractiveness as a regional and global business hub, they added. what the deal is aboutfinance ministers from the g7 advanced economies agreed on jun 5 to back the creation of a global minimum corporate tax rate of at least 15 per cent. they also agreed on allowing countries where an mnc's customers are based to be ""awarded taxing rights of 20 per cent profit exceeding a 10 per cent margin"", regardless of whether the mnc has physical presence in these markets. this hopes to end what united states' treasury secretary janet yellen called a ""race to the bottom"" where countries have competed to lure corporate giants with ultra-low corporate tax rates and exemptions. current global tax rules, which date back to the 1920s, have also been struggling with the rise of technology giants that sell services remotely and attribute much of their profits to intellectual property held in low-tax jurisdictions. the g7 accord comes as no surprise, tax experts told cna, given that negotiations have been coordinated by the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd) for years on rules for taxing cross-border digital services and curbing tax base erosion. but this is not yet a done deal. it remains to be seen if the proposals can garner support from the world's top developed and developing countries at the group of twenty (g20) meeting in venice next month, as well as more than 130 countries under the oecd inclusive framework. g20 member china is among countries that have voiced objections to a global minimum corporate tax rate, reuters reported on jun 10 citing people familiar with the negotiations. given the complexities of multilateral negotiations, it may take ""several years"" before the new rules are implemented, said pwc singapore's tax leader chris woo. ""the entire process will likely take some time, from discussions on the technical design features, achieving political consensus, to putting in place domestic legislation and multilateral instruments to give legal effect to these rules,"" he added. singapore's finance minister lawrence wong has said it remains ""too early to say"" how the g7's deal could impact singapore, but as and when a global consensus is reached, the authorities ""will make any necessary changes"" to the country's corporate tax system. ""we will continue to ensure that our tax system is compatible with international norms, while managing the administrative and compliance burden on businesses,"" he said in a facebook post earlier this month. mr wong also stressed that singapore's competitiveness ""has never been based on taxation alone"". ""trust, reliability and integrity are ultimately what makes singapore an attractive place for substantial economic activities,"" he wrote. ""neutralise"" any tax advantagecurrently, singapore's headline corporate tax rate is at 17 per cent but the effective tax rate of many businesses may be lower than that, or even the proposed global minimum of 15 per cent, due to tax incentives awarded to those seen as beneficial to the country's economic development. with the proposal of a global minimum rate, ""the consequence of a low effective tax rate for mncs in a particular jurisdiction is the triggering of a 'top-up tax' in the jurisdiction of its ultimate parent entity,"" said mr dean rolfe, kpmg's partner and head of international tax for asia-pacific. ""in view that many international businesses see singapore as an efficient gateway into asia, multinationals will be weighing the impact of the global minimum tax against the efficiency and convenience of operating from singapore to manage their regional business,"" he added. mr chester wee, ey asean international corporate tax advisory leader, said: ""basically, the global minimum tax proposal will neutralise any tax advantage that an mnc may secure from singapore.

aboutfinance ministers from the g7 advanced economies agreed on jun 5 to back the creation of a global minimum corporate tax rate of at least 15 per cent.', 'they also agreed on allowing countries

intellectual property held in low-tax jurisdictions.', 'the g7 accord comes as no surprise, tax experts told cna, given that negotiations have been coordinated by the organization for economic

2021-06-15,UPDATE 1-Singaporean automotive marketplace Carro says raises $360 mln to become unicorn.,"(adds detail on investors, tag for pictures) singapore, june 15 (reuters) singapore-headquartered carro, a southeast asian online automotive marketplace, said on tuesday it has raised $360 million in its latest funding round led by softbank vision fund 2, becoming the region's latest unicorn.  ""the valuation for the company is well over a billion dollars,"" ceo and founder of carro, aaron tan, told reuters.  he did not provide a specific number.  carro will use the fresh capital to expand into new locations and grow its business in its existing markets indonesia, thailand, malaysia, and singapore.  it also plans to expand its portfolio of financial services and accelerate development of artificial intelligence capabilities.  carro's platform allows consumers and wholesale businesses to buy and sell vehicles along with providing insurance and financing services.  other investors in the new round of financing include several prominent indonesian based funds including ev growth, it said.  since being founded in 2015, carro has raised more than $400 million in equity and $200 million in debt.  its previous investors include softbank ventures asia, edbi pte, insignia ventures partners and b capital group.  the company has started preparing internally for an initial public offering (ipo), tan said.

2021-06-15,"157 suspected serious reactions to Covid-19 vaccine reported out of nearly 3.7 million doses given in Singapore: HSA, Singapore News.","singapore there have been 157 reports here of suspected reactions to the covid-19 vaccine severe enough to be life-threatening or result in hospitalisation, among other serious conditions. however, no deaths have been linked to the jab, the health sciences authority (hsa) said on friday (june 11). these ""suspected serious adverse events"" made up 0. 004 per cent of the almost 3. 7 million doses of pfizer-biontech and moderna jabs administered till may 23. these serious cases form part of the 4,704 ""suspected adverse events reports"" that hsa received till may 23. this translates into 0. 13 per cent of administered doses, which is consistent with the percentage that had been reported by the authority on may 6, when it last gave an update on the safety record of both mrna vaccines on may 6. these reactions are suspected to be associated with the vaccinations, but may not have been caused by them. an adverse event  or reaction related to vaccination is any undesirable medical condition that occurs after taking the vaccine, which does not necessarily have a direct link to the treatment.  they may be coincidental or related to an undiagnosed disease, but have to be reported by healthcare providers to hsa. reactions are considered serious if they result in hospitalisation, disability or life-threatening illnesses, among other things. [[nid:522094]]anaphylaxis, which is the rapid onset of severe allergic reactions, was the most frequently reported serious adverse event, with 26 such cases.  all of them recovered after medical treatment, hsa said. it added that the incidence rate of anaphylaxis reported here with the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines is about 0. 85 cases for every 100,000 doses of the jabs administered.  ""this is similar to the incidence rates reported overseas of around 0. 5 to two per 100,000 doses administered,"" said hsa. other severe allergic reactions numbered 23.  these include breathing difficulty, fast heart rate, an increase or decrease in blood pressure, chest discomfort and pain, fainting, limb numbness and weakness or pain, changes in vision, increase in liver enzymes, joint pain, fits, ringing in the ears and infections. the authority said most of those who had developed serious adverse events have recovered or are recovering.  ""these serious adverse events are being closely monitored by hsa,"" it added. hsa said that the most commonly reported reactions are consistent with those typically observed following vaccination. from the 4,704 reactions, the most common one was cases of rash, which accounted for more than one in four reported adverse events.  this was followed by cases of swelling of eyelids, face or lips, which occurred in about one in seven cases. these are typically resolved within a few days and are in line with the events described in the covid-19 vaccines product information, as well as those reported overseas. most of adverse events were associated with the pfizer-biontech vaccine, which was rolled out for use here on dec 30 last year and comprised 83 per cent of the doses administered.  moderna was deployed on march 12 this year. about 68 per cent of the total number of reactions reported was among people below the age of 60. hsa pointed out that trials of the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines found that those younger than 60 tend to experience more adverse effects occurring soon after vaccination, compared with those older. generally, younger people have more active immune responses and may experience more adverse effects to the vaccines, said hsa.  it pointed out that this is part of the body's natural response to build immunity against covid-19 infection. the authority added that 64 per cent of these reactions were reported in females. its update also noted that a greater frequency of heart attacks and strokes has not been observed in vaccinated persons locally. this comes after it was announced on friday that six people have been reported to have suffered heart inflammation after receiving covid-19 vaccines four of whom were men aged below 30. as a precaution, experts have advised that vaccinated people, especially adolescents and younger men, should avoid strenuous physical activity for one week after their second dose. ""it is important to note that heart attacks and strokes can occur naturally within our population, regardless of whether people are vaccinated or not,"" said hsa. ""due to the large numbers of people being vaccinated, it is expected that, by coincidence, some individuals may experience other medical events such as heart attacks and strokes in the days or weeks after vaccination which may not be related to the vaccination.

2021-06-15,Man jailed for paid sex act with teenage boy who was looking for a 'sugar mummy'.,"singapore: a man was jailed for 10 months on monday (jun 14) for paying for a sex act with a 17-year-old boy, after tricking the boy into believing he was a ""sugar mummy"". muhammad al-masfuiin mushin, 26, pleaded guilty to one charge of commercial sex with a minor. the court heard that the victim began using an application called locanto in 2017.  he discovered that there were advertisements for sexual services, and users looking for ""sugar mummies"" or ""friends with benefits"". ""sugar mummy"" is a term for older women who pay younger individuals for companionship that may be of a sexual nature. the victim wanted to earn money by offering sexual services and created an account. on jun 16, 2019, the victim was kicked out of his house after a heated argument with his mother.  as he needed money, he put up an ad seeking a sugar mummy, titling it ""toyboy fantasy satisfies you 18"". he included his phone number and two photos of himself in the ad, offering sexual services in exchange for money. the accused saw the ad a day later.  even though the victim was searching for a sugar mummy, muhammad al-masfuiin decided to pose as a woman and chat with the victim. he began chatting with the boy on telegram, saying: ""i'm looking for a young boy to be my sex slave. ""he asked the victim for photos and body statistics of himself, and told him he was female. when muhammad al-masfuiin asked the victim for his real age, the victim replied that he was 17, had been chased out of his house and needed money. posing as a woman, muhammad al-masfuiin asked the victim ""would you have sex with my (boyfriend) and i"", despite knowing there would be no woman involved. the victim agreed and asked for s$250 per meet-up.  muhammad al-masfuiin told the victim that he could stay over, but he would have to perform sex acts on the fictitious ""boyfriend"". at 1am on jun 18, 2019, muhammad al-masfuiin booked a taxi for the victim to go to muhammad al-masfuiin's house.  believing that the buyer was a woman, the victim asked if ""she"" would be joining the sex session. muhammad al-masfuiin replied that she ""might not"", but the boyfriend ""will tell me if you did a great job at sex"".  the victim asked muhammad al-masfuiin if he knew the victim was 17, and muhammad al-masfuiin replied ""yes"", adding: ""i like my boys young"". the victim got to muhammad al-masfuiin's home.  he took a shower on muhammad al-masfuiin's instruction and came out of the bathroom to see muhammad al-masfuiin performing a sex act. muhammad al-masfuiin then performed a sex act on the victim before asking him for sex.  the victim resisted, but muhammad al-masfuiin was of a bigger build than him. before muhammad al-masfuiin could initiate sex, he ejaculated.  the victim got dressed and went to sleep and texted the accused's number, thinking it belonged to a woman, telling ""her"" that the sex session was completed. the next morning, the victim woke up and asked muhammad al-masfuiin for money to get to work.  muhammad al-masfuiin gave him s$50 and the victim left. later that day, a police officer on foot patrol in toa payoh came across the victim.  in the course of investigations, he found messages in the victim's phone pertaining to the provision of sexual services. court documents did not specify why the victim was stopped by police. muhammad al-masfuiin was identified and arrested for commercial sex with a minor under 18. he could have been jailed up to seven years, fined, or both. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-15,"'Strong and stable government' needed in COVID-19 fight, says Sarawak coalition in audience with king.","kuala lumpur: gabungan parti sarawak (gps), the ruling coalition in the borneo state, highlighted the importance of a ""strong and stable government"" as one of the crucial factors in the fight against covid-19 in its meeting with the malaysian king on monday (jun 14). four top leaders from the coalition were the last group to be granted an audience by king al-âsultan abdullah ri'ayatuddin al-mustafa billah shahin a series of meetingswith party chiefs since last wednesday. in a statement issued after the audience via video conferencing from kuching, chiefs of the parti rakyat sarawak (prs), sarawak united people's party (supp) and progressive democratic party (pdp) said they backed chief minister abang abdul rahman zohari abang openg's position as the coalition chairman on three factors for the covid-19 battle. ""the vaccination programme is to be accelerated and completed by august to achieve herd immunity. ""the presence of a strong and stable government to ensure covid-19 programme and (economic) implementation are well-grounded,"" the statement read. the third factor is the implementation of a post-covid-19 economic exit plan, the statement added. mr abang abdul rahman zohari is the president of parti pesaka bumiputera bersatu (pbb).  the gps was formed in 2018 after the four parties quit barisan nasional following the latter's defeat in the 14th general election. while not a member of the perikatan nasional coalition, which took over federal administration in a power tussle last year, gps had said that it supported prime minister muhyiddin yassin in the interest of political stability. the sarawak state election, which was supposed to be held this year, has been postponed as mandated by the state of emergency proclaimed by the king in january. the palace said king al-âsultan abdullah would meet fellow malay rulers on wednesday to discuss malaysia's efforts to curb the spread of covid-19 and its implementation during the state of emergency. in last week's royal audiences, leader of the opposition anwar ibrahim pleaded with the kingnot to extend the state of emergency, which was slated to end on aug 1. calling for the same, united malays national organisation president ahmad zahid hamidi said the party also wantedthe parliament to reconvene.  parliament meetings have been suspended since the state of emergency was declared, putting attempts to challenge mr muhyiddin's razor-thin majority on hold. former prime minister mahathir mohamad, meanwhile, said he is in favour of setting up anational operations councilto help solve the health, economic, and social issues currently plaguing the country. on monday, malaysia's new daily cases dropped below the 5,000-mark for the first time in close to a month.  a nationwide lockdown was earlierextended by another two weeksto jun 28. mr muhyiddin said on sunday that a national recovery plan in preparation for the country to emerge from the covid-19 pandemic was in the works. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

""when we heard the new rules, we thought: finally, we can all go out together.  the kids are enjoying it the most because they get to meet one another,"" said ms siti. she added the five of them were planning to have lunch together at home after their walk. ms tessie parro, 38, her son and daughter, and their domestic helper were also at bishan park.  she said the last time they had all gone out together was before may 16. ""during phase two (heightened alert), i had to go out with only one of my kids,"" she said.  ""i feel happy and relieved that it's safe to go out again.  it's the school holidays so my kids have nothing to do and the house can get very chaotic.  when they're outside, they can release their energy by running around.

""these measures will have a profound impact on the livelihoods of our driver-partners, increasing their take-home earnings while giving them more flexibility by reducing their dependence on incentives. ""gojek said the changes reflect a significant investment in singapore as it seeks to grow its market share here. it also said that a recent campaign to provide free or discounted rides to and from vaccination sites for all riders in singapore has registered 117,500 rides so far. several drivers have been calling for ride-hailing operators to cut their commissions to help drivers tide over the impact of the pandemic. while grab has not announced a cut of its 20 per cent commission rate, it said last month that it will permanently raise fares by $1 from this month to improve driver earnings amid rising fuel and maintenance costs. it will not collect commission on the additional $1 from june 1 to june 30.  this means drivers will get $1 more for every ride they complete with grab for a month. associate professor walter theseira of the singapore university of social sciences said that gojek's move to lower driver commissions has not been seen for years in the local market. prof theseira, who teaches economics and looks at urban transport issues, noted that what matters most for drivers is their take-home earnings, which is also affected by the number of passengers a platform can attract.  ""gojek would very likely have to combine commission cuts to drivers with measures to encourage commuters to switch,"" he added. ""otherwise, you would have more drivers chasing the same number of commuters, which means  their take-home earnings could go down after switching to gojek. ""ms yeo wan ling, adviser to the national private hire vehicles association, said the association welcomes gojek's decision to cut its commission rates.

2021-06-15,"askST: Can we pass Covid-19 to our pets?, Health News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore there have been reports from numerous countries of animals, including pets, getting infected with covid-19. last week, an asiatic lion at a zoo in india died from it.  its death prompted the testing of dozens of elephants at a forest reserve in the country.  tigers in india have also been tested. russia reportedly started vaccinating pets at veterinary clinics with its carnivak-cov vaccine in late may. the straits times (st) answers some common questions about animals and covid-19. a: a small number of animals, including pet dogs, mink raccoon dogs and zoo animals such as tigers and lions have tested positive for covid-19 after coming into contact with infected individuals. two cases of human-to-cat covid-19 transmission in the united kingdom were reported in the journal veterinary research in late april, providing further evidence of such spread. ""one had mild illness and the other severe.  the viral strains in both cats were very similar to human strains,"" said professor paul tambyah from the nus yong loo lin school of medicine. covid-19 infections in farmed mink have also been reported in at least 10 countries.  millions of the animals, which are valued for their fur, have been culled to prevent future spillover events to humans. a: there are very few reports of an animal passing covid-19 back to humans, though there were reports of mink farmers in northern europe infected by strains that moved from humans to mink and back to humans, said prof tambyah. the vast majority of the millions of sars-cov-2 infections have been human-to-human transmissions and it appears that animal-to-human transmission is extremely rare, he added. the world organisation for animal health (oie) said that animals do not play a significant role in the covid-19 pandemic, which is being sustained through human-to-human transmission. a: confirmed cases in cats and dogs are extremely rare and generally result in mild symptoms, said the world small animal veterinary association (wsava) in the united states.  no dog or cat is known to have died from the infection to date, it said. people with suspected or confirmed covid-19 infection should avoid contact with animals, including pets, livestock and wildlife, said the us centres for disease control and prevention (cdc). if you suspect your pet has covid-19, you can contact the national parks board's animal and veterinary services.  it conducts biosurveillance and is able to do the right kind of polymerase chain reaction testing for sars-cov-2 in animals, said prof tambyah. a: no.  prof tambyah said there are no licensed covid-19 vaccines for animals here. the wsava said there have been no cases in which a dog or a cat has been proven to transmit the virus to people.  there is no need for owners to consider vaccinating their pets against sars-cov-2 at this time, it said. ""as sars-cov-2 infection of dogs and cats most commonly originates from an infected human, the best way to protect a pet is to vaccinate the owners so that they are less likely to infect their pet,"" it said in a late april statement. in the us last year, veterinary pharmaceutical firm zoetis started development activities for a vaccine, based on initial concerns about sars-cov-2 in domestic animals. ""if regulatory authorities determine there is a need, we are prepared to act quickly to further develop our covid-19 vaccine for animals,"" ms christina lood, its senior director of innovation and sustainability communications, told st. a: the exact origins of sars-cov-2 are yet to be determined.  it could be many years before we know for sure. the common belief so far is that sars-cov-2 likely originated from bats, a known reservoir of coronaviruses, and jumped to humans through an unknown intermediary animal host, like a pangolin. still, a june 7 report by researchers from china west normal university and oxford university found that more than 47,000 live animals were sold at wuhan wet markets from may 2017 to november 2019, but no pangolins or bats were traded. there are other hypotheses, including the politically charged theory that sars-cov-2 was leaked from a laboratory in china. the oie estimates that at least 75 per cent of emerging infectious diseases affecting humans, including ebola, hiv and influenza, have an animal origin. a: the four wildlife parks here already have strict protocols, such as quarantining new animals, to prevent cross transmission of diseases from humans to animals under their care and vice versa, said a wildlife reserves singapore (wrs) spokesman. the covid-19 outbreak led to more measures, including the need for staff to wash their hands with soap and water before interacting with an animal, as well as donning face masks and gloves when working with an animal. they also minimise or avoid direct contact unless required, especially with higher-risk species such as primates and carnivores. ""as added preventive measures, our great apes such as the orangutans and chimpanzees also undergo temperature checks twice a day,"" said the wrs spokesman. he said the risk of humans contracting covid-19 from animals is very low. ""in addition, our veterinarians assess that due to the low number of community cases in singapore, coupled with the extra precaution we have taken to care for our animals, the risk of our animals contracting covid-19 is very low,"" he said. none of the zoo animals here has been infected with covid-19. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright Â© 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-15,"People's Association withdraws offer to meet couple over wedding photo incident, Singapore News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore the people's association (pa) has withdrawn its offer to meet a malay/muslim couple whose photo was used as a standee for hari raya aidilfitri decorations without permission, citing disagreements with them over the purpose of the meeting and how they had characterised the incident. communications specialist sarah bagharib, 30, had posted on social media on may 28 about the inappropriate use of her wedding photograph at a housing board estate in radin mas constituency. this drew a public apology from the pa and an offer from the government agency to meet her and her husband, mr razif abdullah, to apologise in person for the distress caused by its mistakes. however, in a facebook post on monday (june 14), the pa, which oversees various grassroots groups, said it saw no point in going ahead with the meeting, citing ms sarah's recent comments on the matter. the pa said ms sarah had shared claims that the incident ""perpetuate(s) the racist culture"" and was ""racist"". the agency rejected these claims, saying: ""while the error was culturally insensitive, it was certainly not racist.  it is not right to raise the allegation of racism, without basis, to stoke emotions and sentiments. ""it also noted that she had made a public call for messages and suggestions ahead of the meeting. ""we find this odd.  we do not see why our meeting should be appropriated as a platform for her to funnel the views and comments of persons unrelated to the incident,"" the pa added. ""all these lead us to believe her purpose in agreeing to meet us has gone far beyond the radin mas incident.  we therefore see no point in proceeding with the meeting. ""the couple's wedding photo had been used by a vendor to create a standee alongside a decorative platform and banner depicting radin mas mp melvin yong and his hari raya aidilfitri greetings to residents. the pa had explained in an earlier statement that its radin mas constituency office had engaged a vendor, warabi enterprise (art studio), to design and put up hari raya aidilfitri decorations at the tiong bahru orchid estate. the vendor came up with the concept and design, and downloaded and used the photo from an online source for the standee. after ms sarah drew attention to the matter, the pa removed the standee, and offered to meet the couple. on monday, the pa said it had wanted to clarify its position, elaborate on the steps it had taken to prevent such incidents from recurring, and hear her suggestions of how it might improve at the meeting. it also said it had, over e-mail, explained to ms sarah that it values racial and religious harmony in singapore. the pa also made references to two instagram stories ms sarah had posted recently in explaining its response. 
in the first instagram story, ms sarah reshared an instagram story by another instagram user, @jeanpsychologist and in the second, ms sarah penned a series of reflections on the incident.  photos: sarahbagharib/instagram
in the first, she reshared an instagram story by another instagram user, @jeanpsychologist, who had responded to an instagram post ms sarah had made. user @jeanpsychologist thanked ms sarah for posting on the incident, and called for chinese singaporeans to ""educate ourselves on our conditioned racism"", saying this is ""long overdue towards our friends in minority communities who have to put up with our ignorance which continues to perpetuate the racist culture that hurts them"". in the second instagram story, ms sarah penned a series of reflections on the incident, and said she was thankful to those who had stood in solidarity with her and her husband as well as other ethnic minorities in the aftermath of ""this incident (and other racist attacks and incidents that have been filmed)"". the pa also claimed ms sarah had insinuated in an online talk show on june 7 that pa's staff and volunteers did not find anything wrong with the standee as they might be ""blind to racism"". she had been asked by host walid jumblatt abdullah, an assistant professor from nanyang technological university, whether she would accept an invitation from mr yong to meet in person if he had made such an offer. ms sarah replied she would, wondered if the mp had seen the standee, and added that ""something is definitely wrong"" if he had seen the standee and did not say anything about it. she also referred to someone's comment about internalised racism, and spoke about how some people are blind to racism, or feel there is nothing wrong with racism as it does not impact them. in its post, the pa stressed it remains steadfast in its mission to promote racial harmony, and that its grassroots organisations, such as the malay activity executive committees council and narpani pearavai, play a key role in representing the interests of the malay and indian communities. ""we regularly reach out to numerous community partners among all our races and religions to ensure their concerns are actively considered when designing our programmes,"" it added. the pa also said that what happened at radin mas was an isolated incident, but nevertheless shows that it can fall short. ""we agree it is important for our staff and volunteers to be sensitive to and knowledgeable about the cultures of all our ethnic groups.  we are now looking at establishing a resource panel to guide and advise our staff on cultural matters,"" it said. ""we will also step up training efforts to enhance staff and volunteers' understanding and appreciation of our different cultures.  singaporeans becoming 'one people' is a work in progress and so is the pa. ""the pa also said ms sarah's allegation in her e-mail on june 1, that the pa was ""hasty in sharing the name of the vendor"" to ""distance and deflect blame"" from itself, was untrue. it said the vendor had identified himself directly to ms sarah on may 28 and apologised, before the pa issued its statement on may 29. the straits times has contacted ms sarah for comment. she had written on instagram on june 1, after acknowledging pa's apology: ""as an ethnic minority, this isn't new seeing others have a superficial understanding of my culture and then feeling like i have to explain it is. . .  exhausting.  but i want to help bridge that gap where possible through real and respectful conversations so that we can move beyond superficial understanding and promote deeper social cohesion. ""a post shared by sarah bagharib (@sarahbagharib)in her june 7 talk show, she also said she had spoken up about the incident as she would like to see more ""tangible accountability"" from the pa to ensure such incidents do not happen again. this includes hearing about steps that they will take. she also noted that when minorities speak up about their experiences, they are not doing so in order to incite racial disharmony. the pa said in its post: ""enhancing our understanding of singapore's various races, religions and cultures is a ceaseless effort this lapse having been a good reminder of this. . .  we hope that this incident will not tar the other good work which our staff and volunteers have done.

															afp london: england launched their bid for euro 2020 glory with a 1-0 win over croatia on sunday, as scotland were set to end their 23-year wait to play in a major tournament and covid-hit spain prepared to face sweden. raheem sterling scored at a sun-baked wembley as england won their opening game of a european championship finals for the first time at the 10th attempt. england's neighbours scotland, playing at the highest level for the first time since the 1998 world cup, will face the czech republic in glasgow on monday, before a new-look spain get their bid for a record fourth european crown underway without captain sergio busquets who tested positive for coronavirus. but the action on the pitch is still being overshadowed by the fallout from the shocking events in copenhagen's parken stadium on saturday when christian eriksen suddenly collapsed during denmark's group b loss to finland, lying motionless as medics administered cpr. the match resumed nearly two hours later following a suspension after reports filtered through that eriksen was in a stable condition and awake. ""he was gone, and we did cardiac resuscitation, and it was cardiac arrest,"" team doctor morten boesen told a press conference on sunday. ""how close were we? i don't know.  we got him back after one defib (defibrillation), so that's quite fast. ""denmark forward martin braithwaite called the incident ""one of the scariest moments of my life"". ""i'm grateful that he's stable and alive.  right now, that's all that matters.  hope to see you soon my friend,"" he tweeted. england make winning starton sunday, manchester city's sterling scored his first goal at a major tournament as england gained a measure of revenge for their 2018 world cup semi-final defeat by croatia. the forward's sharp finish in the second half was enough for the home side to send the wembley crowd home happy. sterling grew up in the shadow of london's wembley and justified manager gareth southgate's decision to keep faith with him by scoring the only goal just before the hour. ""i always said if i played at wembley in a major tournament, i'm scoring.  i had to score in my back garden and delighted to do that,"" he told the bbc. england, seeking to end a 55-year wait for a major trophy, are playing all three group games at their london home.  if they top group d they will also play there in the last 16, while london is also the venue for both semi-finals as well as the final on july 11. the netherlands, back at a major tournament for the first time since 2014, defeated ukraine 3-2 in a thrilling group c encounter in amsterdam. dutch captain georginio wijnaldum put the hosts ahead early in the second half before wout weghorst doubled their advantage. ukraine equalised with two quick goals from andriy yarmolenko and roman yaremchuk, but a denzel dumfries header five minutes from time earned frank de boer's side victory. north macedonia lost 3-1 to austria in their first match in a major tournament as an independent nation in bucharest, despite an equaliser from 37-year-old captain goran pandev. scotland set to celebrate returnscotland's match in group d has been slightly overshadowed by the racism ban which ruled czech defender ondrej kudela out of the tournament. the slavia prague player was suspended for 10 games for racially abusing rangers midfielder glen kamara on a europa league visit to scotland in march. ""i believe that he did not tell him anything racist, there was no evidence, but a lot of people on the islands (the uk) condemned him and he received a severe sentence,"" said czech republic and west ham midfielder tomas soucek. but scotland's fans will be sure to celebrate at hampden park, with their side finally back in the big time. ""i hope it inspires a nation, i hope we can make them happy.  you can feel a real buzz around the country already,"" said scotland captain andy robertson. the coronavirus, which delayed the tournament for a year, is still proving a major headache. portugal defender joao cancelo has tested positive for covid-19 and is out of euro 2020, with diogo dalot taking his place in the squad. spain's preparations have been badly hit by the virus, with busquets missing for monday's clash with sweden in seville, while defender diego llorente was only allowed to rejoin the group on saturday after giving a fourth consecutive negative test. ""it's been a tough week, without doubt, but no complaints, no excuses,"" said spain coach luis enrique. the other opening group e game sees robert lewandowski's poland face slovakia in saint petersburg. world cup holders france -- with karim benzema recalled -- are the favourites to win the continental crown. they begin their campaign against germany in munich on tuesday, with holders portugal facing hungary in the other group f match. kalasin: a college student died after crashing his motorcycle into the rear of a stationary pickup in muang district of this northeastern province late on monday night, police said. samut prakan: a 73-year-old retired police officer died on monday, five days after receiving a shot of astrazenica covid-19 vaccine, police said. washington: the chinese scientist at the center of theories that the coronavirus pandemic originated with a leak from her specialized lab in the city of wuhan has denied her institution was to blame for the health disaster.

2021-06-15,Private-sector economists raise Singaporeâs 2021 growth forecast again to 6.5%: MAS survey.,"singapore: private-sector economists have once again raised their 2021 growth forecasts for the singapore economy, according to the latest quarterly survey by the monetary authority of singapore (mas) released on monday (jun 14). the 24 economists polled are expecting the economy to grow 6. 5 per cent this year, up from theearlier forecast of 5. 8 per centand the second upgrade they have made in six months. this is also higher than the 4 per cent to 6 per cent forecast range that the ministry of trade and industry left unchanged last month, citing ""heightened uncertainties"" arising from the global covid-19 pandemic. singapore saw a spike in local community infections in recent months and on may 16 tightened restrictions under what authorities called aphase 2 (heightened alert)in order to stem transmissions.  this included increasing the cap on social gatherings to two people, banning dining-in at restaurants and returning to work-from-home as the default. some of these tightened measures werelifted on mondayas the number of community cases fell, with the limit on group sizes back up to five people.  if the situation remains under control, dine-ins will once again be possible from jun 21. economists had previously said the temporary move to tighten curbswould not throw the economic recovery off course. in the latest mas survey released on monday, they pencilled in year-on-year growth of 15 per cent for the second quarter which lasts from april to june.  this is higher than the earlier estimate of 14. 6 per cent. for the year ahead, the manufacturing sector remains a key bright spot in the economy. the sector, which makes up about one-fifth of singapore's economy, is expected to grow 8. 3 per cent, well above the forecast of 4. 7 per cent three months ago. the outlook also brightened for the finance and insurance sector at 6 per cent, a slight upgrade from the 5. 8 per cent in the previous survey; as well as for non-oil domestic exports which is seen rising 7. 5 per cent this year compared with the last 6. 9 per cent estimate. the battered construction sector remains on track for a recovery this year, although its growth outlook has been trimmed to 19. 3 per cent from 22. 5 per cent previously. among the others with a dimmer outlook, growth for the accommodation and food services sector is now at 6. 5 per cent, nearly halving from the 11 per cent expected three months ago. expectations for private consumption is also down to 5. 2 per cent from 7. 9 per cent, while wholesale and retail trade is seen rising 4. 4 per cent, down marginally from the last 4. 5 per cent forecast. the labour market is set to improve marginally as economists expect the unemployment rate to reach 2. 7 per cent by the end of the year, compared with the earlier expected 2. 9 per cent. an escalation of the covid-19 situation remained the top downside risk to growth, said the economists.  this is followed by geopolitical tensions and a slower-than-expected labour market recovery that could weigh on private consumption. as for upside risks, these include a containment of the pandemic, a stronger-than-expected performance from the manufacturing sector and the possibility of borders reopening for international travel. further ahead in 2022, the singapore economy is set to expand by 4 per cent. the mas survey was sent out on may 25 to close private-sector watchers of the singapore economy.  the findings do not represent the central bank's views or forecasts, it said. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-15,Trial of Myanmarâs Aung San Suu Kyi gets under way.,"detained politician faces a string of charges, including accepting illegal payments and violating colonial-era law. the trial of deposed myanmar leader aung san suu kyi began on monday, more than four months after the military seized power in a coup. the military regime has brought an eclectic mix of charges against aung san suu kyi, who was returned to office after her national league for democracy won a landslide victory in elections last november, including claims she accepted illegal payments of gold and violated a colonial-era secrecy law. a special court in naypyidaw, the capital, heard a police major testify that the 75-year-old broke coronavirus restrictions while campaigning during the polls, while another testified on separate charges accusing her of illegally importing and possessing walkie-talkies, her lawyer min min soe told afp news agency. aung san suu kyi was hit with additional corruption charges last week over claims she illegally accepted $600,000 in cash and approximately 11kg (24. 2 pounds) of gold. journalists were barred from proceedings in court, and an afp reporter said there was a heavy police presence outside. aung san suu kyi's lawyers, who have struggled to gain access to their client, say they expect the trial to wrap up by july 26. a separate trial is scheduled to start on tuesday over sedition charges she faces alongside overthrown president win myint and another senior member of the nld. if convicted of all charges, aung san suu kyi faces more than a decade in jail. ""it is a show trial motivated only by political reasons,"" said debbie stothard, coordinator of the alternative asean network on burma. ""min aung hlaing [military chief] is determined to lock up aung san suu kyi for the rest of her life.  if he could, he would probably charge her under every law available. ""human rights watch said the allegations were ""bogus and politically motivated"" with the intention of nullifying the nld victory and preventing aung san suu kyi from running for office again. ""this trial is clearly the opening salvo in an overall strategy to neuter suu kyi and the national league for democracy party as a force that can challenge military rule in the future,"" said deputy asia director phil robertson. near-daily protests have rocked myanmar since the generals' february 1 putsch.  a mass uprising has been met with a brutal military crackdown that has killed more than 850 civilians, according to a local monitoring group. analysts say army chief min aung hlaing determined to sideline hugely popular leader and reshape political landscape. military attacks have forced villagers into the jungle and stiffened the resolve of those fighting against the coup. protesters demand firmer action against military leaders' february power grab and recognition of civilian government. men in embattled town of mindat flee to the hills as military steps up crackdown on resistance to february 1 coup. follow al jazeera

2021-06-15,"Jewel Changi Airport reopens to public; over 2,500 workers have tested negative for Covid-19, Singapore News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore more than 2,500 workers have been tested for covid-19 at jewel changi airport, which reopened on monday (june 14) after a month-long closure.  all the test results were negative. close to 90 per cent of eligible staff have also taken at least one dose of the coronavirus vaccine, the mall management said on monday. to help businesses affected by the closure, full rental waiver will be extended by another week, from monday to sunday, said ms hung jean, chief executive of jewel changi airport development. additional rental assistance will also be given to tenants for the week of june 21 to june 27.  jewel did not say how much additional assistance it will provide. said ms hung: ""we are cognisant that it will take time to ramp up footfall at jewel as singapore cautiously moves into phase 3 (heightened alert) with a gradual easing of restrictions. ""precautionary measures have also been stepped up.  this includes the purging of air-conditioned air two hours before opening hours. during the closure period, thorough cleaning and disinfection of the premises, including tenanted spaces, was carried out, although no covid-19 cases were detected at jewel. visitors mostly families with young children started arriving as shops and eateries in the mall began to open at about 10am. while the spectre of the recent covid-19 outbreak at changi airport that led to the month-long closure continues to linger on the minds of some business owners, customers who spoke to the straits times were assured by the measures put in place to prevent another outbreak. mrs chua zi yun, 30, who was at jewel with her husband and their two sons, age three and one, said it was the same as visiting any other shopping mall. ""they have already cleaned the place and sanitised everything and it is not open to the terminal buildings where they are receiving foreigners, so i think it is quite safe,"" said the civil servant. ""it is a good place for the kids to run around, so that's why we are here even though we live in the west.  i figured there wouldn't be a lot of people today since it is the first day (of reopening). ""mrs chua added: ""if we just do our part, wear our masks and do not go too close to other people, i think we will be fine. ""a technician who wanted to be known only as mr raemi, 52, was at the mall on his day off with his wife.  he shared the same sentiments. ""(the closure) was for the common good.  it needed to be done.  i'm not worried.  i believe the authorities have done a thorough deep cleaning,"" he said. mr raemi added that he and his wife had been looking forward to jewel's reopening and had travelled from their home in western singapore to the mall. ""we do enjoy our time here.  there are not many places where you can have the luxury of space and (have everything) under one roof. ""some tenants, such as burger joint shake shack, were encouraged by the initial turnout on monday and expect sales to pick up over the weekend. others, however, said they foresee business to be slow given the continued ban on dining in and the dearth of tourists at the mall.

besides stepping up its precautionary measures, jewel is also offering free parking from 10am to 11pm daily to attract visitors.  the mall is open 24 hours, but most shops operate from 10am to 10pm. shake shack singapore's operations director cami soh said the free parking, which will last until july 11, will go some way towards getting people back into the mall and is also good for deliverymen.  while she could not share any sales figures, ms soh said she was happy with how the first day of reopening had gone. ""initially, we thought that people would be afraid of coming to jewel after the outbreak, but we are seeing crowds. . .  we think we will do even better over the next few days,"" she added. ms soh said she expects sales to pick up even further once dining in is allowed to resume.  this is slated to take place from june 21. mr mark shaw, director of shaw organisation, which operates the shaw theatres chain, said what has hurt the firm's bottom line is the lack of concession sales due to the ban on dining in.  he added: ""all cinemas are very dependent on selling soft drinks and popcorn.  obviously we're slightly disappointed that (dining in) hasn't reopened together with the theatres, (but) we are quite confident that jewel's management and their marketing teams will be on point and get it out there that jewel is open for business. ""caerus holding, which manages local outlets of luke's lobster and confectionery chain lady m, said sales have slowed as it was not only hit by jewel's closure but also by the temporary closure of westgate, where it has a lady m outlet. said its chief operating officer geraldine liew: ""while we're definitely glad about the declining community cases and the return of dining in, we do foresee lower mall traffic. ""jewel was shut on may 13 along with changi airport terminals 1 and 3 to stem the spread of a growing covid-19 cluster that originated from terminal 3.

the risk of a further outbreak at the airport, and at jewel, appears to have abated as the most recent cases linked to the t3 cluster tested positive on may 22 more than three weeks ago. in all, 108 people, including 43 airport workers, were infected. the civil aviation authority of singapore and changi airport group (cag) said last friday that deep cleaning and disinfection of jewel and the passenger terminals was completed and new safety measures segregating 14,000 airport workers into three distinct zones based on risk level are in place. the airport's passenger terminal buildings will remain closed to the public to allow the airport community to adjust to the new zoning system, the authorities had said. âsome businesses at the passenger terminals and jewel told the straits times earlier this month that they have adapted to disruptions brought on by the pandemic in the past year, such as by reducing the number of staff at the airport and switching to online sales. some have settled for just covering their costs as they await a recovery in air travel. the full rental waiver provided by cag during the period of closure, as well as the government's additional wage support from april to this month, has provided much-needed relief. the manager of a food and beverage outlet at jewel said on monday that he was glad to reopen after being forced to close for the past month. the 35-year-old, who declined to be named, told st that the sudden closure of jewel last month led to a week's worth of inventory going to waste. while the outlet was able to do deliveries and takeaways during the eight-week circuit breaker last year, they were not able to do so during the month-long closure of jewel, leading to an 80 per cent fall in sales. the f&b outlet has had to run on a lean team of just five people for fear of another closure or lockdown. reopening brings with it another set of challenges ensuring patrons comply with safe distancing measures, he said.  still, the manager was glad to be back at work. ""for us tenants, at least there is something for us to do now instead of staying at home,"" he said. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright Â© 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-15,Myanmarâs detained Aung San Suu Kyi to face Naypyidaw court.,"analysts say army chief min aung hlaing determined to sideline hugely popular leader and reshape politics free of her influence. after five years as the de facto leader of myanmar, aung san suu kyi finds herself in a familiar place: under house arrest while facing an eclectic mix of charges levelled by military rulers, with her party, the national league for democracy (nld), on the verge of dissolution. on monday, more than four months after the military seized power in a coup, the hugely popular politician will face trial in a naypyidaw court on five charges including the illegal possession of walkie-talkies and breaking coronavirus restrictions while campaigning for elections.  military officials have also accused her of corruption and violating the colonial-era official secrets act. there is a sense of finality about this showdown between aung san suu kyi, and army chief and coup leader, min aung hlaing. at 75 years old, aung san suu kyi is facing prison sentences that could put her in jail for the rest of her life, permanently sidelining her from a political arena she has defined for decades.  meanwhile, many of her supporters have moved beyond her past calls for non-violent resistance and gradual reform, instead endorsing armed revolt and the total overthrow of the military regime. ""this time around, there is no indication that the regime plans to release aung san suu kyi, allow her to communicate with her supporters, or use her as a bargaining chip in its relations with the outside world.  rather, min aung hlaing wants to have a free hand to shape the political landscape free from the influence of her and the nld,"" said richard horsey, a political analyst with decades of experience in myanmar. despite being largely shut off from the outside world for the last four months, she still occupies a central role in the continuing political crisis.  before the generals violently cracked down on protests, killing more than 850 civilians, posters and banners featuring aung san suu kyi's face were a mainstay at most demonstrations. analysts say army chief min aung hlaing, right, wants to remove aung san suu kyi and the nld from the political landscape [file: myawaddy/afp]""it's far too early to write her off.  she is, without a doubt, by far the most popular political figure in the country, no one else even comes close,"" said thant myint-u, historian and author of the hidden history of burma. aung san suu kyi emerged as a political force during the 1988 uprisings against a previous military regime, perfectly primed to take the helm of myanmar's pro-democracy movement during a period of instability.  the daughter of independence icon aung san, she had just returned from the united kingdom, where she had studied at oxford and married a british man. she became synonymous with myanmar's pro-democracy movement and earned the respect of millions by sacrificing her freedom and safety for the cause, winning the nobel peace prize in 1991.  she spent years in and out of house arrest and survived an assassination attempt in 2003 that left dozens, possibly hundreds, dead.  aung san suu kyi's education and international recognition was also a source of admiration for many of her followers. but while this was a strength in the eyes of many, it was an insult to the ultra-nationalist military, also known as the tatmadaw, which often insulted the ""foreigner's wife"". in 2008, before allowing elections, the military regime drafted a new constitution that allowed it to retain control of several key institutions and guaranteed it 25 percent of the seats in parliament.  it also added a clause banning anyone with a foreign husband or child from serving as president, which many saw as being directly aimed at aung san suu kyi. with the help of a constitutional lawyer named ko ni, she found a way around this prohibition, taking on the role of state counsellor after the nld's first election victory in 2015.  two years later, ko ni was shot dead. but while she was a global superstar as an activist, many of her biggest supporters were disappointed once she was in power. in 2017, hundreds of thousands of mostly muslim rohingya fled into bangladesh as the military unleashed a brutal crackdown in the western state of rakhine. the nobel prize winner did not condemn the military's actions and, after a case of genocide was brought before the international court of justice in the hague, she travelled to the netherlands to defend what the generals had done. ""aung san suu kyi's domestic popularity only grew as she transitioned from dissident to national leader.  internationally, she fell spectacularly from grace as a result of the violence against the rohingya, in which she was seen as complicit by denying the extent of abuses and defending the military,"" said horsey. aung san suu kyi returned home to care for her mother and found herself propelled into politics leading opposition to military rule [file: manny ceneta/afp]activist and protest leader thinzar shunlei yi is one of many young human rights defenders who grew up idolising aung san suu kyi, only to be let down by her time in power. ""she was the reason why i became a woman human rights defender,"" she said.  but as violence against the rohingya grew, thinzar shunlei yi became one of the only people to speak out against it, putting her at odds with her hero and her throngs of supporters. ""i was outspoken against her and got a lot of backfire,"" she said. it was not just during the rohingya crisis where aung san suu kyi failed to live up to expectations.  ""she was also seen as deserting her human rights principles when in government in other ways, including her treatment of the free media, civil society and ethnic minority rights,"" horsey explained. when two reuters journalists were arrested for exposing the military killings of rohingya civilians, aung san suu kyi said the case ""had nothing to do with freedom of expression at all"".  during her time in power, journalists and facebook users faced criminal charges for criticising nld politicians. with nld leadership scattered or in prison after the coup, more progressive activists like thinzar shunlei yi found themselves spearheading the initial resistance movement.  they called for increasingly radical change, like abolishing the military-drafted constitution of 2008, the complete removal of the military from politics, the reform of the discriminatory 1982 citizenship law that helped render the rohingya stateless, and armed revolution rather than non-violent resistance. these positions were eventually endorsed by the national unity government, a parallel government set up by elected legislators in defiance of the military regime.  thinzar shunlei yi recognised that aung san suu kyi is still ""so influential"" in the pro-democracy movement, but also worried that her influence could be double-edged. ""even in this revolution, where many people go starving and running for their lives, people still think about her situation and weep for her,"" she said.  this can help motivate people even when they are beleaguered and losing hope. but aung san suu kyi might not agree with the armed revolt, abolishing the constitution, or accepting the rohingya as citizens.  ""we wonder what if she says something against the current revolution, things would go upside down,"" thinzar shunlei yi said. people hold placards of aung san suu kyi in a rally to demand her release and protest against the military coup a week after the generals seized power [file: stringer/reuters]while some have argued that aung san suu kyi backed the military on the rohingya crisis due to fear of a coup or a need to appeal to a nationalist voter base, others say her position simply reflected her genuine beliefs on the issue. ""it's not at all clear that her position on the rohingya was driven by political considerations,"" horsey said.  ""but it certainly meant that, at the time of the coup, she had a much-diminished international reputation at a time when she needed international support the most. ""altogether, aung san suu kyi is facing seven criminal charges; five in the capital city of naypyidaw, one at the supreme court and a recently added corruption charge. her lawyers are among the only people who have had access to the detained leader since her arrest in february.  the leader of her legal team, khin maung zaw, told al jazeera they met with aung san suu kyi and deposed president win myint on june 7.  khin maung zaw said the five cases in naypyidaw were classified as ""simple"", with hearings to be held every monday and tuesday until the end of the month. for the supreme court case, he said the court marked aung san suu kyi down as defending herself, something khin maung zaw said was done ""without her knowledge and consent"". ""she further said that she told the persons who kept her in custody that she wouldn't defend her cases without a lawyer,"" he said. he said that while aung san suu kyi has not been satisfied with the military's arrangement to deliver her medicine regularly, she and the other two politicians ""seemed to be in good health"". when asked about her spirits, khin maung zaw said, ""unlike me, she's full of optimism"". on wednesday, the military revealed new corruption charges against aung san suu kyi for allegedly taking bribes and leasing land at discounted rates, which carry an additional prison sentence of 15 years. khin maung zaw said the latest accusation is ""absurd"" and ""groundless"".  ""she might have defects but personal greed and corruption is not her traits,"" he said, calling her ""incorruptible"". michael aris, the late husband of aung san suu kyi, stands with their two sons alexander, left, and kim, right, at the nobel prize ceremony in oslo town hall on december 10, 1991 [stringer/reuters]given the nature of the trials, thinzar shunlei yi calls on aung san suu kyi to ""join cdm"" by ""boycotting the judicial system"".  cdm stands for the civil disobedience movement, a mass strike of civil servants refusing to work under the military regime. ""i don't trust the domestic judicial system and i don't think the [military] will do a fair trial for her and other leaders,"" she said. while the outcome of the trial appears inevitable, thant myint-u says that what happened in myanmar was not. ""there was no way the army was going to agree to constitutional reform,"" thant myint-u said.  ""but a visionary economic agenda that brought in billions in fresh investment and created millions of new jobs, together with measures to fight discrimination, build a more inclusive national identity, and work closely with civil society, could have outflanked the army leadership, and perhaps even won over many in the officer corps. ""al jazeera takes a look at the leader's life and how she went from being an icon of democracy to courting controversy. what we know so far about monday's coup in myanmar. why did myanmar's military

2021-06-15,"Lack of expectation may be good for Spain: Luis Garcia, Latest Football News.","former spain midfielder luis garcia believes the fact that la furia roja are not among the favourites to win euro 2020 could work in their favour. after a week without training and three years of upheaval, spain head into their opener against sweden tomorrow morning (singapore time) determined to leave the past behind. luis enrique was appointed to ring the changes in the aftermath of the 2018 world cup, when going out on penalties to russia had made it three consecutive failures to reach the quarter-finals of a major tournament. spain's preparations for the euros have been hardly ideal, with captain sergio busquets and defender diego llorente testing covid-19 positive, although the latter has since received four consecutive negative tests and been allowed to rejoin the squad. due to the positive tests, their final warm-up match against lithuania was played by spain's under-21s, with the senior team in isolation and unable to train together. ahead of their clash with sweden, who have also seen their plans disrupted by the positive tests for dejan kulusevski and mattias svanberg, former champions league winner garcia told indian media: ""it can be an advantage. ""we have seen many times that when the spotlight is not on you, the players arrive with a little less pressure. ""(when you are favourites) the media brings the pressure when you play. . . ""everyone expected them to perform the way they did in 2008, 2010 and 2012,"" he said, in reference to spain's two european championship wins, which sandwiched their maiden world cup triumph. he added: ""at the moment, spain probably don't look like favourites.  (but) for me, they are good enough. ""we have got very good players thiago (alcantara) in midfield will be key.  he is a player who can create something out of nothing. ""there are players like (striker) gerard moreno who can kill the game in a single second because he has been fantastic this whole season. ""cesc fabregas, who was involved in spain's era of success from 2008-2012, also was optimistic about enrique's charges, who are the fifth-youngest team at the euros. he told goal. com: ""i don't like it when we are complaining before the tournament starts about the squad. ""i had it in 2008 when i was 21, i think.  there was (david) silva and (andres) iniesta coming through, and everyone was doubting us a bit because raul (gonzalez), (michel) salgado, (santiago) canizares and (david) albelda weren't called up. ""all those players were cast aside to make space for us young players. ""we ended up winning the tournament and i don't think i need to repeat what happened after. . .  it will not be easy for spain. . .  it is a young team but they have proven that they can play well in qualification.

2021-06-15,"As US COVID-19 death toll nears 600,000, racial gaps persist.","washington: jerry ramos spent his final days in a california hospital, hooked to an oxygen machine with blood clots in his lungs from covid-19, his 3-year-old daughter in his thoughts. ""i have to be here to watch my princess grow up,"" the mexican american restaurant worker wrote on facebook.  ""my heart feels broken into pieces. ""ramos didn't live to see it.  he died feb 15 at age 32, becoming not just one of the nearly 600,000 americans who have now perished in the coronavirus outbreak but another example of the outbreak's strikingly uneven and ever-shifting toll on the nation's racial and ethnic groups. the approaching 600,000 mark, as tracked by johns hopkins university, is greater than the population of baltimore or milwaukee.  it is about equal to the number of americans who died of cancer in 2019.  and as bad as that is, the true toll is believed to be significantly higher. president joe biden acknowledged the milestone on monday (jun 14) during his visit to europe, saying that while new cases and deaths are dropping dramatically in the us, ""there's still too many lives being lost"", and ""now is not the time to let our guard down"". on the way to the latest round-number milestone, the virus has proved adept at exploiting inequalities in the us, according to an associated press data analysis. in the first wave of fatalities, in april 2020, black people were slammed, dying at rates higher than those of other ethnic or racial groups as the virus rampaged through the urban northeast and heavily african american cities like detroit and new orleans. last summer, during a second surge, hispanics were hit the hardest, suffering an outsize share of deaths, driven by infections in texas and florida.  by winter, during the third and most lethal stage, the virus had gripped the entire nation, and racial gaps in weekly death rates had narrowed so much that whites were the worst off, followed closely by hispanics. now, even as the outbreak ebbs and more people get vaccinated, a racial gap appears to be emerging again, with black americans dying at higher rates than other groups. overall, black and hispanic americans have less access to medical care and are in poorer health, with higher rates of conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure.  they are also more likely to have jobs deemed essential, less able to work from home and more likely to live in crowded, multigenerational households, where working family members are apt to expose others to the virus. black people account for 15 per cent of all covid-19 deaths where race is known, while hispanics represent 19 per cent, whites 61 per cent and asian americans 4 per cent.  those figures are close to the groups' share of the us population black people at 12 per cent, hispanics 18 per cent, whites 60 per cent and asians 6 per cent but adjusting for age yields a clearer picture of the unequal burden. because blacks and hispanics are younger on average than whites, it would stand to reason that they would be less likely to die from a disease that has been brutal to the elderly.  but that's not what is happening. instead, the centers for disease control and prevention, adjusting for population age differences, estimates that native americans, latinos and blacks are two to three times more likely than white people to die of covid-19. also, the ap analysis found that latinos are dying at much younger ages than other groups. thirty-seven per cent of hispanic deaths were of those under 65, versus 12 per cent for white americans and 30 per cent for black people.  hispanic people between 30 and 39 like ramos have died at five times the rate of white people in the same age group. public health experts see these disparities as a loud message that the nation needs to address deep-rooted inequities. ""if we want to respect the dear price that 600,000 people have paid, don't return to normal.  return to something that is better than what was,"" said dr clyde yancy, vice dean for diversity and inclusion at northwestern university's medical school in chicago. he added: ""it will be an epic fail if we simply go back to whatever we call normal. ""ramos had asthma and diabetes and had quit his job as a chef at red lobster before the pandemic because of diabetes-related trouble with his feet. he died during the devastating winter surge that hit latinos hard, and the rest of his household of seven in watsonville, an agricultural city of around 54,000 people about 90 miles south of san francisco, also got sick. that included his toddler daughter; the family matriarch, 70-year-old mercedes ramos; and his girlfriend, who was the only one in the household working and the first to get infected, bringing home the virus from her job managing a marijuana dispensary, according to family members. mother and son were admitted to the same hospital, their rooms nearby.  they would video chat or call each other every day. ""he would tell me he loved me very much and that he wanted me to get better and that he was doing fine, but he was telling me that so i wouldn't worry,"" mercedes ramos said in spanish, her voice breaking.  she has since returned to her job picking strawberries. gaps in vaccination rates in the us also persist, with blacks and hispanics lagging behind, said samantha artiga of the kaiser family foundation, a nonpartisan health-policy research organisation. experts say several factors could be at work, including deep distrust of the medical establishment among black americans because of a history of discriminatory treatment, and fears of deportation among latinos, as well as a language barrier in many cases. the us was averaging about 870,000 injections per day in early june, down sharply from a high of about 3. 3 million a day on average in mid-april, according to the cdc. initial vaccine eligibility policies, set by states, favoured older americans, a group more likely to be white.  now, everyone over 12 is eligible, but obstacles remain, such as concerns about missing work because of side effects from the shot. ""eligibility certainly does not equal access,"" artiga said.  ""losing a day or two of wages can have real consequences for your family.  people are facing tough decisions like that. ""the ap's analysis of the outbreak's racial and ethnic patterns was based on national center for health statistics data on covid-19 deaths and 2019 census bureau population estimates. it's less clear who is dying now, but the still-incomplete data suggests a gap has emerged again.  in michigan, black people are 14 per cent of the population but accounted for 25 per cent of the 1,064 deaths reported in the past four weeks, according to the most recent available state data.  similar gaps were seen in florida and pennsylvania. ""for people of colour like myself, we've had deep personal experiences during the pandemic"" of caring for loved ones and sometimes losing them, said yolanda ogbolu, a nurse researcher at the university of maryland, baltimore. ogbolu, who is black, made herself an advocate for two relatives during their covid-19 hospital stays: her 50-year-old police officer brother she persuaded his doctors to treat him with the drug remdesivir and her 59-year-old repairman uncle.  she called the hospital daily during his 100-day stay. both survived.  but ogbolu wonders whether they would have lived if they hadn't had a nurse in the family. ""what happens when people don't have that person to push for them? what happens when you don't even speak the language?"" ogbolu said.  ""what happens when they don't know how to navigate the health system or what questions to ask?""downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-15,Top Chinese virologist dismisses theory Covid leaked from Wuhan lab as âfilth on an innocent scientistâ.,"a top chinese virologist facing scrutiny amid theories the covid pandemic could have originated in her lab has dismissed the concerns as ""filth"" being poured on an ""innocent scientist"". in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, shi zhengli, a scientist at the wuhan institute of virology (wiv), has been praised for helping her country curb the spread of the virus, while also being at the centre of swirling conspiracy theories over its origins. addressing the claims, the virologist, who has been dubbed ""bat woman"" by some, told the new york times there was ""no evidence"" to support the allegations against her lab. ""how on earth can i offer up evidence for something where there is no evidence?"" she said. in a text message, she also reportedly wrote: ""i don't know how the world has come to this, constantly pouring filth on an innocent scientist. ""the idea that covid-19 could have escaped from a lab has long been dismissed by members of the scientific community, while others have derided such theories due to their connection with former president donald trump. however, calls from his successor, president joe biden, for a transparent investigation into the origins of covid-19 have brought the theory back under the spotlight. and with world health organization (who) director-general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus saying during a g7 briefing on the pandemic that ""every hypothesis should be open"" in the bid to understand the origins of covid-19, it seems all lines of inquiry are on the table. scientists still generally appear to agree that there is no clear evidence to support the possibility of a lab leak leading to the spread of covid-19. however, calls for a thorough and transparent investigation have been backed by members of the scientific community, particularly in the wake of reports citing american intelligence of several employees of the wiv falling ill as the pandemic began to take root. dr shi has denied that several of her colleagues were ill before the outbreak's emergence, according to the times.  the chinese government has also not given any indication that dr shi's lab is under any degree of suspicion in connection with the coronavirus outbreak. the virologist has been able to continue her work and give lectures in the country. in a recent letter in the journal science, 18 scientists called for a transparent investigation to look into all possible scenarios, including the possibility of a lab leak. the letter also stresses the importance of a ""dispassionate science-based discourse"" on the origins of the covid-19 pandemic, with researchers noting the rise of ""anti-asian sentiment in some countries"" in the midst of the pandemic. ""in this time of unfortunate anti-asian sentiment in some countries, we note that at the beginning of the pandemic, it was chinese doctors, scientists, journalists, and citizens who shared with the world crucial information about the spread of the virus â often at great personal cost,"" the letter states. ""we should show the same determination in promoting a dispassionate science-based discourse on this difficult but important issue,"" researchers write. speaking with the times, david relman a microbiologist at stanford university who co-authored the letter, said: ""this has nothing to do with fault or guilt. """"it's just bigger than any one scientist or institute or any one country â anybody anywhere who has data of this sort needs to put it out there,"" he said. read moreworkers push back against hospitals requiring covid vaccinesus bans dogs brought in from 100 countries with rabies riskus intel report warns of more violence by qanon followerschristopher sign broke story of tarmac meeting between bill clinton and ag loretta lynch during 2016 campaign between hillary and trumpthe first-of-its kind heavy launcher aims to carry the first in a series of missions to bring humans back to the moon by 2024. have you considered how you'll withdraw your retirement income? these simple mistakes could cost you thousands of dollars. new species could have been close to seven metres in length, scientists sayazeem ahktar, 29, was jailed for eight years at harrow crown court after admitting a range of offences following a traffic stop that led to police finding a sub-machine gun and ammunition, drugs and cash at his address in brent. a 76-year-old man who had 39 wives and 94 children and was said to be the head of the world's largest family has died in north east india, the chief minister of his home state said.   ziona chana, the head of a local christian sect that allows polygamy, died on sunday, zoramthanga, the chief minister of mizoram and who goes by one name, said in a tweet.   with a total of 167 members, the family is the world's largest, according to local media, although this depends on whether you count the grandchildren, of whom ziona has 33. read this before going solar in texas.

2021-06-15,"Students negotiate a tough road towards milestone exams, Latest Singapore News.","the second nationwide home-based learning (hbl) exercise for students will come to an end in stages, the ministry of education (moe) announced yesterday. primary 4 to 6 pupils, secondary 3 to 5 and all junior college and millennia institute students will be the first to return to school on june 28.  secondary 1 and 2 students will return to school from july 1 and the rest will go back from july 6. those sitting psle and n-, o- and a-level examinations this year have had to live with the coronavirus for more than a year now and been forced to make unprecedented adjustments while preparing for the milestone tests. dr jason tan, associate professor in the policy, curriculum and leadership academic group at the national institute of education, said negotiating two hbl sessions and adjusting to various safety measures both in and out of school would have been challenging. ""these exams play an important role in determining the next stages of the students' lives and having them amid the disruptions caused by the virus is certainly not ideal,"" he told the new paper yesterday. ""this period is already a stressful one for them, knowing the importance of these exams.  faced with social isolation like being apart from their classmates and not having co-curricular activities is bound to affect their social and emotional well-being, which also plays a part in how they do academically. ""on may 16, moe announced that all students would move to hbl from may 19, the second such exercise since the virus appeared here early last year. the current mid-year holidays started on may 29 and end on june 27. last year's hbl was from april 8 to may 5, during the circuit breaker, when singapore went into a lockdown from april 7 to june 1. ms vivien le, founder of le xue education group, a chinese education centre, believes many of the students taking crucial exams this year would have found it tough. the former moe teacher said: ""this year's cohort had to go through two rounds of disruptions. ""students who find it more challenging learning online may find it difficult since a portion of their syllabus from these two years were taught online, especially when it comes to the foundation topics taught last year. ""but she noted that some learning styles may be suited to online learning. miss ren yun ting, 18, a second-year student at tampines meridian junior college, said she was productive during the recent hbl exercise as she continued preparing for her upcoming a-level exams. she said: ""the school uploaded a lot of information and resources such as mock exam papers for us to do, and i had the flexibility to plan my time on how i wanted to revise. ""while she missed meeting her friends and having fun in school, the time she saved on travelling and attending co-curricular activity sessions helped with revision work. ""i may not be able to say i am 100 per cent confident to take the exams now, but i am definitely making great use of my holidays to consolidate my learning, and i am well prepared for my upcoming exams, which is an important milestone before the a levels,"" she added. some have struggled more. madam lunny liu, 50, a tutor, said her 11-year-old daughter, who will sit the primary school leaving examination later this year, found the hbl less effective. ""she never had very good self-discipline and home-based learning made it worse.  also, it affected her understanding of some lessons taught in class because she does better with physical interaction. ""students taking the psle and n-, o- and a-level exams face huge pressure, and ms le said the pandemic could exacerbate the strain. a mother who wanted to be known only as mrs lim said despite the challenges that her 12-year-old daughter has had to face, they have learnt to adapt as the psle draws closer. the 41-year-old sales manager said: ""last year, my daughter was complaining about the safe management measures in school such as having to wear masks the whole day. ""she does not complain now and is looking forward to returning to school to prepare for her exams. ""while it has been disruptive, especially when tuition classes were shifted online, this pandemic has taught us to go with the flow and expect these constant changes.

2021-06-15,"After G7, Biden says he's re-establishing US credibility.","newquay, england: us president joe biden on sunday (jun 13) said the united states had restored its presence on the world stage as he used his first overseas trip since taking office to connect with a new generation of leaders from some of the world's most powerful countries and more closely unite allies on addressing the coronavirus pandemic and china's trade and labour practices. as he wrapped three days of what he called ""an extraordinarily collaborative and productive meeting"" at the group of seven summit of wealthy democracies, biden said there was ""genuine enthusiasm"" for his engagement. ""america's back in the business of leading the world alongside nations who share our most deeply held values,"" biden said at a news conference before leaving cornwall to visit queen elizabeth ii at windsor castle.  ""i think we've made progress in re-establishing american credibility among our closest friends. ""the president, who is on an eight-day, three country trip, left his mark on the g7 by announcing a commitment to share500 million coronavirus vaccine doseswith the world and pressing allies to do the same.  the leaders on sunday confirmed their intent todonate more than 1 billion dosesto low-income countries in the next year. ""this is going to be a constant project for a long time,"" biden said of the global vaccination campaign, adding that he hoped the world could stamp out the pandemic in 2022 or 2023.  ""it's not just the right thing to do"" from a moral standpoint, biden said, but also the correct thing to do ""in terms of our own health"". he also said the us might be able to donate an additional 1 billion vaccine doses to the world in the coming years. biden also fought for the leaders' joint statement to include specific language criticising china's use of forced labour and other human rights abuses as he worked to cast the rivalry with beijing as the defining competition for the 21st century. the president declined to discuss the private negotiations over the provision, but said he was ""satisfied"" with the tough rhetoric, though difference remained among the allies about how forcefully to call out beijing. the leaders also embraced biden's call for a 15 per cent global minimum corporate tax rate. the other g7 allies did their part in creating the impression that biden was part of ""the club"" and sought to help reinforce biden's ""america is back"" mantra, including by embracing the his campaign slogan to ""build back better"" from the pandemic. most european allies had been disenchanted with president donald trump's grumbling of ""global freeloaders"" and espousing an ""america first"" policy, so biden had the challenge of convincing a sceptical audience that the last us administration was not a harbinger of a more insular country. ""we're totally on the same page,"" british prime minister boris johnson said of biden. implicitly criticising his predecessor, who had said other countries should pay for the presence of america's military presence abroad, biden said he does not view nato as a ""protection racket"".  biden also reported that global leaders were gratified that the us president accepted the science of climate change. ""one of the things some of my colleagues said to me when i was there was, 'well, the united states' leadership recognises there is global warming,"" biden said. the president was ending his day brussels for meetings with nato and european union leaders on monday and tuesday before his summit with russian president vladimir putin on wednesday in geneva.  us officials said that one-on-one meeting would test whether the two men could develop a constructive relationship even as biden was poised to rebuke putin for a range of rights abuses and election interference. pressed at the news conference on why putin has not changed his behavior after waves of us sanctions, biden replied with a laugh.  ""he's vladimir putin. ""the summit marked some of biden's first face-to-face meetings with global leaders since taking office in january amid the covid-19 pandemic, including france's emmanuel macron, with whom he was meeting for the first time. the 43-year-old macron, who came into office in may 2017, months after biden's two terms as the us vice president ended, appeared to have quick chemistry with the 78-year-old american.  the two draped their arms around each other and chatted animatedly when they walked together after the leaders' photo at the beginning of friday's summit. in remarks to reporters, macron did not utter trump's name but offered an unambiguous shot at the former president.  macron noted his his relief that with biden, he was now working with an american president ""willing to cooperate. """"what you demonstrate is leadership is partnership,"" macron said of biden. during trump's term, macron tried to find common ground but often bristled at trump's nativist rhetoric. macron, who has worked to portray france as a more prominent power in recent years, also used the rise of trumpism to make the case for greater global european leadership. he complained in november 2019 that a lack of us leadership was causing the ""brain death"" of nato, insisting in an interview with the economist that the european union must step up and start acting as a strategic world power.  biden, in his remarks, seemed to acknowledge macron's concerns, noting that western europe was providing ""backbone and the support for nato"". biden administration officials said biden hoped to leave the summit on sunday with a communique that included language calling out china over forced labour of muslims and ethnic minorities in western china. but as talks continued on saturday, leaders said that differences remained.  the leaders broadly agreed that greater coordination on china was necessary, according to an administration official who observed some of the talks and briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity.  the official said it became evident that there was a ""spectrum of how far different countries are willing to go"". canada, the united kingdom and france largely endorsed the biden administration's position, while germany, italy and european show hesitancy, according to the official.  white house officials say biden wants the g7 nations to speak with one voice on the china's human rights abuse. ""we need to be able to deal with china in all of those areas coming from a position of strength and coming from a united position. "" us secretary of state anthony blinken told cbs news' face the nation on sunday. ""i think what the president was able to do in these last couple of days was bring countries closer together in dealing with some of the challenges posed by china. ""during the summit, biden also met with italian prime minister mario draghi, japanese prime minister yoshihide suga and president cyril ramaphosa of south africa. at the news conference, biden briefly confused syria and libya when he described the importance of providing humanitarian aid to countries torn apart by civil war.  it was among a handful of verbal stumbles the president made. biden then left on his way to windsor castle for a private audience with the queen becoming the 13th president to have met with the 95-year-old monarch. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

first overseas trip since taking office to connect with a new generation of leaders from some of the world's most powerful countries and more closely unite allies on addressing the coronavirus pandemic and china's trade and labour practices."", 'as he wrapped three days of what he called ""an extraordinarily collaborative and productive meeting"" at the group of seven summit of wealthy democracies, biden said there was ""genuine enthusiasm"" for his engagement.', '""america\'s back in the business of leading the world alongside nations who share our most deeply held values,"" biden said at a news conference before leaving cornwall to visit queen elizabeth ii at windsor castle.', '""i think we\'ve made progress in re-establishing american credibility among our closest friends.', '""the president, who is on an eight-day, three country trip, left his mark on the g7 by announcing a commitment to share500 million coronavirus vaccine doseswith the world and pressing allies to do the same.', 'the leaders on sunday confirmed their intent todonate more than 1 billion dosesto low-income countries in the next year.', '""this is going to be a constant project for a long time,"" biden said of the global vaccination campaign, adding that he hoped the world could stamp out the pandemic in 2022 or 2023.', '""it\'s not just the right thing to do"" from a moral standpoint, biden said, but also the correct thing to do ""in terms of our own health"".', 'he also said the us might be able to donate an additional 1 billion vaccine doses to the world in the coming years.', ""biden also fought for the leaders' joint statement to include specific language criticising china's use of forced labour and other human rights abuses as he worked to cast the rivalry with beijing as the defining competition for the 21st century."", 'the president declined to discuss the private negotiations over the provision, but said he was ""satisfied"" with the tough rhetoric, though difference remained among the allies about how forcefully to call out beijing.', ""the leaders also embraced biden's call for a 15 per cent global minimum corporate tax rate."", 'the other g7 allies did their part in creating the impression that biden was part of ""the club"" and sought to help reinforce biden\'s ""america is back"" mantra, including by embracing the his campaign slogan to ""build back better"" from the pandemic.', 'most european allies had been disenchanted with president donald trump\'s grumbling of ""global freeloaders"" and espousing an ""america first"" policy, so biden had the challenge of convincing a sceptical audience that the last us administration was not a harbinger of a more insular country.', '""we\'re totally on the same page,"" british prime minister boris johnson said of biden.', 'implicitly criticising his predecessor, who had said other countries should pay for the presence of america\'s military presence abroad, biden said he does not view nato as a ""protection racket"".', 'biden also reported that global leaders were gratified that the us president accepted the science of climate change.', '""one of the things some of my colleagues said to me when i was there was, \'well, the united states\' leadership recognises there is global warming,"" biden said.', 'the president was ending his day brussels for meetings with nato and european union leaders on monday and tuesday before his summit with russian president vladimir putin on wednesday in geneva.', 'us officials said that one-on-one meeting would test whether the two men could develop a constructive relationship even as biden was poised to rebuke putin for a range of rights abuses and election interference.', 'pressed at the news conference on why putin has not changed his behavior after waves of us sanctions, biden replied with a laugh.', '""he\'s vladimir putin.', '""the summit marked some of biden\'s first face-to-face meetings with global leaders since taking office in january amid the covid-19 pandemic, including france\'s emmanuel macron, with whom he was meeting for the first time.', ""the 43-year-old macron, who came into office in may 2017, months after biden's two terms as the us vice president ended, appeared to have quick chemistry with the 78-year-old american."", ""the two draped their arms around each other and chatted animatedly when they walked together after the leaders' photo at the beginning of friday's summit."", ""in remarks to reporters, macron did not utter trump's name but offered an unambiguous shot at the former president."", 'macron noted his his relief that with biden, he was now working with an american president ""willing to cooperate.', '""""what you demonstrate is leadership is partnership,"" macron said of biden.', ""during trump's term, macron tried to find common ground but often bristled at trump's nativist rhetoric."", 'macron, who has worked to portray france as a more prominent power in recent years, also used the rise of trumpism to make the case for greater global european leadership.', 'he complained in november 2019 that a lack of us leadership was causing the ""brain death"" of nato, insisting in an interview with the economist that the european union must step up and start acting as a strategic world power.', 'biden, in his remarks, seemed to acknowledge macron\'s concerns, noting that western europe was providing ""backbone and the support for nato"".', 'biden administration officials said biden hoped to leave the summit on sunday with a communique that included language calling out china over forced labour of muslims and ethnic minorities in western china.', 'but as talks continued on saturday, leaders said that differences remained.', 'the leaders broadly agreed that greater coordination on china was necessary, according to an administration official who observed some of the talks and briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity.', 'the official said it became evident that there was a ""spectrum of how far different countries are willing to go"".', ""canada, the united kingdom and france largely endorsed the biden administration's position, while germany, italy and european show hesitancy, according to the official."", ""white house officials say biden wants the g7 nations to speak with one voice on the china's human rights abuse."", '""we need to be

2021-06-15,"157 suspected serious reactions to Covid-19 jabs reported out of nearly 3.7 million doses given in Singapore, Singapore News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore there have been 157 reports here of suspected reactions to the covid-19 vaccine severe enough to be life-threatening or result in hospitalisation, among other serious conditions. however, no deaths have been linked to the jab, the health sciences authority (hsa) said on friday (june 11). these ""suspected serious adverse events"" made up 0. 004 per cent of the almost 3. 7 million doses of pfizer-biontech and moderna jabs administered till may 23. these serious cases form part of the 4,704 ""suspected adverse events reports"" that hsa received till may 23. this translates into 0. 13 per cent of administered doses, which is consistent with the percentage that had been reported by the authority on may 6, when it last gave an update on the safety record of both mrna vaccines on may 6. these reactions are suspected to be associated with the vaccinations, but may not have been caused by them. an adverse event  or reaction related to vaccination is any undesirable medical condition that occurs after taking the vaccine, which does not necessarily have a direct link to the treatment.  they may be coincidental or related to an undiagnosed disease, but have to be reported by healthcare providers to hsa. reactions are considered serious if they result in hospitalisation, disability or life-threatening illnesses, among other things. anaphylaxis, which is the rapid onset of severe allergic reactions, was the most frequently reported serious adverse event, with 26 such cases.  all of them recovered after medical treatment, hsa said. it added that the incidence rate of anaphylaxis reported here with the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines is about 0. 85 cases for every 100,000 doses of the jabs administered.  ""this is similar to the incidence rates reported overseas of around 0. 5 to two per 100,000 doses administered,"" said hsa. other severe allergic reactions numbered 23.  these include breathing difficulty, fast heart rate, an increase or decrease in blood pressure, chest discomfort and pain, fainting, limb numbness and weakness or pain, changes in vision, increase in liver enzymes, joint pain, fits, ringing in the ears and infections. the authority said most of those who had developed serious adverse events have recovered or are recovering.  ""these serious adverse events are being closely monitored by hsa,"" it added. hsa said that the most commonly reported reactions are consistent with those typically observed following vaccination. from the 4,704 reactions, the most common one was cases of rash, which accounted for more than one in four reported adverse events.  this was followed by cases of swelling of eyelids, face or lips, which occurred in about one in seven cases. these are typically resolved within a few days and are in line with the events described in the covid-19 vaccines product information, as well as those reported overseas. most of adverse events were associated with the pfizer-biontech vaccine, which was rolled out for use here on dec 30 last year and comprised 83 per cent of the doses administered.  moderna was deployed on march 12 this year. about 68 per cent of the total number of reactions reported was among people below the age of 60. hsa pointed out that trials of the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines found that those younger than 60 tend to experience more adverse effects occurring soon after vaccination, compared with those older. generally, younger people have more active immune responses and may experience more adverse effects to the vaccines, said hsa.  it pointed out that this is part of the body's natural response to build immunity against covid-19 infection. the authority added that 64 per cent of these reactions were reported in females. its update also noted that a greater frequency of heart attacks and strokes has not been observed in vaccinated persons locally. this comes after it was announced on friday that six people have been reported to have suffered heart inflammation after receiving covid-19 vaccines four of whom were men aged below 30. as a precaution, experts have advised that vaccinated people, especially adolescents and younger men, should avoid strenuous physical activity for one week after their second dose. ""it is important to note that heart attacks and strokes can occur naturally within our population, regardless of whether people are vaccinated or not,"" said hsa. ""due to the large numbers of people being vaccinated, it is expected that, by coincidence, some individuals may experience other medical events such as heart attacks and strokes in the days or weeks after vaccination which may not be related to the vaccination. ""hsa said it is monitoring the incidence of anaphylaxis and bell's palsy, which are adverse events historically reported with vaccines. there have been 45 reported cases of bell's palsy, which causes temporary weakness or paralysis of facial muscles.  most of the cases were not serious, hsa said, and patients will generally have completely recovery even without treatment. the incidence rate for this reaction in singapore is estimated to be 3. 35 per 100,000 persons per month.  hsa said that this is within the background incidence of 1. 1 to 4. 4 per 100,000 persons per month before the introduction of vaccination. the authority said that it, along with the ministry of health, will continue to monitor the safety of covid-19 vaccines closely and update the public on any significant safety concerns detected with the vaccines. overall, the benefits of the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines continue to outweigh the known risks of covid-19 disease and its severe complications in a pandemic, hsa added. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright Â© 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

in about one in seven cases.', 'these are typically resolved within a few days and are in line with the events described in the covid-19 vaccines product information, as well as those reported

2021-06-15,Small turnout as Jewel Changi Airport reopens after more than a month.,"singapore: around 10 customers were gathered outside the rich & good cake shop outlet at jewel changi airport a few minutes before it opened for business on monday (jun 14). it had been more than a month since the shop was shuttered, when jewel and the passenger terminals at changi airport were closed to the public in may to control a growing cluster of covid-19 cases. jewel was initially slated to reopen on may 27, but the closure wasextendedby the civil aviation authority of singapore (caas) and the changi airport group (cag) as an ""added precaution"". ""(the crowd) is actually slightly more than what we expected, we were expecting it to be totally empty because dine-in is still not allowed,"" said ms jerelyn foo, the company's media and operations manager. ""but it's definitely less compared to what we had before the closure,"" she added. at burger chain shake shack, which typically sees long queues during peak hours, food delivery riders as well as customers were spotted waiting in line for their food inside the restaurant. in contrast, luxury watch retailer sincere watch's outlet at jewel was largely empty, when cna visited the mall between 11. 30am to 3pm. ""i'm not surprised because it's just the first day of reopening and consumers just got to know about this so it will take time for them to gain confidence to come back to the mall and spend again,"" said mr kenneth tan, the company's senior operations manager. meanwhile, a small handful of moviegoers trickled in and out of shaw theatres jewel. ""it's a typical monday morning, so obviously it's quite quiet,"" said mr mark shaw, director of shaw organisation. ""we're just really happy to be open and we expect, hopefully, with some decent marketing from jewel and our team, as well as some of the bigger hollywood blockbusters coming online in the next couple of weeks, that business will pick up,"" he added. jewel extends rental support for tenantson monday, jewel announced that it would extend full rental waiver by an additional week until jun 20.  previously, it was only for the period of the mall's closure. between jun 21 and jun 27, jewel tenants will also receive rental ""assistance"", according to the mall.  it did not specify how much assistance would be provided. the additional support was welcomed by tenants cna spoke to, who said that it would take some time before shoppers returned. ""i expect that it will take a month or two to have the business back on track . . .  but we're quite positive about the sales going back to what we used to have, especially when the dine-in resumes,"" said ms cami soh, director of operations at shake shack singapore. enhanced safety measuresas of jun 13, 108 cases have been linked to changi airport, which remains the country's largest active cluster.  thelast three reported caseswere on may 23, which includes a seven-year-old singaporean boy who is a student at st stephen's school. last month, a 95-year-old woman linked to the clusterdied from complicationsdue to the coronavirus. to minimise the risk of transmission, jewel is now part of asegregated zoning systemimplemented by changi airport, which segregates 14,000 airport workers into three distinct zones based on risk level. jewel changi airport is under zone 3 the lowest risk group. this means that airport workers from zone 1, which has the highest risk of exposure, will not be allowed to enter jewel during their shifts. during the closure period, thorough cleaning and disinfection works were carried out.  more than 2,500 workers at jewel took the mandatory covid-19 test and none tested positive, according to jewel. it added that close to 90 per cent of eligible jewel staff have taken at least one dose of the vaccine so far. attracting visitorsto draw shoppers back, jewel is offering free parking until jul 11.  it is also working on new programmes and promotions, which will be shared at a later date. ""we are cognisant that it will take time to ramp up footfall at jewel, as singapore cautiously moves into phase 3 (heightened alert) with a gradual easing of restrictions,"" ms hung.

2021-06-15,"Englandâs bold choices pay off: Richard Buxton, Latest Football News.","england manager gareth southgate may have just altered the course of the three lions' euro 2020 history. no team have played in as many european championship games as england who are making their 10th finals appearance without ever reaching the final. until last night's 1-0 win over croatia in their group d opener, the class of 2021 appeared destined to become the latest chapter of a seemingly never-ending hard luck story of self-defeatism. but with a mix of bold choices and selection gambles, southgate might have changed that. raheem sterling's 57th-minute strike, pouncing onto a through-ball from influential leeds united midfielder kalvin phillips, breathed new life into a flagging three lions team who had resolutely attempted to take the game to their ageing visitors in the first half. the manchester city forward's inclusion in the starting line-up itself had already sparked consternation, with southgate lambasted before the game for choosing a player who had grown up in the shadow of wembley, ahead of jack grealish and jadon sancho. yet, the england manager's gamble paid off handsomely as he ended an unflattering sequence of nine winless opening group salvos in the continent's flagship tournament. he refused to bow to public pressure and persevered with a player whose track record of scoring for his country had produced a flawless return of 10 previous victories. southgate can also claim vindication for favouring protectionism over panache with kieran trippier's rare deployment at left-back raising eyebrows and questions alike. prior to staring down zlatko dalic's charges, he had played in the role on just four previous occasions, with the previous weekend's friendly win over austria the most recent. having the inside knowledge to nullify atletico madrid teammate sime vrsaljko, operating on the right side of defence, saw trippier chosen over the in-form duo of luke shaw and ben chilwell. hindsight suggests that southgate's boldness reaped a deserved reward as trippier rarely appeared troubled by croatia's three-pronged attack while right-back kyle walker recovered from a shaky first-half to shackle ivan perisic and josko gvardiol. for a time, this maiden group d encounter was in danger of following a similar pattern for england. as the clock ticked down towards the interval, phil foden's early effort that crashed against the base of dominik livakovic's right-hand post increasingly faded from memory with luka modric and mateo kovacic taking turns to wrest back control from their hosts. once temperatures soared at england's national stadium, however, the black-shirted croatians wilted.  they struggled to contain the omnipotent threat posed by sterling, phillips as well as second-half substitutes marcus rashford and jude bellingham. southgate's willingness to trust his instincts has further shifted the perception of the englishman, who has made the job his own these past 41â2 years. before last night, no england manager had the presence of mind to field a starting line-up devoid of liverpool or manchester united players at a major tournament, since the euro 1992 clash against against france. refusing to pander solely to representatives of the english premier league's traditional big six is an indication of southgate's willingness to place his hopes in the new brightest and best. that should mean more minutes for the likes of phillips, aston villa's tyrone mings the first villan to start for england at the euros since southgate himself played against germany in 1996 and west ham united midfielder declan rice. full-throated renditions of ""football's coming home"" at the final whistle may still be somewhat premature but england have never been in a stronger position to deliver. get the new paper on your phone with the free tnp app.  download from the apple app store or google play store

2021-06-15,The Guardian view on delaying lockdown easing: sadly unavoidable.,"the exponential spread of the delta variant, and the uncertainties surrounding it, mean pausing the roadmap is justifiedlast modified on mon 14 jun 2021 19. 35 edtsince february, when boris johnson unveiled a four-step roadmap to ending all covid restrictions in england, progress has been steady and at times relatively serene compared with the periods of abject confusion and chaos that went before.  the successful rollout of the vaccination programme allowed targets to be met, including the substantial ""step three"" easing of restrictions on 17 may. but as boris johnson recognised in his press conference today, the spread of the new delta variant â which now accounts for 96% of covid cases in the united kingdom â has upended calculations.  latest data suggests it is 40-80% more transmissible than the alpha variant, which originated in kent.  the variant partly evades vaccines and appears to increase the risk of hospitalisation.  hospital admission rates are increasing by 50% a week and 61% in the north-west.  a significant third wave is thus under way and the government's scientific advisers do not know the extent to which current rates of vaccination and acquired immunity will keep it in check.  a summer surge in hospitalisations could overwhelm an already overstretched nhs. the prime minister is therefore right to opt for caution by delaying the lifting of all covid restrictions until 19 july, reviewing the data in two weeks' time.  the roadmap has encountered a significant new hazard and, as mr johnson put it: ""now is the time to ease off the accelerator. "" given that significant unlocking has already taken place, it must be hoped this pause is enough to put the brakes on the new wave.  it will allow vital progress to be made in administering millions of second vaccine doses, which greatly increase protection against the delta variant.  it will also allow time to focus on reaching the 2 million or so over-50s who have still not been fully vaccinated, and to speed up second doses for the under-40s.  this will save lives.  by late july, schools will be breaking up for the summer, further reducing transmission risk.  even so, it seems likely that there will be another fraught review of data next month, in order to assess whether the link between infection and hospitalisation has been sufficiently broken to fully unlock. the delay is, of course, another bitter blow for the hospitality industry and the arts.  theatres, restaurants, pubs, concert venues and nightclubs, after haemorrhaging cash for more than a year, have spent money that they haven't got preparing for a full reopening next week.  many businesses are teetering on the edge of the abyss and some will now go under.  the level of the government's support should reflect the extent of the restrictions it continues to impose.  instead, the treasury is sticking to its plan to scale down the furlough scheme and business rate relief, ramping the financial pressure up still further.  this is shortsighted and unfair.  far more needs to be done to address the dire predicament of much-loved institutions, many of them independently owned and part of the fabric of their communities.  there was at least some limited good news for those who planned summer nuptials on the presumption that all restrictions would be lifted.  mr johnson announced the current cap on 30 guests will still be lifted for weddings and for funerals, though other restrictions and social distancing will remain in place.  the delta variant has cast a shadow over the summer.  but given the greater risks it has unleashed, and its virulence, mr johnson was right to heed the scientific advice and press the pause button for the time being.  as sir patrick vallance suggested today, the vaccination programme is now in a race with a faster-spreading variant.  the four-week delay is necessary to help it win that crucial contest.

""this morning, we have spoken to christian eriksen, who has sent his greetings to his team-mates.  his condition is stable, and he continues to be hospitalised for further examination,"" it tweeted. the 29-year-old player suffered a cardiac arrest, the team doctor confirmed, but the reason remained unclear. ""he was gone; we did cardiac resuscitation, it was a cardiac arrest.  we got him back after one defib (defibrillation),"" dr morten boesen told a news conference, adding that eriksen remained in hospital for further tests. ""the exams that have been done so far look fine.  we don't have an explanation to why it happened. ""the dbu also said that the team and staff had ""received crisis assistance and will continue to be there for each other after yesterday's incident"". the news will have come as relief to eriksen's current and former teammates, many of whom wished him well. the inter milan midfielder collapsed in the 43rd minute of denmark's euro 2020 opener, laying motionless on the pitch as medical personnel performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr). captain simon kjaer reportedly helped to clear eriksen's airways first and started cpr before medics took over.  goalkeeper kasper schmeichel was seen consoling eriksen's wife sabrina kvist.  both players earned widespread praise as heroes. the game was suspended temporarily but after receiving confirmation that eriksen was all right and in a stable condition and awake, uefa gave the danes an option to resume the game shortly or restart yesterday at noon local time. 1.  fabrice muambathe bolton man collapsed during an fa cup match in 2012 due to a cardiac arrest and was technically ""dead"" for 78 minutes before he was revived.  the former england under-21 midfielder had to retire soon after at the age of 24. 2.  antonio puertathe sevilla midfielder collapsed during a spanish la liga match in 2007 and again in the dressing room.  he was rushed to hospital, where he died three days later of multiple organ failure due to cardiac arrest at the age of 22. 3.  marc-vivien foethe cameroon midfielder, 28, died during a confederations cup match in 2003.  medical staff failed to restart his heart on the pitch and he was pronounced dead. reutersthe former tottenham star was said to have told his teammates to return to the field and denmark coach kasper hjulmand also insisted there was no pressure from uefa, but some felt the game should have been called off and rescheduled to a later date. manchester united great peter, the danish custodian's father, told the bbc: ""it's a ridiculous decision by uefa.  they should have tried to work out a different scenario and shown a little bit of compassion, and they didn't. ""when the game resumed, the atmosphere at parken stadium was considerably muted and the hosts appeared to be distracted, slipping to a 1-0 defeat courtesy of joel pohjanpalo's second-half winner. the header was one that kasper would normally have saved as it was straight at him, while kjaer had to be taken off in the 63rd minutes as the defender was too ""overwhelmed"" to continue. denmark's yussuf poulsen won a penalty when he went down under slight contact in the 73rd minute.  in the absence of usual spot-kick taker eriksen, pierre-emile hojbjerg assumed the responsibility but the midfielder could only hit his penalty straight at finland goalkeeper lukas hradecky and hjulmand later admitted that his players were ""traumatised"". in the aftermath of the shocking event, conspiracy theories sprung up on the internet, suggesting that eriksen had previously contracted covid-19 and had been vaccinated. but inter director giuseppe marotta dismissed those claims, saying there was no truth behind them, while eriksen's former cardiologist, dr sanjay sharma of st george's, university of london, added he had no heart issues during his seven-season spell at spurs. the dbu yesterday called off a scheduled press conference while the team's next training session was postponed indefinitely, local broadcaster tv2 reported. agence france-presse, reutersjoin st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright Â© 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-15,"157 suspected serious reactions to vaccines out of 3.7m doses here, Singapore News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. there have been 157 reports here of suspected reactions to the covid-19 vaccines severe enough to be life-threatening or result in hospitalisation, among other serious conditions. however, no deaths have been linked to the jab, the health sciences authority (hsa) said last friday. these ""suspected serious adverse events"" made up 0. 004 per cent of the almost 3. 7 million doses of pfizer-biontech and moderna jabs administered till may 23. these serious cases form part of the 4,704 ""suspected adverse event reports"" that hsa received till may 23.  these translate into 0. 13 per cent of administered doses, which is consistent with the percentage that had been reported by the authority on may 6, when it last gave an update on the safety record of both mrna vaccines. these reactions are suspected to be associated with the vaccinations, but may not have been caused by them. an adverse event or reaction related to vaccination is any undesirable medical condition that occurs after taking the vaccine, which does not necessarily have a direct link to the treatment.  they may be coincidental or related to an undiagnosed disease, but have to be reported by healthcare providers to hsa. reactions are considered serious if they result in hospitalisation, disability or life-threatening illnesses, among other things. anaphylaxis, which is the rapid onset of severe allergic reactions, was the most frequently reported serious adverse event, with 26 such cases.  all of them recovered after medical treatment, hsa said. it added that the incidence rate of anaphylaxis reported here with the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines is about 0. 85 cases for every 100,000 doses administered.  ""this is similar to the incidence rates reported overseas of around 0. 5 to two per 100,000 doses administered,"" said hsa. other severe allergic reactions numbered 23.  these include breathing difficulty, fast heart rate, an increase or decrease in blood pressure, chest discomfort and pain, fainting, limb numbness and weakness or pain, changes in vision, increase in liver enzymes, joint pain, fits, ringing in the ears and infections. the authority said most of those who had developed serious adverse events have recovered or are recovering.  ""these serious adverse events are being closely monitored by hsa,"" it added. hsa said that the most commonly reported reactions are consistent with those typically observed following vaccination. from the 4,704 reactions, the most common one was cases of rash, which accounted for more than one in four reported adverse events.  this was followed by cases of swelling of eyelids, face or lips, which occurred in about one in seven cases. these are typically resolved within a few days and are in line with the events described in the vaccines' product information, as well as those reported overseas. most of the adverse events were associated with the pfizer-biontech vaccine, which was rolled out for use here on dec 30 last year and comprised 83 per cent of the doses administered.  moderna was deployed on march 12 this year.  about 68 per cent of the total number of reactions reported were among people below the age of 60. hsa pointed out that trials of the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines found that those younger than 60 tend to experience more adverse effects occurring soon after vaccination, compared with those who are older. generally, younger people have more active immune responses and may experience more adverse effects, said hsa.  it pointed out that this is part of the body's natural response to build immunity against covid-19 infection. the authority added that 64 per cent of these reactions were reported in females. its update also noted that a greater frequency of heart attacks and strokes has not been observed in vaccinated persons locally. this comes after it was announced last friday that six people were reported to have suffered heart inflammation after receiving covid-19 vaccines four of whom were men aged below 30. as a precaution, experts have advised that vaccinated people, especially adolescents and younger men, should avoid strenuous physical activity for one week after their second dose. ""it is important to note that heart attacks and strokes can occur naturally within our population, regardless of whether people are vaccinated or not,"" said hsa. ""due to the large numbers of people being vaccinated, it is expected that, by coincidence, some individuals may experience other medical events such as heart attacks and strokes in the days or weeks after vaccination which may not be related to the vaccination. ""hsa said it is monitoring the incidence of anaphylaxis and bell's palsy, which are adverse events historically reported with vaccines. there have been 45 reported cases of bell's palsy, which causes temporary weakness or paralysis of facial muscles.  most of the cases were not serious, hsa said, and patients will generally have complete recovery even without treatment. the incidence rate for this reaction in singapore is estimated to be 3. 35 per 100,000 persons per month.  hsa said that this is within the background incidence of 1. 1 to 4. 4 per 100,000 persons per month before the introduction of vaccination. the authority said that it, along with the ministry of health, will continue to monitor the safety of covid-19 vaccines closely and update the public on any significant safety concerns detected with the vaccines. overall, the benefits of the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines continue to outweigh the known risks of covid-19 disease and its severe complications in a pandemic, hsa added. join st's telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you. sph digital news / copyright Â© 2021 singapore press holdings ltd.  co.  regn.  no.  198402868e.  all rights reservedwe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.  until we resolve the issues, subscribers need not log in to access st digital articles.  but a log-in is still required for our pdfs.

2021-06-15,Men who helped Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn flee Japan admit their role.,"michael and peter taylor tell tokyo court of their part in spiriting away executive in musical instrument caselast modified on mon 14 jun 2021 17. 40 edttwo americans charged with helping former nissan chair carlos ghosn flee japan while he was facing accusations of financial misconduct have told a court that they took part in a scheme for him to escape the country. statements by michael taylor and his son, peter, on the opening day of their trial in tokyo suggested the pair don't plan to fight charges of assisting a criminal, which carry a possible penalty of up to three years in prison. keiji isaji, one of the attorneys for the taylors, told the associated press after the court session that he wants the trial to ""proceed efficiently"".  he said ending the trial quickly is ""in the best interests of his clients"". he declined to confirm his team was hoping for a suspended sentence if they are convicted, meaning no time would be served.  he stressed the decision was up to the judge. the taylors appeared calm as they were led into the courtroom in handcuffs, with ropes tied around their waists. they said little except to answer the judge's questions when asked about simultaneous interpreting relayed through headphones. prosecutors read out a statement accusing michael taylor, a former green beret, and peter taylor of arranging to hide ghosn in a musical equipment case.  it was loaded on to a private jet that flew him from the western city of osaka to lebanon via turkey in december 2019. ryozo kitajima, one of the prosecutors, said peter taylor met ghosn at a hotel several times in 2019 and introduced ghosn to his father.  he said peter taylor received $562,500 in two transfers to pay for chartering the jet and other expenses. peter taylor arranged for ghosn to change his clothing at a tokyo hotel.  his father and another man, george-antoine zayek, later accompanied ghosn to the osaka airport, kitajima said.  zayek has not been arrested. the prosecutors said bitcoins worth $500,000 were transferred from ghosn's son anthony's account to peter taylor in 2020, purportedly to cover the taylors' defence costs. prosecutors said that during their detention the taylors had expressed remorse and that the pair had been misled to believe helping someone to jump bail was not illegal in japan. they said ghosn's wife, carole, told them ghosn was being tortured.  the prosecutors quoted the taylors as saying they were not tortured and were treated in a way that was ""fair and professional"". the trial's next session is set for 29 june, when prosecutors will continue their questioning. the taylors were arrested in massachusetts last year and extradited to japan in march.  ghosn has french, lebanese and brazilian citizenship and lebanon has no extradition treaty with japan.  the authorities say ghosn paid the taylors at least $1. 3m (Â£920,000). ghosn led nissan motor co for two decades before his arrest in 2018.  he was charged with falsifying securities reports in under-reporting his compensation and of breach of trust in using nissan money for personal gain.  he says he is innocent and says he fled japan because he did not expect to get a fair trial.  more than 99% of criminal cases in japan result in convictions. no japanese executives have been charged in the scandal at nissan, the yokohama-based manufacturer of the leaf electric car, march subcompact and infiniti luxury models.  extraditions between japan and the us are relatively rare, even for serious crimes. the possible penalty of three years in prison is the minimum required for an extradition. before his arrest, ghosn was an motor industry star, having orchestrated nissan's rebound from the brink of bankruptcy after he was sent to japan by its french alliance partner renault in 1999. ghosn's pay was halved, by about 1 billion yen ($10 million), in 2010 when japan began requiring disclosure of high executive pay. the concern was that his relatively high compensation might be viewed unfavourably since japanese top executives tend to draw lower pay packages than their peers in other countries.

            F365 Says: Dominant Spain suffer from familiar flaw        .","home  f365 says  f365 says: dominant spain suffer from familiar flawdate published: monday 14th june 2021 10:54                 ian watson spain's lack of potency is nothing new but luis enrique must find a fresh and swift solution. . .  luis enrique is unlikely to panic after seeing his spain side fail to make their dominance pay against sweden.  with one win from their last six major tournament openers, la roja are used to starting slowly. another familiar failing, though, will keep enrique awake tonight after this stalemate in seville.  spain's positive approach play, once again, was wasted by their forward line. never did spain look more like a team of midfielders.  with 75 per cent possession, the hosts passed and passed, 953 times to be precise â 231 more passes than any other team in the group stage so far â but with sweden content to sit back and watch the merry-go-round, enrique's men struggled to proportionately test robin olsen. that is not to say spain did not create chances.  rather, the ones they did were hopelessly wasted.  and the hosts did not muster enough opportunities to be so profligate. this was always the fear for spain.  despite their previous pedigree and the obvious talent within enrique's ranks, the lack of potency in attack has kept them off many people's list of genuine contenders to win the tournament. 17 â spain had 17 shots in tonight's draw against sweden, their highest tally in a major tournament game (european championships + world cup) without scoring since having 25 attempts against switzerland in a group stage match at the 2010 world cup.  stalemate.  #euro2020 #esp #swe pic. twitter. com/bbvt0vopunâ optajoe (@optajoe) june 14, 2021the absence of firepower and concerns over the heart of their defence were seen the primary flaws in enrique's plan, but the forward line must be a far greater concern for enrique than the raw partnership between pau torres and aymeric laporte. alvaro morata, handsome-yet-hapless, is the obvious poster boy for spain's striking woes.  the atletico madrid striker, who spent the season on loan at juventus, was trusted by enrique to lead the line but morata proved his many doubters right once more. he wasted spain's biggest chance, one that arrived courtesy of sweden's only defensive slip of the night.  the otherwise-excellent marcus danielson missed jordi alba's hopeful pass to allow morata a clear shot but with time and space to pick his spot, the striker inexplicably rolled the ball wide of the target. morata's subsequent subdued slump towards enrique's hook was inevitable to anyone who saw the forward endure a miserable season and a half at chelsea.  no club among chelsea, real madrid, atletico, juventus has yet trusted morata to lead their line for more than two consecutive seasons before deciding to source their goals elsewhere. for enrique, consecutive games at euro 2020 would be too many.  morata is certainly not the only striker for whom confidence is key, but few are as extreme as the 28-year-old.  morata has failed to score in his last four spain appearances and he has only two goals in eight appearances since earning another shot in enrique's squad at the back end of last year. gerard moreno is the most obvious replacement, but ferran torres was moved inside for a brief attempt at leading the line after morata was withdrawn on 66 minutes.  torres lasted only eight minutes more before being replaced by moreno.  and the villarreal striker was guilty too of wasting a glorious late chance when he directed a close-range header straight at olsen. when enrique assesses his options for the crucial clash with poland on saturday night, moreno offers the most in-form alternative to morata.  his 30 goals in 46 games in all competitions for villarreal make a most compelling case. enrique could be forgiven for looking enviously at sweden's biggest threat, aleksander isak.  the real sociedad striker was constant threat to spain.  the 21-year-old's power and technique created sweden's two best opportunities, with spain lucky to avoid being on the end of a swedish smash and grab. there were some positives for enrique.  chief among them, pedri.  the barcelona youngster became spain's youngest-ever player at the european championships and his influence grew as the game wore on.  which it certainly did for many neutral observers. even pedri, though, was perhaps not as direct as he had been for barca last season and a lack of leaders around the 18-year-old is another concern for enrique, especially while sergio busquets sits out. the greatest worry, though, remains spain's inability to profit from their possession.

2021-06-15,"E-scooter and e-bike riders must pass theory test by end of this year: LTA, Transport News & Top Stories.","read 3 articles daily and stand to win st rewards, including the st news tablet worth $398. spin the wheel for st read and win now. singapore users of power-assisted bicycles (pabs) and e-scooters will have to pass a mandatory online theory test by the end of this year, in order to continue using them in public spaces. pab users will have 40 minutes to tackle 40 multiple-choice questions. e-scooter riders will have to answer 30 multiple-choice questions in 30 minutes. the passing score for both tests which will improve awareness of active mobility rules, code of conduct and safe riding practices is 80 per cent. the land transport authority (lta), which announced details of the test on monday (june 14), said those who pass will receive a digital certificate with no expiry date. it added that it is giving riders time to prepare for the test which will be rolled out on july 1 before enforcement kicks in on jan 1. ""from jan 1, 2022, riders will be required to show their digital certificate when requested by enforcement officers,"" said lta. ""we encourage riders to register and obtain the test certificates as soon as possible, once the test is made available on june 30. ""those caught riding without the certificate can be fined up to $2,000 and/or jailed for six months for the first offence. repeat offenders can be fined up to $5,000 and/or jailed for 12 months. the active mobility advisory panel (amap) first proposed a mandatory test for e-scooter and pab users in september 2019, among other recommendations.  these came after a spate of accidents involving mobility devices and the death of a cyclist after a collision with a speeding e-scooter rider whose device did not meet regulations. the government accepted the recommendations and said it would complement other efforts to boost path and road safety. riders can register for the test from june 30 with the singapore polytechnic's professional and adult continuing education academy.  those who do so between june 30 and sept 30 will pay a discounted rate of $5 per test, with a free resit should they fail on their first try. those who register after sept 30 will pay $10 per test attempt. lta said the test will be available in english, chinese, malay and tamil.  riders can prepare through e-handbooks that it has uploaded online. those who want to take the test in person should contact lta at this website and the request will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. lta said riders will need to register an account on the theory test portal using their singpass at least one day before the test. those taking the test have to be at least 16, the minimum age for riding pabs and e-scooters. adults supervising e-scooter riders below 16 will also be required to pass the e-scooter theory test. mr denis koh, chairman of personal mobility device enthusiast group bwss, said the six-month timeline to take the test is an achievable one for riders. mr koh, a former amap member, said he had tried a trial version of the test without referring to the handbooks provided by lta.  for the e-scooter test, he was able to meet the 80 per cent passing mark, but he fell short for the pab test. he said there is no need for riders to panic about the tests, and encouraged them to prepare by reading lta's handbooks and signing up for available training programmes. ""at the end of the day, it's about making sure candidates know the rules and good practices well enough to be safe on paths and roads,"" he added.  
""hopefully, the test will ensure that people have the minimum required knowledge to ride safely.

""singapore is a multiracial nation.  we truly believe in the ideals expressed in the national pledge and cherish the hard-won racial harmony, but that does not mean that we believe that there are no tensions in racial relationships,"" it said. ""lianhe zaobao has always taken a consistent stance on upholding equality among all races and advocating that there should be mutual understanding among ethnic groups.  this is evident from our editorials, news reports and feature articles.  in the midst of the pandemic, we have seen more racial tensions simmering, which is why we have published a total of seven editorials related to this issue in the past year and a half. ""the open letter, which was signed by over 200 people, was concerned about the way it felt zaobao had characterised the problem of racism here in the wake of recent racial incidents in its june 9 editorial titled 'expanding public space to promote racial harmony'. the letter's signatories include phd students, researchers and academics, among them professors linda lim, lee soo ann, vineeta sinha and pang eng fong. the letter said the editorial ""ignores the dynamics of structural racism and the longer history of racial stereotyping in singapore"", and blamed the recent incidents on the uncertainty caused by the pandemic, the sensationalism of social media, and the import of ""foreign ideas"" such as critical race theory the idea that racism is not just about personal prejudice but is also embedded and perpetuated by systems and policies. ""it is true that feelings of uncertainty heighten inter-group tensions, and that conversations on social media can be polarising.  however, the editorial uses these arguments to suggest that recent racist incidents are an anomaly in an otherwise racially harmonious society, and that social media exaggerates what are otherwise exceptional acts by unusually racist individuals,"" said the letter. it said the pandemic and social media have ""simply revealed long-standing fissures and the everyday discrimination experienced by racial minorities in singapore"". the letter also said zaobao had misrepresented critical race theory as ""promoting hatred of white people"" in the united states, and by extension, of chinese people here.  it added that this argument is typically made by far-right commentators in the us who do not engage in the actual writings and concepts of critical race theory. in response, zaobao hoped readers would see the june 9 editorial in its entirety, saying the piece analyses the problem from three different aspects, and tries to explain that the pandemic, the role of social media, and popular ideological trends from abroad have all exacerbated racial tensions. critical race theory (crt) was cited as an example of the influence of foreign ideas, zaobao said, adding some scholars had used the concept, which originated in the us in the 1970s, to analyse race issues here, and criticise it for downplaying the ""systemic and structural racism"" in singapore. it also noted the different interpretations of the concept in academic circles, saying: ""one should not easily dismiss the critique of crt by serious scholars as a 'far-right american perspective'. """"we strongly believe that when discussing the issue of race in singapore, we should not be applying foreign ideas and concepts without adapting them to local conditions,"" zaobao added. it said racial discrimination exists in every society, with some things in common and others specific to each.  ""theories and concepts based on foreign situations may not always be applicable to singapore.  sometimes, instead of deepening our understanding of the issue and promoting consensus, they may complicate it.  but we are also aware and accept that there are those who do not agree with such views and positions.

2021-06-15,Not possible to have fair hearing: Woman without mask at MBS.,"singapore â an ex-naval officer charged for not wearing a mask in numerous places returned to court again on tuesday (15 june) claiming that it was not possible for her to have a fair hearing due to previous cases involving the singapore armed forces (saf). phoon chiu yoke, who faces seven charges of not wearing her mask in various places and breaching her stay-home notice, again asked district judge (dj) janet wang for her charges to be dropped.  the 53-year-old singaporean was filmed in a confrontation with a safe-distancing ambassador (sda) at marina bay sands last month.  the incident on 15 may was caught in a viral video showing phoon demanding to see the sda's badge.  phoon also removed her mask after leaving court on 24 may, when she was photographed and filmed by the media. at her tuesday hearing, the prosecution told the court that phoon may face additional charges, including those from the immigration and checkpoints authority.  phoon, who represented herself, stated that she was an ex-naval officer who had a ""number of incidents"" when she was a ""plaintiff"" or ""eyewitness"" to many cases, and as such, it was ""not possible"" for her to have a fair hearing.

2021-06-15,Opinion.,"in established democracies, the tradition is for a defeated leader to act graciously toward the victor â to make a show of national unity despite the rage and humiliation that might be burning inside.  former president donald trump flushed that tradition down a gold-plated toilet, along with many other democratic norms.  he not only refused to show up at president biden's inaugural but continues to this day to accuse biden of being an illegitimate president who was fraudulently elected. you would think other democratic leaders would recoil from trump's odious example.  not former israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu.  in leaving office, bibi, as he is known, is showing himself to be as graceless and selfish as the master of mar-a-lago.  like trump, he refused to attend the inauguration of his successor â the new right-wing prime minister, naftali bennett, who leads a coalition government with the centrist yair lapid. shortly before the vote in the knesset that confirmed his downfall, netanyahu delivered an angry, vituperative, scorched-earth speech full of trumpian invective.  it truly has to be read for its awfulness and pettiness to be believed. netanyahu began with lots of self-praise before segueing into attacks on the ""dangerous"" new government.  although bennett is also a critic of the nuclear deal with iran, bibi claimed that his former protege won't stand up to the biden administration like he would.  he even attacked president franklin d.  roosevelt for not bombing german concentration camps and the railways leading to them in 1944.  this was by way of suggesting that the united states is again doing nothing to save the jewish people from ""extermination,"" while bibi alone protects the jews.  he claimed that bennett ""doesn't have the international standing"" to oppose a nuclear agreement â and won't do what netanyahu did when he spoke to congress in 2015 against the nuclear deal. this is several orders of crazy historical revisionism.  first, historians doubt that u. s.  bombing could have stopped or even significantly slowed the holocaust.  second, netanyahu's speech to congress did not stop the nuclear accord â it only alienated then-president barack obama and other democrats, while aligning netanyahu with the republicans.  that partisanship has done long-term damage to the u. s. -israel alliance. third, and most importantly, the iranian threat against israel has actually grown since trump, at netanyahu's urging, pulled out of the nuclear accord in 2018.  since then, iran has ramped up its nuclear program, while stepping up the production of missiles and drones and its support for regional allies such as hamas and hezbollah.  yet netanyahu claimed that iran is ""celebrating"" his downfall. as if it weren't enough to accuse the new government of endangering israel's security, netanyahu also argued that it will endanger israel's economy.  ""try to ruin our wonderful economy as little as possible,"" he said, ""so that we can fix it as quickly as possible when we return to power. ""bibi then delivered his own version of trump's phony claims about a ""rigged"" election.  ""the vote counting was kosher,"" netanyahu admitted, ""but the winning of the votes was done fraudulently.  bennett led astray hundreds of thousands of right-wing voters and transferred their votes from the right to the left. "" as if israeli voters did not realize that in casting ballots for the parties led by bennett and his allies, they were voting to remove netanyahu from office.  because the new coalition government is backed by an israeli-arab party, bibi accused it of being the handmaiden of ""extreme islam. ""bibi's final blast was very trumpian in its self-pity.  ""my family and i have been through hunting, prosecution and denigration, the likes of which has never been seen,"" he said.  ""all so that i will bow down and surrender to the left. "" just as trump claims to be fighting for ""forgotten americans,"" so bibi insisted, ""i did not surrender because i am operating in the name of a large public of millions of citizens, as the servant of a millennia old ancient people, wishing to sit in peace and security in its own land. ""what nonsense.  netanyahu is facing corruption charges in an israeli court.  the reason he did not ""surrender"" â the reason he put the country through four elections in less than two years â has nothing to do with the interests of ""millions of citizens"" and everything to do with his self-interest.  he has been desperately clinging to power in the hopes of getting the knesset to pass a law that would render a prime minister immune to prosecution. netanyahu has genuine accomplishments to boast of â from israel's covid-19 vaccination campaign to winning recognition of israel from four muslim states.  he is much smarter than trump and much more skilled at politics.  but his farewell speech shows why so many of his former allies turned against him and ultimately turfed him out of office.  like trump, netanyahu suffers from a crippling character defect.  he lies, schemes and backstabs because politics, for him, is ultimately about self-promotion â not national service.  his farewell address showed why he should never be given another chance to lead. read more:jennifer rubin: like the u. s. , israel bids goodbye to an unhinged leaderyousef munayyer: why a new israeli

""i'm speechless guys, it's the second time.  both the same, when i'm sleeping with no one else home,"" zul said. zul doesn't only have one or two cats, he's got a clowder of russian blue. somehow, his cat (or cats) figured out how the kitchen tap worked and waited for the perfect time to strike â when the human wasn't awake. the worst part for zul was that he was just about to head to work but had to take urgent leave to clear up the mess instead. that didn't seem to bother his cats one tiny bit.  many were in a state of pure serendipity, splashing about in the water with not a care for the world. ""don't play! look, they're playing in the water. the one that's gotta clean this mess is me, luckily my parents aren't home,"" zul quipped. towards the end of the video, some cats were just chilling on the furniture, seemingly avoiding the water now that they've had their fair share of fun. zul was still trying to come to terms with what his cats had put him through. ""it's like a swimming pool, y'all go and swim!,"" zul said in annoyance as he threw a tennis ball towards his cats. this time no more water ð¤£ ##russianbluethe following day, zul posted another video of his cats running amok at home.  this time, it wasn't to do with kitchen taps but kitchen towels instead. bits of kitchen towels were scattered everywhere, from the space surrounding a room door to the entire kitchen area and kitchen toilet. ""i came out of the room and was shocked.  look at what they're doing.  they're playing with tissue! they're playing with tissue!"" zul asserted in the same exasperated tone from the previous post. a netizen tried to get zul to look on the brighter side by stating that at least it's an easier clean-up on zul's part, as compared to when his cats were playing with water.  another netizen felt like the cats were just too cute and adorable.  zul admitted that he too saw the funny side and found it difficult to get mad at them. when you can say that, even after two flooding incidents and bits of

2021-06-15,"PA cancels meeting with couple whose photo was used as standee, denies incident was racist.","singapore: the people's association (pa) has cancelled a meeting with a couple whose wedding photo was used as a cut-out standee without their permission, saying that there was ""no point"" in proceeding with it after comments she made on social media. the meeting with ms sarah bagharib and her husband razif abdullah was set up to offer them an in-person apology over the incident, said the pa in a facebook post on monday (jun 14).  a photo from their wedding in 2017 was recently used as part of hari raya decorations at a tiong bahru estate in radin mas constituency. ""we also wished to clarify our position, elaborate on the steps we have taken to prevent such incidents from recurring, and hear her suggestions of how we might improve at the meeting,"" said the pa in its statement on facebook. however, the pa said that ms sarah had made a public call in her social media posts to ""please share your messages/suggestions to pa here and we'll share them"". ""we find this odd.  we do not see why our meeting should be appropriated as a platform for her to funnel the views and comments of persons unrelated to the incident,"" the pa said. ""all these lead us to believe her purpose in agreeing to meet with us has gone far beyond the radin mas incident.  we therefore see no point in proceeding with the meeting. ""allegations of racismthe pa had publicly apologised to the couple on may 29 and removed the standee.  it also said: ""we will take steps to guide and help our staff and, as far as possible, external vendors as well, to be more culturally-attuned and sensitive. ""ms sarah posted a response to pa's apology on jun 1, saying that there are ""glaring gaps that indicate a very superficial understanding of the gravity of the issue"".  this was not just about copyright infringement, but there was a ""larger issue affecting the wider malay/muslim community"", she said. ""it is unfortunate that a government body that was established to build and bridge communities in achieving one people, one singapore is required to still 'guide and help (its) staff . . .  to be more culturally-attuned and sensitive' 61 years after inception,"" she wrote in the post. ms sarah also referenced the incident in a few instagram stories, which the pa responded to in its statement on monday. referring to an instagram story re-posted by ms sarah on jun 11, the pa said ms sarah had shared claims by another user that the incident perpetuates ""racist culture"". the pa also said that ms sarah characterised the standee incident as ""racist"" by lumping it with ""other racist attacks and incidents"" in one of her posts, and that she ""insinuated"" in an interview with assistant professor walid jumblatt abdullah that the pa's staff and volunteers did not find anything wrong with the standee as they might be ""blind to racism"". the assistant professor is from nanyang technological university's school of social sciences, with research areas that include religion and politics. during the interview on jun 7, ms sarah noted that the hari raya light-up event featuring the standee was attended by mp melvin yong.  she wondered if mr yong saw the standee and what he thought about it, saying: ""if he did and he didn't say anything about it, then something is definitely wrong. """"there was a comment there as well about internalised racism,"" she added.  ""we've been so conditioned to think that this is a certain way . . .  there's nothing wrong with this because you know people that are colourblind, i guess, or blind to racism at play or there's nothing wrong because it doesn't impact them. ""pa rejects accusationson monday, the pa said it rejects those accusations. ""while the error was culturally insensitive, it was certainly not racist.  it is not right to raise the allegation of racism, without basis, to stoke emotions and sentiments,"" it added. cna has contacted ms sarah for her reaction to the pa's comments. the pa also said that its grassroots organisations such as the malay activity executive committees council (mesra) and the indian activity executive committees council (narpani pearavai) play a key role in representing the interests of the malay and indian communities. ""we regularly reach out to numerous community partners among all our races and religions to ensure that their concerns are actively considered when designing our programmes,"" it added. what happened with the standee at radin mas was an ""isolated incident"", said the pa, adding that it showed nonetheless that the organisation ""can fall short"". ""we agree it is important for our staff and volunteers to be sensitive to and knowledgeable about the cultures of all our ethnic groups.   we are now looking at establishing a resource panel to guide and advise our staff on cultural matters. ""we will also step up training efforts to enhance staff and volunteers' understanding and appreciation of our different cultures.  singaporeans becoming 'one people' is a work in progress â and so is the pa. ""it further refuted ms sarah's point that it was ""hasty in sharing the name of the vendor"" in order to ""distance and deflect blame"". ""this is untrue,"" said the pa on monday.  ""the vendor had identified himself directly to ms sarah on may 28 and apologised.  this was before pa issued our statement on may 29. ""it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

                    monday, 14 jun 2021
                singapore (the straits times/ann): a man posed as a woman online to lure a 17-year-old boy into having commercial sex with him. muhammad al-masfuiin muhsin, now 26, had pretended to be a woman who was looking for a ""sex slave"" to provide sexual services for ""herself"" and her ""boyfriend"" in exchange for s$250. on june 18, 2019, the teenager, who had been kicked out of his home earlier, arrived at a tampines flat.  al-masfuiin, posing as the boyfriend, then performed a sexual act on the boy in exchange for a night's lodging in the unit.  he also gave the boy a $50 note. the singaporean, who was aware of the teenager's age, was sentenced on monday (june 14) to 10 months' jail after admitting that he had indulged in commercial sex with a minor below 18 years old. the victim cannot be named due to a gag order to protect his identity. deputy public prosecutor emily koh said that some time in 2017, the boy started using online classifieds website locanto and discovered advertisements for sexual services as well as posts by people looking for ""sugar mummies"" or ""friends with benefits"". a sugar mummy commonly refers to an older woman who is willing to pay for the company of a younger person. he created an account on locanto as he wanted to earn money by offering sexual services. the teenager was kicked out of his home on june 16, 2019, after a heated argument with his mother. in need of money, he created an advertisement on locanto titled ""toyboy fantasy"", stating he was looking for a ""sugar mummy"" and was willing to provide sexual services. al-masfuiin, who came across the advertisement, posed as a woman and chatted with the boy via messaging platform telegram. the dpp said: ""the accused was aware that the victim had no place to stay and offered lodging to the victim.  still posing as a female, the accused told the victim that he could stay at 'her boyfriend's place' and that 'he'll send a grab to let you stay over'. ""believing that the accused was a female, the victim asked if the accused was joining the sex session.  the accused, still posing as a female, replied that 'she' 'might not', 'but my (boyfriend) will tell me if you did a great job at sex'. ""the teenager arrived at the tampines flat at around 1. 20am on june 18 and al-masfuiin performed oral sex on him. the boy later fell asleep in the unit and al-masfuiin gave him the $50 note after he woke up that morning.  the pair then parted ways. a police officer was patrolling in toa payoh later that day when he spotted the teenager. he looked through the youngster's mobile phone and found out the minor had been providing sexual services.  al-masfuiin was arrested soon after. for having commercial sex with a minor below 18 years old, an offender can be jailed for up to seven years and fined.  the straits times/asia news network

2021-06-15,A humpback whale swallowed Michael PackÃ rd as was lobster diving in Cape Cod.,"josiah mayo surveyed the ocean's surface on friday, watching the bubbles that emerged from his fishing partner's underwater breathing gear.  it was michael packard's second plunge into the ocean off the coast of cape cod that morning and he had already caught about 100 pounds of lobster. but the bubbles suddenly stopped.  then, an explosion of white water erupted from the sea. mayo wasn't sure what he was witnessing.  a burly fish thrashed before him and for a split second he thought it was a great white shark.  then mayo saw its flukes cut through the water and observed it violently shake its head. ""this was a humpback whale,"" mayo, 43, told himself, as he recounted in an interview with the washington post.  ""it was a relief because it wasn't a shark, which meant michael would be all done at that point. ""moments later there was another mighty boil of white water and packard soared out of the ocean and flopped back down.  mayo sped the boat up next to packard, who was floating in a puffed-out drysuit thanks to the whale's speedy ascent to the surface. ""i was inside it.  i was inside its mouth,"" packard, 56, told mayo.  ""it tried to eat me. ""packard's harrowing tale is rare and unheard of among the experienced divers of provincetown, mass.  humpback whales don't harm people on purpose, said mayo, who worked on whale-watching boats as a teenager and whose father is a premier whale scientist. mayo said his father and his colleagues believe the only logical explanation was that the whale swallowed packard by accident. ""it took [packard] from behind and it seemed like it fully enveloped him immediately,"" mayo said.  ""that's kind of remarkable and so we can only imagine the whale was probably feeding. ""mayo added he believed it was a young whale. ""i like to think of it as a teenager or a puppy.  . . .  it probably doesn't know what it's doing too well,"" he said. a similar incident occurred off the coast of port elizabeth, south africa, in 2019 when a bryde's whale scooped up a marine conservationist documenting a mass migration.  experts who witnessed the event also said it was an accident, noting the whales are ""gentle giants,"" one said in a short documentary. diving is a dangerous occupation and packard, a provincetown native who has been commercial diving since he was 18, has come close to death more times than most, mayo said. while lobster diving in 2017, packard came across the body of a fellow diver who was lost at sea six years earlier.  packard has gotten lost a few times himself, mayo said, thanks to a strong current that carried him far from the boat.  mayo, fortunately, found him each time. packard spent years diving for abalone in the shark-filled waters off the coast of central california, mayo said.  he's gotten concussions, injured his hand a few times and had two close encounters with great white sharks in cape cod. ""clearly they weren't interested in eating him because they would have, since they could have,"" mayo said. packard also nearly died in 2001 when he was in a plane crash in costa rica and suffered life-threatening injuries.  three people died and at least four others survived. on friday around 5:30 a. m. , mayo and packard set off into calm water in their fishing vessel, named the ""ja'n j"" after packard's 12- and 16-year-old sons.  the two have worked together for about 15 years and often fish for lobster, bluefin tuna and mackerel. packard's first dive that morning ""wasn't great,"" mayo said, requiring his partner to go back in a few more times. at about 8 a. m. , packard plunged about 45 feet deep, and almost reached the ocean floor when he ""felt this truck hit me and everything just went dark,"" he said in an interview with wbts. ""and i could feel just . . .  hard stuff all around me,"" packard said.  ""and i just thought, 'did i just get eaten by a white shark?' and then i said, 'no, i don't feel any teeth. ' and i said, 'oh my god, i'm in the mouth of a whale.  with his mouth shut. ' ""packard felt the whale swimming and shoved his breathing regulator back into his mouth. ""i'm like, 'this is how you're gonna go, michael.  this is how you're going to die.  in the mouth of a whale,' "" he recalled thinking. for about 30 to 40 seconds, packard twisted, turned and coped with an agonizing pressure on his legs.  he could feel the whale's forceful head shakes. then came the light. ""i just got thrown out of his mouth, into the water â there was white water everywhere,"" he said.  ""and i just was lying on the surface floating and saw his tail and he went back down.  and i was like, 'oh my god, i got out of that.  i survived. '""with the help of a friend who was fishing nearby and witnessed the incident, mayo gently pulled packard out of the water and removed his drysuit.  packard was calm and fully cognizant, mayo said, and told the men he thought his legs were broken.  they also worried that packard had an embolism because the whale drove him up to the surface so quickly, a ""no-no in diving,"" mayo said. mayo then called the ambulance, rescue squad and packard's wife and drove full-speed toward the dock. hospital staff were in awe of packard's story, he said in an ""ask me anything"" on reddit on sunday. ""i said 'i got stuck in a whale's mouth,'"" packard's son wrote on behalf of his father.  ""all the nurses and doctors at the hospital came to see me and ask me about it.  one nurse came in with a notepad, she asked me for lottery numbers!""after tests, doctors told packard he had no broken bones and there were no signs of an embolism.  his legs were badly bruised, and he had a dislocated knee.  doctors sent him home later that day. packard's story quickly spread throughout the town and eventually made national and international headlines.  though packard's experience appears fantastical, his reputation among locals as an experienced angler made his account all the more believable, mayo said. ""if it was some yahoo, i think we'd be arguing if it actually happened,"" mayo said.  ""you see him narrating what happened and it's just . . .  so very clearly true and obvious what happened. ""packard's bruised legs have forced him to stay grounded as they heal, but he's already planning his next trip out into the ocean.

2021-06-15,"People's Association withdraws offer to meet couple over wedding photo incident, says allegations of racism 'not right', Singapore News.","singapore the people's association (pa) has withdrawn its offer to meet a malay/muslim couple whose photo was used as a standee for hari raya aidilfitri decorations without permission, citing disagreements with them over the purpose of the meeting and how they had characterised the incident. communications specialist sarah bagharib, 30, had posted on social media on may 28 about the inappropriate use of her wedding photograph at a housing board estate in radin mas constituency. this drew a public apology from the pa and an offer from the government agency to meet her and her husband, mr razif abdullah, to apologise in person for the distress caused by its mistakes. however, in a facebook post on monday (june 14), the pa, which oversees various grassroots groups, said it saw no point in going ahead with the meeting, citing ms sarah's recent comments on the matter. the pa said ms sarah had shared claims that the incident ""perpetuate(s) the racist culture"" and was ""racist"". the agency rejected these claims, saying: ""while the error was culturally insensitive, it was certainly not racist.  it is not right to raise the allegation of racism, without basis, to stoke emotions and sentiments. ""[[nid:530926]]it also noted that she had made a public call for messages and suggestions ahead of the meeting. ""we find this odd.  we do not see why our meeting should be appropriated as a platform for her to funnel the views and comments of persons unrelated to the incident,"" the pa added. ""all these lead us to believe her purpose in agreeing to meet us has gone far beyond the radin mas incident.  we therefore see no point in proceeding with the meeting. ""the couple's wedding photo had been used by a vendor to create a standee alongside a decorative platform and banner depicting radin mas mp melvin yong and his hari raya aidilfitri greetings to residents. the pa had explained in an earlier statement that its radin mas constituency office had engaged a vendor, warabi enterprise (art studio), to design and put up hari raya aidilfitri decorations at the tiong bahru orchid estate. the vendor came up with the concept and design, and downloaded and used the photo from an online source for the standee. after ms sarah drew attention to the matter, the pa removed the standee, and offered to meet the couple. on monday, the pa said it had wanted to clarify its position, elaborate on the steps it had taken to prevent such incidents from recurring, and hear her suggestions of how it might improve at the meeting. it also said it had, over e-mail, explained to ms sarah that it values racial and religious harmony in singapore. the pa also made references to two instagram stories ms sarah had posted recently in explaining its response.   in the first, she reshared an instagram story by another instagram user, @jeanpsychologist, who had responded to an instagram post ms sarah had made. user @jeanpsychologist thanked ms sarah for posting on the incident, and called for chinese singaporeans to ""educate ourselves on our conditioned racism"", saying this is ""long overdue towards our friends in minority communities who have to put up with our ignorance which continues to perpetuate the racist culture that hurts them"". in the second instagram story, ms sarah penned a series of reflections on the incident, and said she was thankful to those who had stood in solidarity with her and her husband as well as other ethnic minorities in the aftermath of ""this incident (and other racist attacks and incidents that have been filmed)"". the pa also claimed ms sarah had insinuated in an online talk show on june 7 that pa's staff and volunteers did not find anything wrong with the standee as they might be ""blind to racism"". she had been asked by host walid jumblatt abdullah, an assistant professor from nanyang technological university, whether she would accept an invitation from mr yong to meet in person if he had made such an offer. ms sarah replied she would, wondered if the mp had seen the standee, and added that ""something is definitely wrong"" if he had seen the standee and did not say anything about it. she also referred to someone's comment about internalised racism, and spoke about how some people are blind to racism, or feel there is nothing wrong with racism as it does not impact them. in its post, the pa stressed it remains steadfast in its mission to promote racial harmony, and that its grassroots organisations, such as the malay activity executive committees council and narpani pearavai, play a key role in representing the interests of the malay and indian communities. ""we regularly reach out to numerous community partners among all our races and religions to ensure their concerns are actively considered when designing our programmes,"" it added. the pa also said that what happened at radin mas was an isolated incident, but nevertheless shows that it can fall short. ""we agree it is important for our staff and volunteers to be sensitive to and knowledgeable about the cultures of all our ethnic groups.  we are now looking at establishing a resource panel to guide and advise our staff on cultural matters,"" it said. ""we will also step up training efforts to enhance staff and volunteers' understanding and appreciation of our different cultures.  singaporeans becoming ""one people"" is a work in progress and so is the pa. ""the pa also said ms sarah's allegation in her e-mail on june 1, that the pa was ""hasty in sharing the name of the vendor"" to ""distance and deflect blame"" from itself, was untrue. it said the vendor had identified himself directly to ms sarah on may 28 and apologised, before the pa issued its statement on may 29. the straits times has contacted ms sarah for comment. she had written on instagram on june 1, after acknowledging pa's apology: ""as an ethnic minority, this isn't new â seeing others have a superficial understanding of my culture and then feeling like i have to explain it is. . .  exhausting.  but i want to help bridge that gap where possible through real and respectful conversations so that we can move beyond superficial understanding and promote deeper social cohesion. ""[embed]https://www. instagram. com/p/cpkvyrcbx8u/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading[/embed]in her june 7 talk show, she also said she had spoken up about the incident as she would like to see more ""tangible accountability"" from the pa to ensure such incidents do not happen again. this includes hearing about steps that they will take. she also noted that when minorities speak up about their experiences, they are not doing so in order to incite racial disharmony. the pa said in its post: ""enhancing our understanding of singapore's various races, religions and cultures is a ceaseless effort â this lapse having been a good reminder of this. . .  we hope that this incident will not tar the other good work which our staff and volunteers have done.

2021-06-15,Gareth Southgate is âEnglandâs biggest assetâ.,"former england defender gary neville has heaped praise on gareth southgate after the three lions' euros 2020 victory over croatia, labelling the manager ""our biggest asset"". england won their opening game at a european championships for the first time ever as raheem sterling's goal earned a 1-0 victory at wembley. southgate made several bold calls, starting kieran trippier out of position at left-back, raheem sterling in attack despite his poor club form and kalvin phillips in midfield alongside declan rice. however, the manager's team selection paid off, with trippier part of a new-look back four that was rarely troubled, while phillips set up sterling's winner in a superb display. ""i was shocked by the inclusion of trippier at left-back like most people but not in a doubting way because i don't doubt the manager,"" neville said on itv.  ""i think we've got an outstanding international manager who's got unbelievable experience. ""there are a lot of things that i would have said historically would have gone against england today.  two-o'clock kick-off, 30 degrees, playing against a team that passed us off the park in the last tournament, an experienced team.  not having his best defender, not having his best team. ""i thought he managed that game unbelievably today.  you talk about who the best player was, it might be kalvin phillips or raheem sterling but our biggest asset is our manager. ""the clamour in the past would have been to for grealish and he didn't even bring him off the bench.  so, he's willing to make the unpopular decisions, ones that some of us ultimately, at times, don't think he should make because he knows that group better than anyone.  he knows how to get a performance and a result better than anyone. ""he's had seven or eight tournaments now, as a coach now, with the u21s, as a player.  he's vastly experienced and i feel really comfortable with him there, as an england fan, and what he did today was really good.

2021-06-15,Man arrested after allegedly hitting neighbour with chain.,"a graphic designer was allegedly attacked by his neighbour with a bicycle chain in the corridor of his housing board flat on saturday.  he suffered a cut to his head that needed stitches. the victim, who wanted to be known only as mr toh, told chinese-language evening daily lianhe wanbao that the alleged attack occurred after he had moved his neighbour's bicycle. the police told the new paper they were alerted to the case of dispute that happened at block 130 ang mo kio avenue 3 at about 10. 30am. they arrested a 65-year-old man for voluntarily causing hurt with a dangerous weapon.  investigations are ongoing. speaking to wanbao, mr toh, 47, claimed that he had moved his neighbour's bicycle that was parked next to his window so that he could climb his ladder and clean the outside of the window. when the neighbour returned and saw that his bicycle had been moved, he allegedly pushed the bicycle with force, causing it to hit the ladder. shocked, mr toh turned around to ask his neighbour what was wrong. mr toh told wanbao: ""without a word, he took out a chain with a lock from the bicycle basket and started attacking me. ""the alleged attack caused mr toh to fall off the ladder and he felt severe pain on the back of his head. he ran to a nearby unit to ask for help from a woman.  she took a towel to stem the bleeding and mr toh claimed she also stepped forward to stop the neighbour from attacking him again. mr toh, who was in a daze, said he was concerned for the safety of his children who were in the house. the divorcee's 14-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son were visiting him as it was the school holidays. he said: ""i was dizzy from being beaten up, but i remembered that my front door was unlocked. ""i was worried that the attacker would run into the house and hurt my children. ""fortunately, the woman living next door helped attend to my children. ""mr toh was taken to khoo teck puat hospital by the singapore civil defence force. wanbao reported that he needed five stitches for a 4cm wound on his head.  he was discharged on the same day. mr toh has been living with three tenants in the unit for about two years. he alleged that the neighbour has been spitting and throwing garbage outside his unit and that the incidents started a month after he had moved in in 2019. mr toh said: ""my injury is of secondary concern.  i am more worried about how this incident will affect my children.

2021-06-15,Use of wedding pic for Raya ânot racistâ: People's Association.,"singapore â while the use of a malay-muslim couple's wedding photo as a standee in hari raya decorations by the people's association (pa) last month was ""culturally insensitive"", it was certainly not ""racist"", said the pa in a facebook post on monday (14 june).  ""it is not right to raise the allegation of racism, without basis, to stoke emotions and sentiments,"" said the pa in a detailed post, adding that it saw ""no point"" in proceeding with an arranged meeting with sarah bagharib and her husband razif abdullah. in an instagram post on 28 may, sarah had highlighted the use of the photo to create a standee alongside a decorative platform and banner depicting radin mas member of parliament melvin yong and his hari raya wishes for residents.  noting that neither she nor her husband had given consent for the photo to be used by the pa, sarah added, ""the inappropriate appropriation and use of our cultural symbol only succeeded in showing people('s) association's superficial understanding of malay/singaporean muslim culture"".  the post has garnered almost 18,000 likes.  in its post on monday, the pa noted that it had removed the standee and apologised to the couple, as well as posting a public apology on its social media platforms.  its post on 29 may revealed that warabi enterprise (art studio) had been engaged by radin mas constituency office (co) to design and put up hari raya decorations at the tiong bahru orchid estate. however, in the process, the vendor downloaded sarah's photo from an online source and then used it for a cut-out standee.  and while the pa spoke to the vendor on the seriousness of the incident, it stressed, ""the pa, including radin mas co, take responsibility for this error as we have oversight of the matter. ""in addition, the pa offered on monday to meet with the couple to apologise in person.  ""we also wished to clarify our position, elaborate on the steps we have taken to prevent such incidents from recurring, and hear her suggestions of how we might improve at the meeting. ""however, it claimed that sarah had said this incident ""perpetuate(s) the racist culture"" and characterised the incident as ""racist"".  in an instagram live interview with walid j.  abdullah last tuesday, said the pa, she also insinuated that pa staff and volunteers did not find anything wrong with the standee as they might be ""blind to racism"". ""these are accusations we reject,"" said the pa. furthermore, in sarah's public social media posts about her upcoming meeting with the pa, she had made a public call for anyone to ""please share your messages/suggestions to pa here and we'll share them"".   ""we find this odd,"" said the pa.  ""we do not see why our meeting should be appropriated as a platform for her to funnel the views and comments of persons unrelated to the incident. ""the pa added, ""all these lead us to believe her purpose in agreeing to meet with us has gone far beyond the radin mas incident.  we therefore see no point in proceeding with the meeting. ""it also claimed that sarah's email to the pa on 1 june alleged that it was ""hasty in sharing the name of the vendor"" in order to ""distance and deflect blame"" from itself.  ""this is untrue.  the vendor had identified himself directly to ms sarah on 28 may, and apologised.  this was before pa issued our statement on 29 may,"" said the pa.

2021-06-15,Former head of Myanmar's COVID-19 vaccination programme arrested.,"the former head of myanmar's covid-19 immunisation programme has been arrested and faces charges of high treason for colluding with opponents of the military authorities, state media reported on monday (jun 14). myanmar's healthcare system and coronavirus prevention measures have collapsed since the army seized power on feb 1 and overthrew elected leader aung san suu kyi, whose government had successfully stopped two waves of the virus. on sunday, reported cases surged to their highest since shortly after the coup. doctors and other medical workers have been at the forefront of a civil disobedience movement (cdm), leading strikes that have paralysed official and private business.  dozens have been arrested and hundreds more are wanted. the global new light of myanmar said htar htar lin had been arrested on jun 10 and she was also accused of working with an underground national unity government (nug). ""according to her confession, she not only joined the cdm and formed the cdm core group together with other cdm doctors and staff but also colluded with terrorist nug,"" it said. reuters was unable to reach her or any lawyer representing her for comment. the paper said she and 11 other doctors would face charges that included high treason, incitement and colluding with an illegal organisation. the junta has branded the nug set up by supporters of suu kyi and other opponents of military rule as a terrorist group. the arrest of htar htar lin and other doctors was condemned by us-based physicians for human rights. ""dr htar htar lin's arbitrary arrest is yet another sign that the military junta will stop at nothing in its war against myanmar's health workers,"" said jennifer leigh, an epidemiologist serving as the group's myanmar researcher. the 373 new cases of covid-19 reported on sunday was the highest since feb 3, just before testing collapsed in the wake of the coup. downloadour appor subscribe to our telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna. asia/telegramit looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

by a 26-year-old man instead. the victim had put up an advertisement on platform locanto expecting elder women to reply. he instead received a reply from muhammad al-masfuiin mushin, who pretended to be a woman to lure the victim to his flat. al-masfuiin, a singaporean, was jailed for 10 months on monday (14 june), after he pleaded guilty to one count of obtaining the sexual service of a minor under 18the victim cannot be named due to a gag order protecting his identity. on 16 june 2019, the teen got into a heated argument with his mother and was kicked out of the house.  in need of money, he placed an advertisement on locanto, which he had downloaded two years ago in order to earn money by providing sexual services. the advertisement was titled ""toyboy fantasy satisfies you- 18"", and stated that he was looking for a ""sugar mummy"" who could pay him in return for sexual services.  he included his mobile phone number and two photographs of himself. the next day, al-masfuiin saw the advertisement and decided to chat up the victim while posing as a woman.  he told the boy, ""i'm looking for a young boy to be my sex slave"" and asked the victim for his photographs and body statistics. when the victim asked if he was male or female, al-masfuiin said she was female.  the victim told him that he was 17 years old and in need of money as he had been chased out of his house. as a ""woman"", al-masfuiin asked the victim for a threesome with ""her"" and ""her boyfriend"", even though there would be no female involved.  the victim agreed and asked for $250 per meet up. at about 10. 38pm that day, the victim messaged al-masfuiin to ask if they were able to meet up.  al-masfuiin was aware that the victim had no place to stay. he told the victim that he could stay at ""her boyfriend's place"" and that ""he'll send a grab to let you stay over"".  al-masfuiin texted that he also expected the boy to service ""her boyfriend"". al-masfuiin then arranged transport for the victim.  at about 1am on 18 june 2019, al-masfuiin sent a grab to the victim, who asked al-masfuiin if ""she"" was joining the sex session.  al-masfuiin replied ""she might not"" but that her ""boyfriend will tell me if you did a great job at sex"". when the victim asked if the boyfriend knew his age, al-masfuiin replied ""yes"" and ""i like my boys young"". after the victim arrived at al-masfuiin's apartment, al-masfuiin told him to take a shower while he sat on the sofa bed in the living room masturbating himself.  the two engaged in sexual acts, with al-masfuiin overpowering the boy when the latter resisted.  after the incident, the boy went to sleep. he woke at about 8. 30am and asked al-masfuiin for money to go to work.  al-masfuiin took out a $50 note from his wallet and handed it to the victim before the two parted ways. according to court documents, a police officer performing foot patrol came across the victim on 18 june 2019 at toa payoh central.  during the course of investigations, the officer discovered messages relating to him providing sexual services, in his phone.  al-masfuiin was arrested afterwards.  commercial sex with a minor under 18 carries a

2021-06-15,Opinion.,"advertisementsupported bybinyamin appelbaumby binyamin appelbaummr.  appelbaum is a member of the editorial board. the decline of corporate taxation in recent decades is generally blamed on pirate states like luxembourg, ireland and bermuda, which offer an alluring combination of very low tax rates and an unembarrassed enthusiasm for allowing companies to play make-believe. but the pirates have a silent partner: the united states. generations of american policymakers haven't shown much interest in collecting money from corporations.  regarding corporate taxation as politically necessary but economically suspect, they have responded to tax evasion by making disapproving noises.  they have allowed companies to pretend profits are earned in low-tax countries and then cited the loss of tax revenue as the justification for tax cuts.  little wonder the united states collects a smaller share of tax revenue from corporations than any other major economy does. the biden administration has put forward a plausible plan to break with this pattern and make companies pay more taxes by raising domestic rates and penalizing firms that shift profits to tax havens.  it has won the support of other leading economies for an international minimum corporate tax rate.  but a familiar obstacle, congress, stands in the way. the anti-tax radicals in the republican party oppose any plan to collect more money from corporations â even money otherwise paid to foreign governments â and an international agreement could require the support of two-thirds of the senate.  the biden administration could achieve many of its goals without a deal by legislating changes to u. s.  tax law.  but there's a lack of enthusiasm among some senate democrats, too.  rumblings of discontent already have prompted the white house to pare its plans. the basic case for more corporate taxation is that the government needs the money.  the biden administration plans to use it to rebuild bridges, replace water pipes and increase renewable energy output.  some economists argue higher taxes will slow economic growth, but decades of cutting corporate taxes haven't exactly produced the promised economic miracles.  even if there is a price, taking money from the rich for the benefit of the many can still be sound policy.  the distribution of prosperity matters, as well. the work has to begin at home.  the focus on foreign tax havens has obscured the extent to which the united states has become a tax haven for u. s.  companies.  the statutory tax rate is 21 percent.  but american multinationals paid just 7. 8 percent of domestic profits in taxes in 2018, according to the congressional joint committee on taxation.  while those companies made liberal use of foreign tax havens, too, the total tax rate on their foreign profits was actually a little higher than the tax rate on their domestic profits. the biden administration has proposed raising the domestic rate to 28 percent and imposing a 21 percent tax rate on profits reported in foreign countries. it is also seeking an international agreement on a 15 percent minimum corporate tax rate.  firms would pay at least that much, irrespective of where they operated or claimed to operate.  they would get credit for taxes paid in foreign countries, but if they paid less than 15 percent of profits, the home country would collect the difference. such a deal would limit the competitive disadvantage of american companies.  janet yellen, the treasury secretary, who is leading the negotiations, argues that it would also benefit the global economy by ending tax-rate bidding wars and encouraging countries to compete instead by educating workers and investing in infrastructure. some pirate states, notably ireland, have vocally protested, arguing that they use low tax rates to promote legitimate economic development.  for ireland, this is a half-truth.  for even smaller tax havens, it's pure nonsense.  companies that book profits on the isle of jersey are playing the same game as freighters that fly the flag of liberia. multinationals book about 25 percent of profits in tax havens where, on average, they have 11 percent of assets and 5 percent of their employees, according to the organization for economic cooperation and development. ireland's position is understandable but unacceptable and ultimately not much of an obstacle.  if the major economies agree to adopt the american scheme, ireland can keep on pretending that it's a major center of corporate activity, but corporations will still have to pay their bills back home.  ireland would lose most of its utility as a tax haven. the u. s.  wants a deal for another reason, too.  countries have generally sought to limit tax conflicts by agreeing that corporations should pay taxes in the countries where they create value.  but that principle has been strained by the rise of american technology firms like facebook and google that make money in countries where they have little or no physical footprint.  european countries are moving to tax those firms, arguing that, for example, google is not just delivering a service to its users in france but also acquiring valuable information from french users.  as part of the broader deal, the united states is offering to let those countries tax a portion of the tech companies' profits in exchange for dropping the new taxes. excitement about the prospect of an international agreement should be taken with a grain of history.  just a few decades ago, the average corporate tax rate in the developed world was almost 50 percent.  corporations and anti-tax ideologues have taken advantage of globalization to achieve a shift that is likely to endure for the foreseeable future.  a 15 percent minimum tax rate would simply arrest their progress.  but that's how change begins: you stop, you turn around, and then you start walking in the other direction. the

2021-06-15,Football: Sterling gives England opening Euro 2020 win over Croatia.,"london: raheem sterling finally found his tournament touch when his 61st-minute goal gave england a deserved 1-0 win over croatia at wembley on sunday (jun 13) as they began a european championship with a victory for the first time in nine attempts. sterling, something of a surprise starter after a flat end to the domestic season but a favourite of manager gareth southgate, slid home after great work by kalvin phillips to end an individual drought that had run through england's three previous major tournaments. ""it feels good.  i grew up two minutes down the road, so i knew i had to score here, and it was a great feeling to do it,"" said the wembley-raised forward. southgate said he was unaware of england's previous run of opening-game failures despite having played in one of them in 1996 but, as expected, was not getting carried away by a solid but unexceptional display. ""it's for everybody else to get excited and throw their beer around and do whatever they want,"" he said.  ""it's brilliant to give that joy to people.  but for us, it's on to the next one and preparing for a really tough game on friday (against scotland). ""but i was really pleased with the way we settled so quickly.  big occasion, sweltering hot day, every reason to look nervous at the start, but we didn't.  with and without the ball, we were composed.  although it was always going to be a game of few clear chances, we looked the bigger threat throughout. ""the game lacked the jeopardy of the teams' 2018 world cup semi-final, won by croatia, and losing on sunday was no disaster for them given the way the draw pans out, but it was a morale-boosting victory for england as they set off once again in search of their first title since 1966. pace flaggedroared on by a noisy 22,500 crowd a quarter of wembley's capacity they started full of bright intentions and put huge pressure on the visitors. phil foden, his bleached hair channelling paul gascoigne from euro 96, almost gave them a dream start when he cut in from the right and curled a low shot against a post. phillips, impressive all afternoon, then had a 25-yard shot blocked but, instead of riding the early momentum, england lost their way and, with the sun beating down, the pace and energy seeped out of the game either side of the break. england eventually shook themselves out of the torpor and struck when phillips drove through the retreating defence, rode two tackles and played the ball expertly into the path of the darting sterling who, under pressure, just got enough on the ball to steer it home. sterling had looked lively all day and celebrated his first major tournament goal with gusto, though he should have added a second 13 minutes later but blazed wildly over the bar. another bright spot for england was the introduction of substitute jude bellingham who, at 17 years and 349 days, became the youngest player to appear in the european championship finals. croatia also threw on their attacking subs as they tried to show a bit more ambition but though england's defence looked a little shaky at times there were few chances for an equalizer as, conversely to england, they lost their opening euro match for the first time in their six tournaments. ""we didn't do enough up front and couldn't engineer our trademark fast-flowing moves, but i am optimistic that we'll improve and get it right in the next two games,"" said coach zlatko dalic. they are against scotland and the czech republic, who meet on monday, with croatia playing the czechs in glasgow on friday. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-15,Opinion.,"israel's knessett voted to depose longtime prime minister benjamin netanyahu on sunday, ending (for now) the bibi era.  with the inclusion of a member from the arab ra'am party  in the nation's new governing coalition, the jewish state now has an opportunity to usher in an era of reconciliation. arab-jewish relations in israel have always been tense.  israel kept arab areas under martial law from its founding in 1948 until 1966.  most israeli arabs are not required to serve in the israeli defense forces and relatively few volunteer, although their participation rose during the pandemic.  they compose roughly 21 percent of the population, but nearly all israeli arabs still live in nearly monolithically arab-populated towns.  they remain poorer and less-educated than israeli jews, even as they have equal political and legal rights. it's no surprise, then, that arab voters have rarely supported mainstream jewish political parties.  arab parties have traditionally received about 80 percent of the vote from israeli arabs, and those parties have largely been either extreme leftists, such as the communist-backed hadash, or been connected to palestinian nationalism, such as ahmad tibi's ta'al.  the latter is so prominent and so loathed by the israeli right that netanyahu's campaign slogan in the 2020 election was ""bibi or tibi,"" a reference to how netanyahu's opponents would have had to likely rely on the votes of tibi's party in the knesset to prevail.  those parties, needless to say, could not be part of any governing coalition. israeli arabs who do vote for jewish parties also tend to vote heavily for those on the left, such as meretz or labor.  since there has not been a prime minister from the left since the 1999 election, this means that israel's arabs have largely been politically sidelined for decades.  the result is that many israeli arabs feel disengaged from the nation in which they live, voting at much lower rates than jews. israel's jewish politicians are no dummies, so many started to court the arab sector in this year's election.  they knew that even a small uptick in votes could make the difference in a nation split down the middle.  the most shocking volte face came from netanyahu himself, who actively campaigned in arab towns pledging to increase funding for arab priorities.  that effort helped him somewhat, as his likud party's share of the vote rose in many arab towns.  but the real winner was an arab himself, mansour abbas. abbas is the leader of the conservative islamist ra'am party.  ra'am is the political arm of the southern branch of that country's muslim brotherhood, and its charter strongly condemns zionism.  abbas, however, put those concerns to the side and ran on a simple platform of bread-and-butter concerns.  he went into the election arguing that israeli arabs have a lot to gain if they deal with the jewish majority rather than fight it.  he said he was open to supporting either netanyahu or his opponent, and focused his demands on fighting rampant crime in the arab community, legalizing bedouin settlements that israel has not recognized, and increasing funding for economic development.  his party surprised most observers by passing the electoral threshold and entering the knesset, israel's parliament, with four seats.  the results confirmed israel's roughly even split between pro- and anti-netanyahu factions, making abbas the country's kingmaker. the 47-year-old abbas exploited his crucial position masterfully.  he went on israeli television in april, giving a prime-time speech in hebrew declaring that he is a ""proud arab and muslim, [and] a citizen of the state of israel. "" he negotiated with both sides, and could have easily ended up backing netanyahu had ra'am's participation in a pro-netanyahu government not been blocked by bezalel smotrich, the leader of the religious zionist party.  he ended up providing the crucial votes for a government led by israel's first orthodox jewish prime minister, naftali bennett.  abbas got everything he wanted, including a promise to spend 53 billion israeli new shekels â about $16 billion â on fighting crime in arab towns and ""reduc[ing] gaps"" between the jewish and arab sectors. this unprecedented political involvement heralds the chance for a new understanding between israel's jews and arabs.  much as the abraham accords promise the chance for reconciliation between jews and arabs among arab states, these abbas accords promise the chance for domestic reconciliation as well.  ethnic violence erupted within israel during the recent war with hamas, starkly demonstrating how important improving relations with israeli arabs is to israeli security.  if abbas can succeed, more arabs will see that they have a concrete stake in israel's future.  that can only make israel's future even brighter. israel shall always be, as its basic law says, a jewish and democratic state.  sunday's historic vote will help israeli arabs to see themselves as an honored part of that state. sign up to receive my

""the group of seven takes advantage of xinjiang-related issues to engage in political manipulation and interfere in china's internal affairs, which we firmly oppose,"" an embassy spokesman said in a statement. the statement accused the g7 of ""lies, rumours and baseless accusations"". human rights groups say china has rounded up an estimated 1 million uyghurs and other minorities in xinjiang into internment camps, which beijing says is to eradicate islamic extremism. ""we will promote our values, including by calling on china to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms,"" the g7 communique read. at their first physical summit in nearly two years, leaders of the seven nations announced a number ofpledges on covid-19 vaccinations, climate change, rights and trade. they also called for a new investigation in china into the origins of covid-19 prompting a response from the chinese embassy that the work needs to be done in a ""scientific, objective and fair manner"", without agreeing to a new probe. ""the current epidemic is still raging around the world, and the traceability work should be carried out by global scientists and should not be politicised,"" the embassy said. the coronavirus first emerged in central china in late 2019, and the world health organization sent a team of international experts in january to probe its origins. but their long-delayed report published in march drew no firm conclusions, and the investigation has since faced criticism for lacking transparency and access. the g7 also announced a new infrastructure fund which president biden said would be ""much more equitable"" than china's massive belt and road initiative. the chinese embassy statement complained in response that the ""accusations against china on economic and trade issues in the communique are inconsistent with the facts and are unreasonable"". it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

""no your honour,"" the older taylor replied.  ""no,"" said his son. extradited to japan from the united states in march, they are being held at the same jail in tokyo where ghosn was detained.  they could face up to three years in prison. wearing black jackets and pants, white shirts and plastic slippers, they were were led into court with ropes threaded through handcuffs and tied around their waists. prosecutors accused them of helping ghosn evade punishment and escape https://www. reuters. com/article/us-nissan-ghosn-charge-idcakbn2be0g1 to lebanon from western japan's kansai airport, receiving us$1. 3 million for their services, some of which was paid to an advertising company owned by the younger taylor. the prosecutors' statement on monday, which described the younger taylor as a frequent visitor to lebanon, said planning for the escape began around six months before ghosn fled. the statement also said that ghosn's wife carole ghosn sought help from michael taylor, with ghosn later contacting  him from tokyo with a phone he had hidden from japanese authorities. a third man george-antoine zayek, recruited by the taylors, traveled to japan later in 2019 to find a way through airport security, settling on the private jet terminal at kansai airport as the best route out, the prosecutors said.  zayek remains at large. luggage that does not fit through the security scanning machine there is inspected by hand.  that check, however, can be waived by the pilot. the taylors' lawyers in the united states waged a months-long battle to prevent their extradition to japan, arguing they could not be prosecuted for helping someone ""bail jump"" and that they could face relentless interrogations and torture. suspects in japan are interrogated without their lawyers present and are often denied bail before trial. japan's conviction rate is 99per cent. at the time of ghosn's escape, he was awaiting trial on charges that he understated his compensation in nissan's financial statements by 9. 3 billion yen (us$85 million) over a decade and enriched himself at his employer's expense through payments to car dealerships. ghosn, who denies any wrongdoing, remains a fugitive in his childhood home, which has no extradition treaty with japan. greg kelly, a former nissan executive charged with helping ghosn hide his earnings, is also standing trial in tokyo.  he denies the charges https://www. reuters. com/business/autos-transportation/court-former-nissan-executive-kelly-denies-helping-ghosn-hide-earnings-2021-05-12.

2021-06-15,China nuclear plant operators release gas in bid to fix issue.,"beijing: gas was deliberately released from a nuclear power plant in southern china as operators work to fix an issue at the facility, its french part-owner said on monday (jun 14) following a us media report of a potential leak. cnn said the us government is assessing a report of a leak at the taishan nuclear power plant in populous guangdong province after framatome, a french firm that partly owns it, warned of an ""imminent radiological threat"". edf, the majority owner of framatome, said the plant's number one reactor experienced a build-up of noble gases in its primary circuit, which is part of the cooling system. the gas leaked after the coating on some fuel rods had deteriorated, said an edf spokesman, who asked not to be named. noble gases are elements which have low chemical reactivity in this case it was xenon and krypton. the gases were collected and treated as part of a process to remove any radiocativity before their release, which was normal and ""in accordance with regulations"", the spokesman said. ""we are not in a scenario of an accident with a melting core,"" he said. ""we are not talking about contamination, we are talking about controlled emissions. ""framatome said in a statement that the plant was operating ""within the safety parameters"" despite the""performance issue"".  edf called an extraordinary meeting of the plant's board over the matter. david fishman, manager at energy-focused consulting group the lantau group, said a cracked fuel road can potentially cause a small release of fission materials into the cooling loop, ""where it wouldn't normally be"". ""failed fuel or cracked fuel is a fairly normal and common undesirably certainly but not uncommon phenomenon in the nuclear fuel industry,"" fishman told afp. not at 'crisis level'citing a letter from framatome to the us energy department, cnn said the warning included an accusation that the chinese safety authority was raising the acceptable limits for radiation outside the facility in order to avoid having to shut it down. but a us official told the broadcaster that the administration of president joe biden believes the facility is not yet at ""crisis level"". the operator of the station, state-owned china general nuclear power group (cgn), said in a statement on sunday evening that ""the environmental indicators of taishan nuclear power plant and its surroundings are normal"". it did not reference any leak or incident at the power station, which it said meets ""the requirements of nuclear safety regulations and power plant technical specifications. ""the international atomic energy agency, a un body, said it had contacted its counterpart in china regarding the issue. ""at this stage, the agency has no indication that a radiological incident occurred,"" the iaea said in a statement. afp did not get an immediate response to a request for comment from either the chinese foreign ministry or the chinese nuclear power group. a problem with a cracked fuel rod would have to be logged by the chinese nuclear safety administration with a mitigation report to fix the problem, fishman said. fishman said framatome possibly reached out to the us to seek approval for their work at taishan because cgn is on a us entity blacklist. ""if (framatome) were going to transfer over any information that they have gotten from working in the us, they would have to apply for an exemption . . .  because cgn is on the us entity list,"" he said. ""it is a no-fly zone for any us information, any information or data or technology or ip to go to china. ""epr reactorspowered up in 2018, the taishan plant was the first worldwide to operate a next-generation epr nuclear reactor, a pressurised water design that has been subject to years of delays in similar european projects in britain, france and finland. epr reactors have been touted as promising advances in safety and efficiency over conventional reactors while producing less waste. nuclear plants supplied less than five per cent of china's annual electricity needs in 2019, according to the national energy administration, but this share is expected to grow as beijing attempts to become carbon neutral by 2060. china has 47 nuclear plants with a total generation capacity of 48. 75 gigawatts the world's third highest after the united states and france and has invested billions of dollars to develop its nuclear energy sector. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

spain boss luis enrique on alvaro morata: ""i think alvaro had a great game.  of course we all want to take our chances, but other players had chances too.  i think he's used to it, but of course we want to see that support from the fans""by  pa media  tuesday 15 june 2021 00:06, ukluis enrique has defended alvaro morata following the spain striker's two costly misses in monday night's goalless euro 2020 draw with sweden. spain boss enrique insisted on-loan juventus hitman morata had a ""great game"" despite spurning two gilt-edged chances in seville. marcus berg missed a major opening for sweden too, but spain dominated throughout, attempting 954 passes to the swedes' 174. enrique would not be drawn on sweden's containment tactics, before insisting spain have no need to worry about their chances of progressing from group e. ""i think alvaro had a great game,"" said enrique.  ""of course we all want to take our chances, but other players had chances too. ""i think he's used to it, but of course we want to see that support from the fans. ""that's football though, it would have been nice to dedicate a win to the fans because they were fantastic for most of the game today. 17 spain had 17 shots in tonight's draw against sweden, their highest tally in a major tournament game (european championships + world cup) without scoring since having 25 attempts against switzerland in a group stage match at the 2010 world cup.  stalemate.  #euro2020 #esp #swe pic. twitter. com/bbvt0vopun""we are going to analyse this game in detail as we always do.  but in this case i think it's really clear, we've all seen what happened this evening so there's really not too much to go into. ""we were by far the better team.  the opposition tried to hang back, we completely controlled the game and tried to create as many chances as possible. ""we had sufficient chances to win the game.  what went wrong? it's the fact we didn't take those chances. ""it's very clear and we all saw it. ""asked about sweden's defensive approach, enrique continued: ""i don't have much of an opinion. ""the coach decided how he wanted to play, and that's completely right of course.  at times you can make that decision and the other team can outdo you. ""they played the way they usually do against us with two strikers. 1 spain completed 419 passes in the first half against sweden, the highest figure in the opening 45 minutes of a european championship game since we have this data available (1980).  control.  #euro2020 #esp #swe""we only allowed them to have one or two chances, whereas we made the sufficient number of chances to win the game. ""but i really don't have an opinion on that, that's a question for mr andersson not me. ""i think we were unlucky to draw tonight.  we had far more chances that's football and we're aware of that. ""we still aspire to winning the group.  if not we'll aim for second and if we can't do that we'll try to be one of the best third-placed teams. ""sweden boss janne andersson was left frustrated to discover striker marcus berg had been abused on social media for his big missed opportunity in front of goal. asked for his opinion on berg receiving online criticism, andersson replied: ""are you joking? you're joking when you're telling me this. ""you're saying that because he missed a big chance that people are sending him threats?""are people being negative? well i don't think you can be negative towards a player who worked his socks off on the pitch. ""marcus berg probably had the most dangerous chance of the match. ""but overall i cannot be anything other than satisfied, because we played really well and we are developing good tactical flexibility. ""i think we could certainly have lost the game but we could also have won the game.  we had some chances also. ""away from home in spain i think they put in a fantastic performance.  spain are brutal with the ball.

2021-06-15,US father-son duo admit helping ex-Nissan chief Ghosn flee Japan.,"tokyo: an american father-son duo admitted their role in orchestrating former nissan chief carlos ghosn's audacious escape from japan as they made their first appearance before a tokyo court on monday (jun 14). former special forces operative michael taylor, 60, and his 28-year-old son peter were extradited by united states authorities over claims that they smuggled ghosn out of the country in a music equipment case as he awaited trial. at the tokyo district court, the pair said that they did not contest the facts laid out by prosecutors in an indictment, effectively conceding their role in the saga. ""is there any mistake in what the prosecutor just read?"" the judge asked each man in turn.  both replied no. michael taylor was led in first to the courtroom, with his hands cuffed in front of him.  he wore plastic slippers, dark trousers and a white shirt with no tie. his son was brought in after, with both men wearing face masks. the pair face up to three years in prison if convicted of helping ghosn currently an international fugitive living in lebanon, which has no extradition treaty with japan. ghosn was out on bail while awaiting trial on four counts of financial misconduct, which he denies, when he managed to slip past authorities onto a private jet, transit in turkey and land in lebanon. on monday, prosecutors laid out again the almost cinematic details of the december 2019 escape, including that the taylors hid ghosn in a case to slip him past security at an airport. ""you helped him escape,"" said one prosecutor to the two men, who listened to proceedings through a translation earpiece. ghosn's flight was hugely embarrassing for japanese authorities, with us prosecutors calling it ""one of the most brazen and well-orchestrated escape acts in recent history"". us$1. 3 millionthe taylors fought their extradition to tokyo, claiming that they could face torture-like conditions, and have not commented on their case since arriving in early march. local prosecutors declined to comment on their arraignment before the trial, but japanese media said that both men admitted wrongdoing during questioning. public broadcaster nhk has said that peter received 144 million yen (us$1. 3 million) from the ghosns for their help. the asahi shimbun daily said that the pair spent most of the money on preparations for the escape, including the costs of chartering a private jet, claiming that they were not paid for their help. ghosn remains at large in lebanon, where he was questioned last month by french investigators over a series of alleged financial improprieties. among the allegations are improper financial interactions with renault-nissan's distributor in oman, payments by a dutch subsidiary to consultants, and lavish parties organised at the palace of versailles. the questioning took place with his defence team and a lebanese prosecutor present.  ghosn was heard as a witness as he would need to be in france to be formally indicted. others involved in the ghosn case have faced legal proceedings, including his former aide at nissan, greg kelly, who is also on trial in tokyo for his alleged role in underreporting the tycoon's income. and a turkish court has sentenced two pilots and another employee of a small private airline to four years and two months in prison for their role in ghosn's escape. ghosn switched planes in turkey on his way to lebanon, and the three turks were charged with involvement in a conspiracy to smuggle a migrant. a lebanese national still at large is also suspected of orchestrating ghosn's escape from japan. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

2021-06-15,Chinese scientist at center of virus controvery denies lab leak theory.,"the chinese scientist at the center of theories that the coronavirus pandemic originated with a leak from her specialized lab in the city of wuhan has denied her institution was to blame for the health disaster. ""how on earth can i offer up evidence for something where there is no evidence?"" dr shi zhengli told the new york times in rare comments to the media. ""i don't know how the world has come to this, constantly pouring filth on an innocent scientist,"" she told the us daily. us president joe biden last month ordered intelligence agencies to investigate the origin of the pandemic, including the lab leak theory. the leak hypothesis had been floated earlier during the global outbreak, including by biden's predecessor donald trump, but was widely dismissed as a conspiracy theory. but it has gained increasing traction recently, fueled by reports that three researchers from the wuhan institute of virology became sick in 2019 after visiting a bat cave in the southwestern chinese province of yunnan. shi is an expert in bat coronaviruses, and some scientists have said she could have been leading so-called ""gain-of-function"" experiments in which scientists increase the strength of a virus to better study its effects on hosts. according to the new york times, in 2017 shi and her colleagues at the wuhan laboratory published a report on an experiment ""in which they created new hybrid bat coronaviruses by mixing and matching parts of several existing ones â including at least one that was nearly transmissible to humans â in order to study their ability to infect and replicate in human cells. ""but in an email to the paper, shi said her experiments differed from gain-of-function experiments since they did not seek to make a virus more dangerous.  instead they were trying to understand how the virus might jump across species.

2021-06-15,Karen Mok suffers backlash for wearing Dolce and Gabbana.,"anger against the italian brand in chinaauthordatecategoryhong kong â hong kong singer karen mok suffered a backlash in china because of an outfit she wore in a new music video.  she has since apologised for her actions.  over the weekend, the 51-year-old singer held her karen mok the ultimate grand slam show concert in hong kong.  last week, mok launched her latest album, the voyage, which contained woman for all seasons, a reissue of her 2001 song of the same name. mok was seen wearing a bathrobe from the italian luxury brand dolce & gabbana (d&g) in the music video for the new song.  she also used the photo of her in the robe as her profile picture on weibo, the chinese micro-blogging site.  this caused a backlash in china, where many had been angered by a 2018 d&g campaign they viewed as culturally insensitive. karen mok removed photos of her wearing the outfit from her socials and all platforms.  picture: instagramsome chinese netizens demanded to know why the singer was promoting the brand while others even called for a boycott of mok.  on saturday (june 12), the topic trended on weibo for several hours.  the singer has since removed photos of her wearing the dolce & gabbana outfit from her social media accounts and the music video from all platforms, reported the straits times.  mok's agency and designer, who were involved in the choice of the outfit, have also apologised on weibo. in late 2018, d&g caused an uproar in china when footage from its advertising campaign showed a chinese model in a red d&g dress struggling to eat italian foods such as spaghetti and cannoli pastry with chopsticks. the issue escalated after screenshots of messages sent from d&g co-founder stefano gabbana's instagram account were leaked, in which he allegedly said negative things about china.  following that incident, several celebrities such as singer karry wang and actress dilraba dilmurat ended their ties with the brand. born on june 2, 1970, karen joy morris, known popularly as karen mok is a leading asian pop singer and actress with a career spanning three decades.  she was the first female hong kong singer to win the golden melody award and has won it a total of three times.  she has released 17 solo studio albums, starred in over 40 movies, has over 15 million followers on leading chinese social media site weibo and holds the guinness world record for the highest altitude music concert. /tisgfollow us on social mediasend in your scoops to news@theindependent. sg send in

2021-06-15,Malaysia's reef sharks stricken with mystery skin disease.,"kuala lumpur: marine biologists are investigating a mystery skin disease afflicting whitetip reef sharks in malaysia, with some early reports suggesting rising sea temperatures could be to blame. named for the distinctive white tips on their fins, whitetip reef sharks are typically found resting in schools around reefs in the day and are a popular attraction for divers.  they become active at night to hunt for small fish and other animals. pictures of one of the sharks with what appeared to be spots and lesions on its head went viral on social media in april after being taken by an underwater photographer off sabah state on borneo island. soon after, divers at sipadan island, a famed diving destination nearby, and a team of experts from the state's university and government and conservation groups began seeing the skin disease in every group of sharks they encountered. attempting to diagnose what could be causing the illness, the team found the sea surface temperature at sipadan had risen to 29. 5 degrees celsius in may, a degree higher than in 1985. ""we can almost certainly pin the warming ocean as having a role in what we are seeing with the sickly sharks in sipadan,"" said davies austin spiji, a senior marine biologist with non-profit conservation group reef guardian, ruling out human factors as sipadan is a marine protected area where fishing is strictly prohibited, and there are no settlements or industries nearby. the reported sightings coincide with reports of coral bleaching in the area, according to mohamed shariff mohamed din, a professor in aquatic veterinary studies with universiti putra malaysia. ""we cannot ignore that changes are happening there due to higher temperatures,"" mohamed shariff said. a full scientific study is yet to be done, however. in may, the research team tried but failed to capture some of the sharks to secure samples for testing, said mabel manjaji-matsumoto, a senior lecturer with the borneo marine research institute of universiti malaysia sabah. ""if we can get shark specimens, we will surely at least be able to find out the pathogenic cause of the lesions,"" manjaji-matsumoto said, adding that the team plans to make another attempt in july. it looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
